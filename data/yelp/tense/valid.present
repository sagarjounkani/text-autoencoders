pizza is pretty good !
everything is usually pretty fresh and hot .
there is something about this pizza that is addictive .
there is very little sauce , fairly dry cheese , and a chewy crust .
i do n't know what to call it ... .
because every local i know loves monicals .
in fact , they even sell their french dressing online !
seriously , i 've looked . )
the pizza is pretty good , but not the best in champaign-urbana .
i prefer papa del 's .
awesome sauce and topping of seasonings .
oooh and a pitcher of fountain root beer is the perfect bev .
fast service , be ready to start eating the salad/breadsticks within minutes of ordering .
gim me some family pleaser now !
family pleaser is the way to go .
the toppings are just right too .
does anyone even order anything else ?
love the food , the service , everything .
i travel _ num _ nights/year for work so i order food a lot .
your company knows this ... yet continues to serve it ?
i like other much cheaper pizza than this .
love the thin crust pizza and the family/neighborhood atmosphere .
the pizza crust is so perfectly crispy .
the location is literally _ num _ miles from the house .
going to just go to the store for refund of the sauce and bread .
this is the worst monicals i have ever ate at .
within a month they have messed up _ num _ of our pizzas .
the pizzas have been soggy and tuff .
avoid this place at all costs !
not a terrible place to rent a budget truck from .
nothing special about it , but they get the job done .
this is a very nice hotel , especially for the price .
breakfast every morning is great ( not healthy ! )
the bartender mark is a great guy .
he has a ton of stories , who knows if they are true .
this place is absolutely amazing for the price .
i 'm always a sucker for pet parrots .
i 'm really not sure how this place has gotten such high ratings .
the complementary breakfast is not good .
overall , everything about this hotel has been repulsive and disappointing .
i 've been staying here over a month due to my job .
this has been over a month of getting breakfast .
the staff is very friendly , and the rooms are comfortable .
the breakfast is ok ... not great , but decent .
tip your breakfast attendants , people !
all in all , i give it _ num _ stars .
possible improvements and things to note : the breakfast crowd varies between week and weekend .
very helpful getting a wedding bouquet to dearest friends from _ num _ miles away .
blossom basket is awesome !
no luck with calling for any help in complaint .
ownership does n't seem to care .
blossom basket is my first stop for all of my floral needs and wants .
the staff is friendly and the quality of the product is exquisite .
i am definitely a fan of blossom basket !
what a way to run a quality business .
thank you blossom basket for a job well done !
i highly recommend them and wo n't use anyone else in champaign !
blossom basket are timely and efficient .
when i call them with an order , they do it right every time .
they are the only florist i call .
blossom basket florist makes beautiful flower arrangements .
i see a lot of them because i work in a hospital .
the blossom basket staff is courteous and friendly .
i highly recommend them .
their hours stink .
now they 've adopted a herd the cattle style of doing business .
take a number & wait .
i guess you can do business this way when you have a monopoly .
they even have kneeling buses for wheelchair dependent citizens .
the mass transit system in champaign-urbana is actually really good !
you can get almost anywhere by the bus !
oh mtd , how i miss you .
enter champaign-urbana mass transit district .
: ) the website is unfortunately abbreviated ( http : / / www.cumtd.com ) , but wonderfully comprehensive .
: ) i 've always been pretty indifferent about the cu mtd .
then , today , i read this : http : / / www.newsgazette.com/news/local/2009/04/09/no_mtd_service_planned_this_sunday public transportation is being suspended in observance of a religious holiday .
are you freakin ' kidding me ?
mtd is a great way to get to class when the weather is nasty .
at least the mtd buses are free to students .
and they are a blast when the bars close !
this is my 4rd year in uc and cu mtd is a life saver ... you can go almost everywhere with them almost anytime .
very useful when you get wind chills of _ num _ f ... .
my only complain is that sometimes the rides are too crowded .
i use the bus all the time and it 's a pleasure .
i 'm sure it 's only better now .
i 'm biased b/c i worked here for two years while on campus .
but this subway is much cleaner than the one on john st .
do n't wan na think about that .
great place for subs while running between classes !
it 's great during lunch hours when everything 's packed .
they work real quick , you 're normally out in less than _ num _ minutes .
it takes them forever to do anything .
: ( the students here are filled to the brim with boredom .
this is my favorite place to get my hair cut in all of c-u .
it 's a korean place , yes .
most of the other clients are korean , yes .
please check this place out !
this has been the worst haircut experience of my life .
spend a little bit more money and save yourself the trouble and disappointment .
i am male .
this is the worst place and the worst stuff i have ever met .
he just use the scissor to scrambling on your head and finish .
right now i have to use gatsby every single day !
never ever go this place again .
i am very very very unhappy .
do not go here !
the korean lady at red hair gives the best hair cuts ever .
clearly they do n't want my business !
i want a neck massage !
i want to feel sexy !
these ladies are pretty adorable .
now ... the bangs .
you need to specify exactly what you want to prevent them from butchering them .
make sure you get the lady !
she is really great and very friendly !
she always cuts fast and very stylishly .
also , this place is right on campus , which is great .
got my hair cut short and took care of the split ends .
nice korean run place , parking is difficult love getting my haircut here !
it 's only $ _ num _ for a women 's haircut .
sue and kee are absolutely amazing , they are very skilled and also friendly !
first , my apologies for not knowing the names of the hair stylists .
their popularity often means that appointments are booked solid a week in advance .
they 've always used scissors for everything except neck and sideburns .
many of the reviews below are quite dated .
i 'm not korean , and it has never been an issue .
one of the best in champaign area and the hairstylists are wonderful and nice !
one of the best in champaign area and the hairstylists are wonderful and nice !
they only take cash , which seemed strange .
the barber is highly skilled and easy to communicate with .
you know , i actually like rock 's .
rock 's is a decent bar/pub/grill / patio spot that is pleasant in the summer heat .
i can tell you right now that you are very wrong .
second , the bar has a much better atmosphere for watching the big game .
lastly , they serve the best horseshoes anywhere near campus .
you really have to go just to try one .
screw conservatives idea of planned parenthood .
so are you sans health insurance ?
it differs based on income .
plus , the staff is helpful , friendly , comforting and very knowledgeable .
need a refill on your birth control but do n't have contraceptive coverage ?
or need birth control and are too afraid to get your parents ' permission ?
we are living in _ num _ .
the sweetest planned parenthood i 've been to .
it 's obvious that they are heavily needed here .
this also means appointments fill up fast so do n't dawdle , y' hear ?
it can take up to two weeks depending on the procedure .
they have the requisite beach sunset pictures on the ceiling also , heh .
outside of the cliche and tired pro-life/choice argument ( nobody is pro-abortion .
way to address the sexy white elephant in the room .
the people who work here are really sweet and informative .
yay , let 's continue to oppress women 's sexuality !
... unbelievable ... i am considering a lawsuit .
i have never seen more unprofessional behavior .
as a low-income graduate student , i qualify for the illinois healthy women program .
i have already recommended champaign 's planned parenthood to my friends .
it 's now a beautiful , modern facility .
what 's worse than going to planned parenthood ?
... tick , tock ... ready for the answer ?
most of the time , the staff is great .
they are cheerful and seemingly happy to be doing their job .
i wish i remembered their names , but i do n't .
because i think this is a valuable service .
most of the time their providers are great .
do doctors have bad days ?
i am sure they do .
i 'm also sure they do that as well .
bottom line is ... it 's not super professional .
it happens , though .
nonetheless , they have always given me the information and services i needed .
the staff in champaign is amazing .
by far the best gynecology people i have ever been to .
they are very sweet and understanding .
i am no longer afraid of my yearly !
way to improperly utilize your resources .
i have been going to this location for a couple of years now .
i have always loved the staff they go above and beyond for people .
i am sad to be moving away from the awesome people here .
easy to make an appointment .
wide array of services and the staff are ready to answer any questions .
they like the campus and the teachers .
i have lots of friends who have attended this school .
there 's lots this school has to offer .
check this school out .
` at illnois , you 're not a number , you 're nine numbers . '
it 's a place that is easy to both love and hate .
grading is harsh here !
las is the catch-all college that gets shafted a lot .
many of my lectures were too big and in auditoriums were literally falling apart .
i 've had my smallest and favorite classes in aces .
i adore most of my professors i have had in this college .
i recommend aces , but only if you are truly interested in the curricula .
_ num _ classes are where learning goes to die .
the drunken anti-intellectual environment can be stifling if you do n't find a niche .
i like the chambana area , even if it has some minor annoyances .
the weather here is horrible .
you are always meeting new people who are cool and interesting .
college is just a stepping stone to work .
i have to say that uiuc did its job .
oh wait .
you can probably get that anywhere else .
what more do you want ?
to whom it may concern at the uiuc , thank you for finally dropping the chief as your mascot .
it 's a perfect distance from chicago .
go illini like much in life , you get out of uiuc what you put in .
champaign-urbana ... you either love it or you do n't .
it is n't chicago and it is n't the suburbs .
i 'm still here , so obviously i love it .
go .
hail to the orange hail to the blue hail alma mater ever so true ... ( so truuuuueeeee ) we love no other so let our motto be : `` victory , illinois ( sssssss ) , var-si-ty ! ''
ill-ini - illini til i die !
let 's take a cornfield and build two cities in it .
now let 's take these cities and drop a university right where they intersect .
oh wait , someone already did that .
it 's called the university of illinois at urbana champaign .
but only if you look .
enjoy your time , do n't waste it away complaining or being afraid .
go to one of each type of sports event at least once .
play frisbee or sunbathe on the quad at least once .
use a fake id at least once .
do n't waste it , its over before you know .
i 'm a fan .
no better way to be surrounded by so many different people .
uic has an average age of _ num _ and much higher diversity rates .
that and it is in my wonderful city of chicago .
what university is n't this way ?
but you do have to want to .
you have to work for it .
it 's not dropped in your lap .
the diversity is out there .
but it 's there .
the classes here are top notch .
but it 's not so much what i actually learned in class .
i am a very proud alumna .
go illini !
i only wish that i had decided to go there in the first place .
this is a great academic institution .
i love it here .
this is classic college at its finest .
as a lower classman , your classes are large and very tough .
they are unofficially called weed courses .
they ensure that the strong students continue and succeed .
this is a very large university .
illinois has a large international student population , making it incredibly diverse .
illinois has also been a pioneer in handicap accessibility since the 1970s .
the opportunities here are amazing and available to everyone .
large universities are not for everyone .
regardless , it 's still one of the best in higher education .
it 's gigantic , yet full of personality and character .
it 's daunting , but not insurmountable .
i 'm thankful for that .
there 's a strong organizing tradition here .
people * care * about things , and it 's nice to see .
campus is very spread out .
we love no other so let our motto be victory , illinoisssssssssssssss !
long live the chief !
the only good thing about champaign is the school itself .
there are a bunch of interesting characters and plenty to do .
the school offers a variety of classes to produce well rounded and worldly graduates .
there are resources to help with interviewing skills , resumes , and job connection .
there is nothing like supporting your school and bleeding orange and blue .
it is the quintessential college experience !
one of the greatest research institutions that exists .
i-n-i i am so proud to call this place my alma mater .
socially , this place is a mess .
i highly recommend roland realty .
other than that , there are some aspects i will miss .
they are that friendly .
need a permit or a document ?
go to office a .
office a tells you to go to office b .
for us , there are n't any other colleges .
i l l i n i what 's up with that ?
is homecoming segregated ?
is discrimination a problem at u of i ?
ignore the haters .
join a student organization , or better yet , start one .
find some ethnic cuisine you 've never tried before .
skip the campus bars every now and then and try out downtown champaign .
pull an all-nighter in the ugl .
go to your professor 's office hours for a change .
pick up some b movies at that 's rentertainment .
play intramural sports .
get a job at a dorm dining hall and make lifelong friends .
watch some kids play dance dance revolution extremely well in the illini union .
read a book of poems on the quad .
i 'm not a frat bro .
things do not change over time .
very pretty view and lots of stores , restaurants , bars ... good combination of academic and party life .
i 'm writing this review as a uiuc graduate .
positives : - the campus is really beautiful and generally visually appealing .
the architecture is fantastic .
as you walk around campus , it feels quintessential .
it 's especially college-looking in the fall .
( you know , like all the brochures that get sent out . )
- you are only required to live on campus freshmen year .
it 's much cheaper than on-campus housing with a meal plan .
it 's the midwest .
people are friendly .
it 's a small world for such a big school .
- we host some pretty epic events here .
i do n't think i need to say anything more about that .
- your education is whatever you make of it .
other people slide by and only go to class when there 's an exam .
negatives : - this school is expensive .
- greek life can somewhat overwhelm the social scene at times .
- urbana/champaign has nothing going for it except for the university .
everything in the area caters to college students .
no wonder drinking is so big here .
sometimes there is n't much else to do .
- a lot of lab/research opportunities are for graduate students only .
now the great professors are retiring .
the last ten years have been a nightmare of mismanagement .
but for now , there are many great universities to attend in the us .
some neighboring states offer in state tuition to illinois residents .
if you want to party hardy , illinois is the place to go .
steer clear of the college of media entirely .
amidst all the financial scandals , the lincoln theater does look quite impressive .
the little courtyards house the bricks bearing names of the donations .
the university of illinois is really moving upwards and always trying to improve itself .
i know if my brother attends he will be in private housing .
i just do n't think we got the best first impression .
favorite place on campus to see a performance !
this place is definitely three steps up from the typical university art museum .
i am so glad we did !
do n't miss it !
there 's a great one about baggage right now .
that 's how you tempt folks into gettin ' a little culture .
check it out next time you are in c-u .
the east wing is haunted .
nice university museum but certainly not the best i have seen .
you definitely get your money 's worth with her large beautiful arrangements .
april 's is my go-to place for flowers .
april 's has consistently delivered great arrangements and smiles !
meat quality tends to be iffy .
this is the place to go for cheap chinese food in campustown .
my personal favorite is their spicy fish filet .
what the heck is some of the best chinese cuisine anywhere doing in champaign ?
they make other dumpling/potsticker selections look pretty pathetic by comparison in size and flavor .
my preferred place to eat chinese on campus .
their general tso 's chicken is amazing .
unless you 're sharing it with someone else .
i doubt i can be completely objective ; i love the place too much .
i mean , i 've watched the family 's kids grow up !
i recommend the general tso 's chicken .
the flavor of the sauce is amazing and the consistency of the chicken excellent .
sit by the window and watch the campus walk by below ... great location .
best general tso 's chicken i have ever had , and i 'm chinese .
but man , is it spicy !
one of the best fast-food chinese places i 've ever eaten at .
definitely go here when you have the hankering for chinese .
never ordering from this place again .
the campus chinese place to go is lai-lai , period .
empire is cheap , super fast , and generally satisfying .
dishes may be slightly greasy , but they 're tasty as hell .
even for a cheap chinese place the atmo leaves much to be desired .
and i 'm not at all fussy about that .
the food is delicious and the portions are well worth it .
now that 's what i call mediocre !
i 'm not a snob when it comes to chinese food at all .
my previous experiences at empire have been pretty good .
it 's still a good amount of food for the money .
i do n't usually review boring chinese places , but well here i am .
empire is my go-to place for cheap chinese food .
the food is good enough and the price is low .
i really love this family-owned/ran business .
i love the general 's or orange chicken .
$ _ num _ gets you _ num _ .
complete steal .
empire also finally takes cc 's , but there 's lame $ _ num _ min .
this is my favorite place to eat chinese food on campus .
that dish is amazing .
but boy am i glad we tried it .
empire is cheap .
each time we order delivery it lasts at least _ num _ meals .
in general , the chinese menu items ( house specialty/szechuan ) have been awesome .
the portion is always huge and i bring home leftovers .
they also offer free hot tea and water during your meal .
i really wish i had this place nearby , i miss it .
their food is amazing , best chinese food i 've had hands down .
i think it 's safe to say i 'm never going back .
but they do serve congee !
food seems decent overall and portions are priced well .
i highly recommend the hunan pork and pork egg foo yong .
the free tea is great as well !
environment is quiet crowded and messy .
never want to try again it is good for different dishes have different feeling .
there 's nothing really special besides the free tea .
the place is kinda dumpy but i like the food ... this is one of the only places on campus that i 'd get chinese .
the taste is good , too , maybe not the best but indeed good .
a little excessive on the starbuck 's bashing though ... hoorah pretention !
to both kill ... and die for .
however , the bathroom is terrifyingly small .
that is a problem .
even the bagels are great .
: ) this is my daily coffee stop .
and oh my gosh , did i mention the oatmeal raisin cookies ?
ahhhhhh no wonder people here are so round .
it 's like a sunday evening and there 's seriously no one here .
it 's not busy .
there 's no line .
it 's not like i took a long time deciding what i wanted .
i 'm like a regular too .
coming here about 5x / week .
ugh i 'm so mad really , the worst of the espresso locations on campus .
second of all , the coffee is nearly always burnt .
how hard is it to brew a cup .
listen .
it balances things out .
foam the milk , do n't scorch it .
it 's supposed to be foamy not watery .
no , coffee is not supposed to taste like burnt acid .
i guess that 's your way of being funny too ?
it 's still not balancing out .
the flavor is very robust and espresso tends toward a darker roast .
favorite to drink : hazelnut americano .
there 's something about the way they prepare drinks that really works for me .
i 'm sure i 'll be back at least once a leep weekend .
the obvious choice for gslis students and staff ; we 're heavily caffeinated .
good place to grab some coffee between classes .
the drinks are almost always tasty and the food is pretty good .
i like the chicken salad sandwich , which has cranberries in it .
i 'm not sure why it took me so long to frequent this place .
there is plenty of seating between the upstairs and the downstairs .
love to get coffee here whenever i 'm in champaign !
it sells coffee and iced tea .
it 's drinkable .
the lemon bars are good .
at least it 's not another starbucks ?
the coffee here is atrocious .
but i still have a 10-oz .
always grabbed sth in the afternoon before i go to class third strike , you 're out !
i 've given this place three opportunities to _ num _ .
provide service with a smile and not an attitude .
provide a drink that i could actually swallow .
bring the mop !
it taste good .
as for the coffee ... i do n't know what to say .
it 's caffeinated .
other than ... i avoid getting the espresso drinks ( cappuccinos , lattes , etc . )
the drink craftsmanship is nil .
the matcha latte ... it 's just milk , dude .
it 's milk .
it 's not a matcha latte .
it 's milk .
all of their mixed drinks are milk .
the drinks , like everything else there , are overpriced for their quality .
i recommend the cold press .
this place is as expensive as starbucks coffee .
the only difference is at espresso royal , you get a lower quality cup .
with the starbucks right down the street it is not worth going here .
the only day worth visiting is on wednesday because they have one dollar lattes .
the seating is pretty cramped .
i have no complaints about the staff .
they have been very friendly .
i 've never had a problem with service here and love the drinks .
the food is mediocre cafe food , but that 's how the all are !
i go here instead of the slightly closer to my office starbucks every time .
i have no complaints about the management .
lofts _ num _ terrible !
yes , that 's right even worse that cpm .
lived at lofts _ num _ for a year .
we have had a very positive experience with roland ; more specifically with kurt .
i live in one of roland 's smaller buildings in champaign .
they are the best landlord i 've ever had .
you can pay the rent online and submit work orders online .
the office guys are very nice and helpful .
appointments are taken ( not necesary ) because the wait is never too long .
manicures are only $ _ num _ and pedicures $ _ num _ .
english is spoken here also .
i have to echo what elizabeth t. said about this place !
it is literally the only nail salon open on sunday afternoon in champaign !
this is nicely added touch as it made the hour or so fly by !
definitely worth checking out if you 're in town !
both times i 've gone the salon has been packed .
i get lots of compliments on how great my toes look .
they do a nice job and listen to what you want .
i recommend bringing your own flip flops or whatever .
i think i may be getting my nails done on a regular basis now !
it is unlikely i 'll return in the future .
not a bad spot to get a quick and cheap manicure .
it 's not a fancy place but the staff are very nice and efficient .
it 's very inexpensive .
i think _ num _ for a basic manicure .
they also have no chip and other services .
close to campus and all nail techs have tons of experience .
the prices are very reasonable .
there 's no organization and it is just ridiculous !
after using the tools they 've just returned tools to this dirty mug .
they do not clean their own furniture and floor .
disgusting .
this is very strange for me .
my nails are all shapes and sizes , none remotely straight .
i am currently walking home to redo my nails .
the prices are okay .
thanks tao : ) these + ladies do an excellent job on my eyebrows every time !
they totally deserve it .
they do a fantastic job on nails too !
i seriously love this place .
i have n't been to this bergners in a very long time .
i like this store but their female help in the upstairs needs improvement .
tell marnetta to bring more of the cute girls from downstairs up there !
need that to round out the `` upscale '' shopping experience .
* update * see rachel 's review several months after mine .
wadya know .
she also has experienced the fine service of local proleteriat women .
it 's a piece of junk .
the only thing you can use this worthless coupon on is their junk .
like those stupid little thoughtless gifts they offer this time of year .
who needs that ?
i find at least something to buy there most of the time .
they have `` saved '' so much money using them .
and they come once a month .
selection is ok and they have a good amount of petites .
service is hit or miss .
store review : otherwise the clothing selection is above average .
they have a home good section as well on the more expensive side .
pros : department store variety cons : smaller store , coupons are hard to use hidden deals : sign up for the email club for special coupon savings slightly target older people .
have some sophisticated brands like calvin klein or columbus .
they are by appointment only .
~ ~ ~ never do business here .
~ ~ ~ allow me to elaborate .
needless to say , this business ranks among the most poorly run in town .
good news for them is their survival seems secured by a lack of competition .
all in all , i have no qualms about returning for equipment rentals .
also , they tend to be slammed fri-sun , so be prepared to wait .
this is absolutely obsurd customer service .
this place is awful !
the employees are either dumb or just do n't give a shit .
they 're unorganized and totally clueless .
i have never used a business so poorly run .
or maybe they 're all this bad .
no that 's not a typo .
on the flip side , all the trucks seem to be well-maintained .
that 's the only flip side .
review -- - u-haul on university , words can not express how much u-suck .
it 's okay , calm down .
there 's only five people in front of you .
gray is fine .
i love gray ... just not dusty gray .
not it 's - sucking-the-life-out-of-you gray .
legends say that he is still waiting in line at the store today .
maybe he 's having trouble finding the key to my truck ?
okay now i 'm getting mad .
where is he ?
i walk back into the store to see him exactly where i left him .
at the desk helping another customer .
keys are already inside . ''
i am a regular renter at the u-haul on university avenue .
in fact , i usually rent anywhere from 2-5 times per year .
in fact , things have always been above and beyond great .
this location is weird .
their customer service is terrible .
this is unacceptable .
this place needs at least two more employees , and better customer service .
have rented an open trailer here on occasion to move things within town .
it 's fine but such a hassle for a $ _ num _ rental .
it ends up costing me around _ num _ minutes .
i can rent a $ 20,000 new car with much less hassle .
with some direction and resources provided from management , the locationwould immensely improve .
we arrive here at 12:00 pm just to return the car .
and oh my god , it tastes soo good .
the equation for the tastiness goes something like this ... y = t * x ^ 2 where t is a function of how late it is , y is the yum factor , double 11-in .
sub special is their best offer .
also , i can get a dill pickle instead of chips .
their sandwiches are pretty big too and they do n't skimp on the meat .
it 's a step up from jimmy john 's and subway for sure .
other locations do much better than this one , it 's a shame really .
drivers are friendly .
it 's better than subway , and more expensive too .
the sandwich selection is great .
the only downside is the wait time .
when it is slow it can take _ num _ minutes plus to get a sandwich .
it seems they are severely understaffed .
poor silver mine subs being right next to subway .
also , there 's free wifi here .
all sandwich stores taste the same with me .
just had their delivery at my job and their steak sandwich is pretty good .
that 's not what i got .
i 've had the comstock before and it 's decent .
the dodge city also was n't bad either .
my absolute fav shot is the *** t-bomb *** !
it 's ciclon and red bull .
i 've been looking for it in chicago , but no bars carry ciclon !
do not try to go here at _ num _ in the morning .
two levels , so you can sit upstairs and watch the crowd from above .
decent music and great wings ( i think they still have wing night ) .
long lines after _ num _ am .
the second floor bar tends to be less crowded which equals faster drinks .
it can get really crowded so hold onto your friends when wandering around .
basically just a sports bar with enough room for people to dance as well .
other than that though , it 's pretty fun .
's , and they have pretty good specials here .
the decor is bar-ish .
drink selection is decent .
girls are pretty dressed up , guys notsomuch .
i 'd never wait in line or pay cover to get inside though ... brothers : it 's your run of the mill college bar .
cheap drinks good music crazy dancing one of your few redeeming qualities is that you have bass on tap .
i still believe this , even though i seriously have no idea why .
another ` older ' crowd bar since it 's no cover for 21 + .
watch the stairs though !
i do n't know how much it has changed since i loathed this place .
large airy bar that seems to be a great place to catch a game .
not as good as the iowa location , but worth checking out .
friendly bartenders that recommend new and exciting brews/drinks even when the place is crowded .
it 's hard not to love a place with that kind of attitude !
hate this bar .
the only good time to go is when it 's nearly empty .
i do n't get why people go here just for the wings .
i 've had good times at brothers .
i 've had bad times at brothers .
it gets too crowded to play darts .
past 11 pm the bathroom resembles a slip and slide .
it seems to be totally random .
the bathroom is completely and absolutely unusable .
never wasting my time at brother 's again .
my ears hurt more than anywhere else i 've been .
disgusting .
there 's no air circulation whatsoever .
the fans on the ceiling are useless .
go elsewhere !
more like a sports bar and super crowded and not really relaxing .
have no place to stand or sit .
i like the lofted floor plan here .
beer selection is quite good .
way better than brothers in iowa city , i can tell you that much .
also sometimes their music is just kind of weird .
if you want somewhere to go and dance , this is definitely not it .
i have a sweet spot for gameday .
they have a good selection , but wow is this stuff expensive .
they have fitting rooms , which is good .
not much else to say !
and the quad shop is now a jamba juice .
which i 'm not ok with .
it 's even fairly inexpensive to book .
get your nap on , kids .
that place is buzzing with activity and young folks with laptops everywhere .
the entrance hall is very relaxing with ancient looking clock and couches .
illinois ' union building is okay ... landmark review : oh this place brings back so many memories , so many nooks and crannies .
there is a lot of hidden stuff here that is great .
let me highlight some great finds _ num _ .
bowling alley , arcade , billiards , xbox rental in the basement _ num _ .
lots of restaurants downstairs to eat at and some snack/coffee shops on the first floor _ num _ .
there is the illini union ballroom which serves ayce lunch _ num _ .
a lot of professors stop here for lunch _ num _ .
free supplies twice per semester cold pack pregnancy test yeast infection kit wound pack every two weeks condom pack lubricant or spermicidal gel latex barriers _ num _ .
illini book store for all your illini gear/book needs _ num _ .
tech zone - they can help repair your computer _ num _ .
document services - if you need help printing brochures , flyers etc _ num _ .
great for naps , reading , or a place to rest in between test .
need a quiet space ?
need to have a meeting set up with your other student organization members ?
go up to the second floor in the rso office .
do n't have time to go back home and make lunch ?
need to checkout some tech goodies that are vital to your studies/work ?
that 's right !
definitely check it out !
this place looks really classy inside .
the illinois student senate office is located here as well as their meetings .
daily illini - has gotten better recently , but its a crap paper altogether .
the stories are poorly written and usually cite facebook as reference .
also , the dj 's are inept .
the buzz - only reason this is getting _ num _ stars .
i 've experienced better student run publications .
guess what happened ?
any sensible human being would have acted differently .
please avoid this company at all costs .
i have had experience with much more helpful companies in the urbana-champaign area .
if they tow you , you are pissed .
this place is absolutely terrible .
on top of that these people are condescending assholes .
do not use these people , they are terrible .
but they still serve orange chicken .
this is the best chinese in campus-town .
i recommend the crispy tofu .
the menu has so many varieties of foods .
very inexpensive and i highly recommend it !
never again stay away from this place !
think oily , but good oily !
come for good food , but do n't expect any service .
i 've never experienced this type of service before - or lack there of .
my favorite thing for dim sum is shrimp crepes and turnip cake .
around $ _ num _ to share _ num _ dishes .
but now it 's barely passable .
prices are n't bad either , about the usual prices for dim sum .
but that 's just a testament to the ownership and the so-so food .
if you want dim sum you can always go to saigon .
i do n't live in champaign anymore but i come back to eat here .
their spicy pig intestine stew is probably the best dish i have ever eaten .
every time i go , i take an order with me .
i am glad i can still get it for _ num _ .
it 's always fun to come here with a big group . )
mandarin wok reminds me of the chinese restaurants back home .
the tea , jasmine or chrysanthemum , is free .
with giant round table w / lazy susans , this place is perfect for groups .
the atmosphere is as good as the service -- somewhat non-existent .
_ num _ ) sesame rolls - awesome !
far exceeding the likes of legitimate vietnamese establishments in the champaign-urbana area .
and they even bring the bean sprouts , herbs , and jalapeno slices .
but i am fine with that .
be wary of when you order though .
but the portions are fairly priced so that 's a plus .
their dim sum is delicious !
not only is it delicious , they have dim sum 11am-3pm every day !
who does that !
it 's amazing !
forget rainbow garden - come here for real chinese food .
in my opinion , that is way too long for an hour lunch break .
i do not think that i 'll ever be returning .
food is good , only gave _ num _ stars because of wait time .
then the shui mai comes out -- - same thing , wow ?
the dim sum here is delicious !
definitely recommend the dim sum .
they serve it every day from 11am-3pm !
how have i not reviewed mandarin wok yet ?
the fried tofu is so good here .
the regular dinner menu is huge and the food is good .
dishes come out with pretty decent portions .
to me , that 's always a win .
so far the only on campus i know that have dim sum .
owner lady is extremely nice .
dim sum is available .
the only concern is the unsanitary look .
the food is all right .
chinese cuisine ai n't american fried shit .
trying to make everything always end up failing at everything .
the food is good though .
alright , i 'm back to not liking the dim sum here ... .
i question the health code standards here ... .
this is a very good place for authentic southern chinese food on campus .
even my parents ( they are chinese ) like this place .
it 's so good and absolutely authentic .
i guess this is predictable because of the inflation and increase in cost .
this is also the only place serving dim sum in champaign as of today .
the food is oily and lacks flavor .
overall , i feel like i really wasted my money here .
this place is a total rip off .
they overcharge you everything and hope you will never notice .
the lady doesnt really act nice to us cause we arent chinese ... the deep fried taro smells like straight up clorox and i was scared .
dont think ill come back here .
this place is filthy .
this is just a review of the facility .
the christie facility is well-designed , in a good location , and well-staffed .
mtd gets you there easily , too .
they make it ( ahem ) as painless as possible .
you are not alone , after typing that last one i hate myself too .
take care of biz w / your doc and you 're off .
my primary is here too and no hassles there either .
`` building wealth '' is a frickin pillar of their values .
i hate them .
i drink my coffee black .
this is a horrible place .
even after they have already known you are healthy .
she is so bad that i get anxiety talking to her .
she makes mistakes , she shows her ego , and she does not care .
i pray you do not get her .
please fix .
i am so done with christie clinic .
they do n't know how to bill correctly !
another issue i had is for another annual exam .
christie clinic uses diagnosis codes for what they are trying to rule out .
better yet , just find a different healthcare facility to go to !
they suck .
for the last year and a half , my experience goes like this .
get cancelled and rescheduled 3-5 times .
doc changes my scripts , i call the pharmcy who never got them .
avoid going here at any cost !
very rude and unhelpful staff when it comes to complaints !
just save yourself lots of follow-up problems with billing and go to another place !
they are friendly and professional and dr z .
is very knowledgeable .
i highly recommend he and his staff .
they really get you in & out of there quick !
it 's always extremely rowdy , probably too rowdy for me these days .
yes , it 's dirty .
yes , it 's smelly .
college binge drinking at it 's finest .
not that that is necesarrily a good thing .
not so great at night when the typical crowd gets there .
just for the location ( across from thetas ) , you get 5stars .
the vomit smell is even there at like 8 am on tuesday mornings !
they 're right - kam 's blows .
it deserves zero stars .
you know how you can pin point freshman when they come to the uiuc ?
they 're toting around bright orange illini union bookstore bags .
same goes to the people who wait in line at kam 's .
the majority are freshman .
screw that .
look !
or maybe that was just me , i can never be sure .
kam 's is definitely an under age paradise .
who are you people giving these stupid reviews ?
do they ever mop ?
just get some toilet paper in the ladies room stalls !
this place is a nightmare .
there is nothing redeeming about this place .
the music is really really shit , not even ironic shit but honestly shit .
the only time i 'm ever here is during a bar crawl .
ever wonder why you ca n't get laid ?
because you are a nerd are you a sensible , intelligent human being ?
are you older than _ num _ ?
does your clothing generally obscure your breasts/underwear/genitals from plain sight ?
are you averse to fist-pumping ?
does the pungent odor of beer-tinged vomit make you nauseous ?
like everyone else said , wasted freshmen , disgusting bathrooms , bad smells .
ladies ... pass this one up .
you can do better !
kams is always filled with student athletes with the throngs of girls surrounding them .
someone needs to mop it every once in awhile .
kam 's is one of the best bars in the world .
the basement is fantastic for parties and the staff is very knowledgeable .
the free popcorn is of gourmet quality .
( obviously i am a beer connoisseur . )
that 's saying something .
smells like a hamster cage in serious need of a bedding change .
drinks are totally average , albeit cheap .
the two stars are because the floors had many sticky diseases on it .
do n't they clean the floors ?
just walk by the place and be overwhelmed by the smell .
i 've been in the place once and it is gross .
this is n't just an `` i hate frats '' thing or something either .
note : this review only applies to august _ num _ - may _ num _ .
( this review also applies to the lesser-known koms ) this bar stinks !
this is the stinkiest , slimiest , stickiest bar i 've ever been to .
worst bar i 've been to , period .
the smell , what is it ?
this bar is the scummiest fucking shithole at uofi .
the answer to good for kids should be are you kidding .
went there to party , fun , but the establishment itself sucks .
dont go here until someone buys it again its really a piece of shit what an absolute dump .
everyone who goes to kams is underage .
more likely to see a high schooler in kams than a 21 + individual .
one star is too much .
i have n't been to kams since i went to college .
kams is the empyrean of champaign life .
five dollar cover ?
are you joking ?
leading psychologists say that smells ring bells * .
it is tasty and good and sweet to the tongue .
it dulls all the bad senses and electrifies the good ones .
it instills confidence where there was none , and reinvigorates the soul .
one suggestion is to start serving food .
a blue boy sandwich , now that is something .
* https : / / www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-babble/201501/smells-ring-bells-how-smell-triggers-memories-and-emotions frat boy douchebag feel .
there 's a strong smell of vomit throughout the bar .
writing this review is making me miss tis and college ... .
bookstore , but lately i am so far from a fan .
is almost always the cheapest of the three stores .
however , i can usually find all my books for much cheaper on amazon.com .
but cheap when they sell means cheap when they buy back ... for each dollar you spend , you earn a point .
after earning certain amount of points , you qualify for different prizes .
if ever i need something for a class , i 've always preferred tis .
if you get any gunk on the pages they do n't buy it .
they do n't buy it .
class does n't use it anymore ?
i recommend buying online from amazon prime or abebooks.com first .
i wish i could give _ num _ stars .
the grocery has staples like plain old salt mixed in with mexican imports .
the produce sections has avocados for all your guacamole-making needs .
gracias a dios que hay una restaurante semiautentico en champaign !
the tamales are smallish but yummy .
go to el charro and eat real mexican food .
this place is amazing !
you have not tasted carnitas until you have tried theirs .
and even the tongue here is amazing .
make sure you wash it down with a jarrito ... preferably tamarind .
trust these west coast people , they know their stuff !
treat him right and he 'll take really good care of you .
his ingredients are much fresher than what i can get ... no fair .
as much as i like it , chipotle does n't count .
it 's a pretty easy place to miss .
he really deserves a medal for the effort .
for being in illinois , nothing else outside of chicago can compare .
the grocery store and food counter are unassuming and homey ( homely ? )
everything is super cheap for the quality and quantity .
it 's a non-corporate family venture , the same folks are always working .
if it looks good , and smells tasty , just eat !
alejandro is really friendly , and he 's kinda super hot as well .
this is the real deal .
the price is n't too bad at the grocery store at all .
he 's super nice and friendly .
nom nom nom nom nom this is what happened to the tamales i bought from el charro .
no frills , but that 's not what you go here for .
the owner is as friendly as they come .
this little taqueria reminds me of the ones back in chicago .
a hole in the wall but the food definitely makes up for it .
i recommend the lengua with their homemade hot sauce .
i 've kept for a secret long enough .
i always get the tacos with a jarrito .
the point is , the food here is really good .
everything seems really fresh , and the guy working there is always really friendly .
but do n't let the shadiness scare you away !
so if you like maize , definitely give el charro a chance !
for its size , el charro packs a punch .
i 've formerly only eaten in the restaurant here , which was always tasty .
i hope he reads this & rectifies the problem .
steak milanesa sandwich is so good !
the menudo is like grandmas .
the taco and burritos are really good too !
i 'm a regular .
i like maize , too , but i prefer el charro .
if you want a authentic food this is definitely the place to try .
usually that may mean good traditional food .
the carne asada is usually very tender the way it was prepared .
the problem is that it was thinly sliced so it was quite over cooked .
i 'm shocked that they have _ num _ stars .
i like el charro a lot actually .
maize is a little better but the salsa at el charro is bomb .
the tortilla chips are better here too .
i am a fan of their tacos and rice/beans .
they give you a more generous portion .
i do n't think i 'll be heading back here .
tortillas/tacos are delicious !
salsa and chips are really good .
$ _ num _ taco wednesdays _ num _ .
sauces that come with the tacos .
reminds me of king taco in los angeles .
service can be slow .
takes some time getting things such as water , straw , fork , etc .
or maybe i 'm just a needy customer .
mexican music can get loud .
it 's a small grocery store & eatery .
the tacos always hit the spot .
pozole ( pork & hominy soup ) on the weekends is a special treat .
i like mine with plenty of lime & cilantro .
horchatas are huge & there are refills .
the storefront & the interior are small and not necessarily clean looking .
but the food is fantastic & alejandro is super nice .
there are a few tables/chairs if you want to eat in .
the tv is usually on quite loud .
let me say , i strongly regret this decision .
spend the extra few dollars and go to maize .
slowest service i 've ever had .
avoid !
the cook and waiters are nice .
the prices are good .
every time i eat here i order carne asada tacos & chips and salsa .
they 're understaffed though .
this place is great .
also the food is cheap !
i highly recommend el charro , steak tacos are great .
specifically on wednesday when they have their dollar tacos special .
the beef , chicken and pastor tacos are each a dollar every wednesday .
they are extremely flavorful .
the beef tacos are n't bad either , but i prefer the pastor tacos .
competitor of kam 's , which is right next door .
i love uiuc .
take a friend in case there 's no door .
for one , the name of this bar is `` c.o .
daniel '' - which stands for cochrane on daniel .
it 's a cochrane bar - imagine that .
it is affectionately known as `` c.o .
's '' or `` see ho 's '' .
co 's is slightly classier than kam 's and has a slightly older crowd .
they definitely get the job done .
honestly , it 's a typical college bar .
i still remember many faces but sadly , very few names .
enjoy your time there ... i 'd give anything to have it back !
: - ) lots of choices that are made to order .
my favorite is the chicken cesar pita .
delivery takes a little while , so it 's best to pick up .
it 's open late ... i think until 3ish .
this is my favorite place to eat in champaign-urbana .
i hope they bring one to my home-town !
this place is over-rated .
dorcas is one of the best korean restaurant in cu in my opinion .
i love their combos because i always get to try different dishes .
my favorite is their grilled mackerel .
they give you tonnes of food as you can see from the pictures .
update : i retract my last statement .
you get very sizeable portions .
i love this place !
dorcas is a very standard korean restaurant ... that koreans actually go to !
the interior is clearly not meant for show , and while you know what ?
it makes the food stand out even better !
go to april 's .
for more details keep reading .
nothing on their window , their door , or online to indicate this .
very disappointing considering their job is flowers and the flowers they have are terrible .
also the flowers are listed so you know what you are getting .
it is your classic walgreen .
the people working there are very cool and they help y a lot !
clean , well lit , it 's a walgreens .
great greek food including awesome gyros !
this place gets busy as lunch because it 's right by the quad !
go on tuesdays for discount prices .
at least i have many more tuesdays ahead to take advantage !
the gyros here are decent and they have live music on certain days .
expect to pay a cover for the music .
i love the gyros here .
i love their cucumber sauce even more : ) cool place for lunch on campus ... their fries are great !
gyros , fries , and drinks to go .
this is where i spend _ num _ minutes every tuesday night .
service is fast and it 's not usually too crowded .
it does have its location going for it , though .
what to say about it ... service is always great .
the people that work there always seem happy and treat you well .
prices are totally reasonable .
never eat here before a test .
i miss this place wish there was one in chicago .
they also have killians on tap and a fairly large bottle selection .
zorba 's is probably my favorite green street eatery .
i usually eat healthy , well-balanced meals .
however , i occasionally indulge with something less health-friendly .
when i indulge , i go to zorba 's .
a zorba 's gyro is heaven for the tastebuds .
but zorba 's is here to help you with portion control !
i like how they offer their gyros in _ num _ different sizes .
oh , and try the cucumber sauce .
ah zorba 's , makes me feel young again .
yum their gyros are some of the best .
i like that they have different sizes of gyros .
pass on the spinach pie though , it 's not very good .
yum their cucumber sauce is awesome .
they also have a wonderful honey dijon for the chicken gyros .
good food and i love all the dipping sauces .
best gyro i 've had on campus .
i miss you zorba 's !
the food is relatively good .
the fries are the best .
it 's an ok restaurant , check it out !
i 've been happy with both kinds of gyros .
now , i only wish there were a zorba 's in my college town .
fries are good as well , overall great experience .
this is my favorite place to eat on green street .
this place is fantastic .
everything from their gyros to hummus to fries are all on point .
i absolultely love gyros so this is a no-brainer for me .
i feel like this place is a staple of quick , delicious campus food .
not to mention the gyros are bomb .
go if you have n't already !
everything it does , niro 's gyros does both better and cheaper .
so maybe i am not the target audience .
but the thing is , i love gyros !
the ones at zorba 's are comparatively small .
the problem is that the meat is not very good .
it has kind of a gritty texture and an off flavor .
it reminds me of the frozen gyro meat you can get at grocery stores .
decor is old-fashioned as fits a local institution .
there is sort of a grease-haze that hangs in the air .
but here 's to hoping !
i wish them a speedy recovery .
i 'll be back for the holidays and hope they have re-opened by then .
the whole family enjoy the food .
it 's the only place my dad will eat fries .
the gyros on the other hand are !
we get the lamb ones .
the food is consistent good and served quickly .
and i love the illini memorabilia .
parking is an issue as they have no dedicated lot .
otherwise , be very patient with finding parking - especially during lunch time .
zorba 's has re-opened !
brand new interior ( looks nice ! )
the food is n't bad ; i 've just had better .
welcome back zorbas !
not the best i 've ever had , but easily the best in town .
i 'm sorry we waited , the food in the shop is even better !
have only been there once but was a big fan of the gyros .
i 'm so happy they re-opened after the fire .
i 've been a customer for _ num _ years i have gone with the gyros both times and have not been disappointed .
the food is delicious and the prices are very reasonable .
pass up the chains and go to zorba 's .
take it from an illini - you wo n't be disappointed .
zorbas is amazing and an important part of my uiuc experience !
a great place for gryos , their cucumber sauce is the best !
i have a gyro or two every time i 'm back in champaign .
this place has always been a favorite of mine .
i 'm so glad they came back after the fire , better than ever .
i especially like that they offer a small size of their gyros sandwich .
they have excellent fries as well .
service is always fast and friendly .
keep up the good work !
zorba 's is still my favorite gyro place of all time .
the food is delicious and they have some pretty unique sauces .
the meat is always tender and flavorful , never dry or bland .
check them out !
i always stop by for a bite when i 'm back in town .
it 's pretty good .
i 'm never unhappy at zorba 's .
check their daily specials before you go in some of them are great .
the fact that you can order a small , medium .
brilliantly seasoned too , the meat is definitely what sets these gyros apart .
the place has a nice , local college hotspot feel .
this is simply one of my favorite spots in town .
they say that consistency is the hallmark of excellence .
i also prefer subbing in onion rings or fried mushrooms for fries .
the gyros are authentic and the santiki ( ? )
sauce is second to none .
greek salads are another highlight .
gyros are soooo tasty , i keep coming back for more .
price is okay and service is fast .
seriously try their gyros .
their tzatziki sauce is still my favorite , and the chili is delicious .
i almost want to binge drink so i can eat here the next day .
the salad does n't have enough cheese !
the store is right on green street and impossible to miss walking by .
inside is pretty cool , open style kitchen and lots of indoor seating .
restaurant review : there are daily specials which is posted on the sign outside .
other than that the combos are about 7-8 dollars a pop .
this is where it falls short .
the fries that come with the combo is a very small portion .
additionally , they are quite stingy with the meat , i.e .
they actually weigh and measure how much gyro meat you are getting .
but who knows .
pro : fast service , self service no need to tip hidden gem : _ num _ .
you can use the belly card to earn points toward free items _ num _ .
daily specials tuesday - _ num _ dollar of gyro and 1/2 price fries , _ num _ dollar off veggie sandwiches wednesday - 1/4 lb beef hot dog , fries , and pepsi _ num _ dollars thursday - bbq pulled pork , fries , pepsi _ num _ dollars friday - fish sandwich , fries , pepsi _ num _ not a bad lunch spot .
cool that they do jazz on some nights .
zorba 's has the best gyros , hands-down .
so glad that they rebuilt !
coming back in july , zorba 's !
location is great .
this place is a u of i must-eat !
just stick with a gyros sandwich ( the fries are mediocre ) .
you like gyros ?
you like fresh fries ?
you like green street ?
the meat is always juicey and the fries always salty .
love the food at atmosphere .
and they keep that line moving .
they do n't have beer anymore which has helped university productivity .
this is some incredibly tasty and greasy food .
the biggest pro - they have a tzatziki dispenser !
the price is great , you can eat here for just about $ _ num _ .
this is a good place to stop by for some quick and tasty food .
it is near campus , which is convenient for students .
this is incredibly dishonest and ungrateful .
moreover , it 's a sign of pure laziness by the owners .
the food is always nothing short of excellent .
it is a staple , and a local landmark .
long live !
now ... where am i going to put all this food ?
this is a staple in campus town for good reason .
check them out if you 're in the mood for a gyro .
i have to admit i liked garcia 's pizza .
it 's all about the crust which has an amazing flavor !
i just get cheese pizza here the crust needs little to dress it up .
i 've in fact driven _ num _ miles just to get this pizza .
garcia 's have the best pizza outside of chicago .
this place is horrible .
the service is very rude .
well here we go .
go fightin ' illini and thank you te ` shurt !
so i 'm not the target audience here .
but they are one of the few places left to get chief apparel .
chief apparel of any sort is enough to make me a fan .
the service i have received from te shurt has been great .
that 's life for ya .
i 'm not sure why i never came here as a student .
the selection is smaller and the best thing is the donuts with creme fraiche .
cafe luna is lovely at lunch time , with tapas at dinner .
there 's patio seating in nice weather , and an intimate dining room otherwise .
it 's nice to know that you can find fine dining in champaign .
it is the best tapas place that i have ever experienced .
i really want to drive back down to have it some more ... .
it is a classy , delicious , fine-dining tapas establishment .
the food is great ... read on for more of that later ... we consider ourselves patient , but this service was very weird .
plan to spend $ 50-75 for two people .
well ... luna still falls seriously short for me .
how do you not notice that ?
how do you screw up your special ?
sorry luna , after two attempts now , i 'm not coming back .
with that said , i like the lighting .
the silky pillows that match the walls do not work .
cafe luna just needs more polish on their food and better trained waiters .
i hate to say it , but luna is pretty overrated .
as others have noted , the goat cheese balls are fantastic .
this is the old standby for romantic dinners with my husband .
it 's a wonderful experience going there and it wo n't totally bankrupt you .
their wines are always amazing .
i 'm one of these wine snobs who is also totally ignorant about wine .
i can say this was absolutely the best experience we had in urbana .
enjoy .
however , their new location is n't as great as the old one .
it has changed .
i mean purple and bloody , too , not just slightly pink .
i have never seen poultry that undercooked in a restaurant before .
now , at the new larger place , they seem a bit stretched .
i 'm back !
long hiatus over , back to yelping . )
if nothing else , try their goat-cheese balls .
the same girl came over and was like , do you have a reservation ?
but how can you mess up salad .
so i guess that was a bad selection .
okay here 's the deal , i personally think the food is great !
however , the service is so-so .
the waitresses are hit or miss -- sometimes excellent and sometimes moody/incompetent .
the bathrooms are awesome .
gray and sleek with lots of mirrors .
one thing : why are the toilets set so close to the ground ?
wow , first meetings are deceiving .
we do n't offer entrees until dinner time . ''
my bad on messing up foodie-language .
excuse me .
oh man , these are to die for .
i wholeheartedly recommend ) .
what gives luna the four stars ?
( and expect a review after then too . )
we love luna !
they also pour generous glasses of wine .
it is such a cute restaurant .
like several other reviews here have said , they are just not the same .
this is the best restaurant in c-u .
the atmosphere is very quaint .
i am very excited to try their brunch menu sometime .
it 's perfect for a brunch but filling enough for later on too .
tapas is an awesome concept , and luna does it well .
they always have many small plates to choose from .
food has ranged from mediocre to very good .
great place to take a date .
it is practically the best thing on the menu and never disappoints .
not nearly as good and has a smaller/weirder selection of tapas .
and bring at least $ 40/person .
maybe i 'm not in the right crowd to enjoy the food .
the omelets are delicious .
it 's not perfect .
i 've had avocado issues .
i have had two experiences at luna cafe , one of which was good .
there is no way these could count as tapas .
needless to say , very disappointing , not worth the hefty price tag .
enjoy the ambiance of luna and there is solid food for the price .
but this is not a great restaurant ; it 's a lazy restaurant .
alas for you luna , you are deceived because this is not true anymore .
there are a lot of good places to eat now .
_ num _ hours for lunch is too long .
the food at luna is quite good and they have a nice bar .
nice ambiance but portions are kinda small .
thank you so much for doing so .
cafe luna is outstanding in several areas .
the food preparation is perfect .
dishes are high class .
the ambiance and decor are luxurious , but prices are quite reasonable .
service is competent , but not exceptional .
food : it is rare for a kitchen to get all of the little things right .
cafe luna 's kitchen gets every little detail right .
see the restaurant web site for the full menus for each meal time .
decor and ambiance : in any case , ceilings are high , as are the windows .
tables and chairs are very comfortable , the latter being upholstered .
service is ok , but not exceptional .
there appears to be a nice outdoor seating area .
service : service is competent but not exceptional .
price : price for value received is outstanding .
even in absolute terms , the prices are on the low side .
other : there are large public parking lots a block or two away from the restaurant .
i highly recommend cafe luna .
how is that possible ?
food this good merits _ num _ stars .
i see no reason why the rest of the menu wo n't impress .
ok - this review has been a long time coming .
i have visited luna four times now and each time is worse than before .
i have gone for lunch multiple times and it always averages two hours b.c .
the service is soooo slow .
the chef is searching for the pasta . ''
no thank you .
this place is so overrated it 's not even funny .
it 's so cold , loud and crowded .
disgusting !
i have a few qualms with luna .
i want to love this place but service is a huge deal for me .
the reviews are all over the place and many of them criticize the service .
the tapas themselves are where the place got knocked down to _ num _ stars .
third course : new york strip steak and lamp chops i swear on my life this is the worst steak i 've ever had .
what can i say ?
i understand it was a set menu day and their tapas are better .
however , what self-respecting chef/cook serves food this low-quality to anyone on anyday ?
i enjoy good food , but i 'm definitely no snob .
here is the review i posted on june 13th , _ num _ : dear caf luna , you had ruined my graduation dinner on may 14th , _ num _ .
thank you so much for doing so .
the beignets and eggs benedict are killerrrr .
ok , i am a food snob from los angeles .
this is tame in comparison .
this is probably my favorite place to eat in c-u .
i come from boston , the land of _ num _ indian restaurants .
however , bombay definitely hits the spot .
my husband is a bit more adventurous and he has never been disappointed .
it is quite a small place with _ num _ or less small tables .
it 's usually the naan that fills me up , not the curry .
i absolutely think that bombay grill has the best chicken mahkani .
no restaurants in chicago ( even on devon ) can compare !
i love their garlic naan too .
this is one of my favorite places in cu .
chicken tikka and lamb curry are my favorites .
with a mango lassi expect to pay around _ num _ bucks after tax and tip .
food is always fast and fresh here .
but i 'm not complaining !
this place makes no qualms about itself .
it is a solid punjabi joint , creamy curries , paneer and all .
the staff stare like they have never seen a woman before .
disgusting .
for all intents and purposes , this restaurant is basmati 's all over again .
the main courses cost about $ _ num _ more than on green street .
yes , please !
why is the lunch so affordable ?
this is indian food for poor college students .
bombay has been one of my favorite restaurants in champaign for almost _ num _ years .
it 's dark and cozy inside and smells of masala and fresh yogurt .
great selection of vegetarian entrees , too , for those that are into that !
when i 'm there , i go to this place all the time .
in case that were n't enough , they frequently give me free stuff .
i do n't totally understand why .
i 'm not really a regular , and i 'm not a supermodel .
maybe everybody gets free stuff .
i 'm not one to look a gift daal in the mouth .
this place has a great variety of food !
go here for lunch !
the portion is bigger and it 's cheaper .
the naan here is absolutely to die for .
the naan is fresh and amazing .
the naan is really great too .
i also enjoy the aloo tikki appetizer , as well as the samosas .
the naan is very good .
try the vegetable vindaloo - i put it on the menu !
i miss it .
particular favorite is the saag paneer and spicy chana aloo .
delicious curry , their _ num _ is also amazing .
they have several kinds of _ num _ , try the garlic or cheese stuffed !
the food is really good , terrific .
i know indian food .
well , you can use your imagination .
pretty ridiculous if you ask me .
i 've eaten at a lot of indian places and i love indian food .
food is not so tasty to admire .
it doesnt have the true authentic indian food taste .
they are smart enough to rob people .
sub-par indian food , which passes in town .
how is that there is no good indian food in champaign-urbana ?
there are so many amazing korean and chinese places .
the food here is generic and bland .
i know this because i am one of them .
this restaurant is a great deal for dinner !
only two negatives , no liquor license and the atmosphere is a bit lacking .
prices are very reasonable .
the food is good by champaign standards and ok by larger market standards .
this is the best indian food you 'll find in urbana-champaign .
many indian restaurants either are afraid of using spices or carelessly overdo it .
bombay grill nails that aspect , so it gets five stars from me .
their butter chicken and tandoori roast chicken are worth trying .
saag paneer is phenomenal for those interested in vegetarian options .
lunchtime special can not be beat !
we love bombay on green st !
lunch menu is cheaper .
that being said its great .
i just wish it did n't spill out .
so driver , easy on them turns !
i love this place !
the waiters are always attentive and friendly - if not too friendly .
learn from my mistake !
i wish i took a picture of the menu , maybe next time .
you also get a potato pakora .
$ _ num _ for grilled chicken and a few grilled onions is not a bargain .
the food is pretty good .
around 9:30 pm , i get a call from the delivery person .
he says , `` do you have your credit card ? ''
i respond , `` no . ''
mind you , i am in the law building .
my stuff is on the other side of the law building .
the naan is big and fresh .
the service is sub par .
the vindaloo tastes okay .
the lassi is waaayyy too thick .
they do have mango kulfi , which ambar does not .
this place is fantastic for lunch .
service is quick and the staff is friendly .
still , the food is reliable and delicious - check it out !
who works the counter .
_ num _ ) their samosas are amazing .
always get them !
bombay folks , please fix this !
really need to reduce prices rather than raising them .
the food is just average indian food , nothing special .
even when you eat in .
the food is n't cheap enough for that .
indian food has been my kryptonite as of late .
like the other reviews , it seems that overall bombay is a little overpriced .
i love the food in here !
i didnt finish the lamb biryani , perfect flavoring the malay masala was good too !
does n't seem like they put any effort into their food or service .
bombay grill is hands-down my favorite on-campus restaurant .
the curry is always creamy and flavorful .
i hope not to offend the manager but rather to have my vexation understood .
but that 's not my only source of frustration .
it 's just not knowing what you 're getting and making prices willy nilly .
the food is truly delicious though .
food is delicious .
i 'm not entirely sure i know they stay in business .
the ambiance is definitely lacking enough that i take down a star .
i mean , i 'm pretty sure it 's everyone 's favorite .
on their best days , they 're amazing !
= x i 've ordered takeout before during lunch hours and was always charge lunch price .
call them potato pakora .
that 's it , no more trying indian restaurants in champaign .
they carry a full line of humidores and smoking accessories .
it is a little cramped , but that 's of little consequence .
i just wish they 'd carry some smaller humidors .
i have n't been steered wrong by the staff yet .
excellent discussions ensue over many a bowl of excellent tobacco .
friends frequently bring items to share with others as well .
these fellows go above and beyond .
he always brings his best pipes and they sell them at excellent prices .
[ sorry folks , we are plagued with anti-smoking laws here as well ] antiques can be found in the estate drawers .
not all of them are low-priced !
be sure to say hi to pat .
he 's fantastic .
[ i have a tobacconist !
stuff like that makes me like this place even more !
feel confident in the suggestions made .
i think the owner said that they have ~ 60k cigars in stock .
additionally , this is by far the least expensive shop i have been to .
they 've got a great selection of cigars and pipes .
many other shops seem to carry pipes as an afterthought .
that 's not the case at jon 's .
they have a huge selection of pipes , and most are priced fairly .
plenty of accessories to round out your shopping experience .
this shop is everything that a pipe collector could want .
the shop keepers however , are smug and condescending .
other than that ... great place to smoke .
the food is great for lunch .
drink specials at night are super cheap .
i think they have $ _ num _ pitchers every night .
you 're a real asshole . ''
but sweet jesus , are they good .
now my cousin works there and hooks me up when i 'm in town .
even so , i still only politely ask for two and fries .
i do n't want anyone to think he 's still an asshole .
: ) these are seriously the best ever .
the breading , the sheer size , the honey mustard dipping sauce - mouth-watering !
these are the best chicken strips i have ever had .
they are huge !
great pizza on mondays deal !
this is good `` italian '' pizza .
( as italian as they say they are . )
seriously , how can you win the hearts of your customers with stinginess .
first , the service is slow .
second , the food is not that good .
gyros are below the average and chicken is too greasy !
i do n't wan na talk about fries ... so , this place is so overrated !
however , the servbice is still sooo slow .
the chicken fingers are exactly as good as advertised .
they 're the only reason i still order from this place .
other than that , it 's fairly crappy .
i 've had them lose my order before .
i sort of hate the place .
they 're good enough for me to sometimes ignore how bad everything else is .
i 've only ever gotten their chicken fingers combo .
the fries are kind of meh .
really , it 's all about the chicken .
i have to knock them a couple stars because they serve everything in styrofoam .
and because the restaurant does n't have a/c .
geovanti 's has one of the best chicken strip .
the chicken strips are ginormous !
also get the honey mustard sauce and you 're game !
however the fries are n't that great and lacks flavor .
overall , the service is mediocre .
it 's good when the workers are in a good mood .
it 's bad when the workers are pissed off at some stupid drunk .
it is true , other than the chicken strips this place sucks .
here are some tips for ordering : - ordering at night ?
do delivery rather than take out .
delivery is actually relatively good on campus .
- ask for extra crispy .
i do n't think i will ever return .
best damn chicken fingers i 've ever had .
that is all .
but that 's all .
so i come .
they 're that big .
you 're almost there geos !
i wonder how many people come in late night stoned with the munchies ... .
but who can turn down amazing chicken strips ?
i can tell you that i will never order from geovanti 's again .
under those conditions , i say go for it .
otherwise , stay away .
it 's cheap , the food is delicious and you get extremely large portions .
the top _ num _ things are : _ num _ .
bet you ca n't finish a 5-piece !
gyro - i love their gyro 's !
again , these things are massive so be prepared for leftovers !
i miss you geovanti 's !
and that 's about all i have to say about that .
i 've never had the pleasure of a problem-free order from geovanti 's .
everything else i 've had here is kind of low quality though .
the pasta sauce has no flavor and the gyros are garbage .
i really do like their chicken strips .
not so tasty the next day unless you put in oven .
the actual place is pretty dive .
dining in is pretty meh , it 's usually hot and sticky .
i love the chicken strips from here .
they have the best ranch dressing that i have ever had !
very happy that these two pieces of gold can be found in lincoln park !
those chicken tenders are a force to be reckon with .
however , the food is always a gamble .
fights with drunk/stupid customers never get old .
illini inn is the last dive bar remaining in campus .
go forth .
chug a beer .
join the mug club .
we 've pretty much given up .
it 's not a two star because i remember the glory days .
maybe , seriously , the funniest thing i have ever seen .
thank you for a memory that never fails to make me smile .
this is no joe 's , legends , or brothers .
most of the bartenders are polite , patient , and fun .
it 's a champaign institution .
too bad it may have gone downhill since .
the mug club is fun and makes this dive worth the visit .
this is a true neighborhood bar .
going back for at least one beer this weekend before the football game .
you say dive , i say hell yeah !
but the inn is entirely untainted .
the inn feels like a home .
in the end , that 's really all you could ask for .
we do n't go out , we go inn .
hopefully they do n't let anyone else downstairs anymore .
nothing good can come from that .
how does this place stay in business ?
apparently our two kinds of geek do not mesh .
g-mart has a better selection and the employees are helpful and funny .
i totally understand this .
overall , go to other realm if convenience is your biggest factor .
if you have a car , go to g-mart .
i have to say i found the shopping experience to be generally unpleasant .
i look at him like huh ?
i explain i am kneeling and was n't even reading just looking .
i have n't been treated that bad in a store since i was _ num _ .
i mean really when was the last time you dusted dude ?
for fast food sandwiches , i vote subway .
the only benefit of jimmy john 's is that they deliver .
wow ... no effort to satisfy a customer at all .
turkey sandwich are great here and they make it super quickly .
its much better than subway although that is not saying much nowadays .
the delivery is fast and consistently good .
online ordering is great .
i usually stop in on my way to work at least once .
i also live about a mile away .
thats some hardcore s ** t right there .
keep it up jj 's !
food is very good and accurate .
normally less than _ num _ in phoenix , which is about 30x as large .
when you order they just tell you `` as fast as we can '' .
every jj in any other city tells you x minutes .
but paying $ 9ish before tip is a little steep .
they stand a much better chance of being adopted .
i can not believe how awesome this place is .
the place is really clean and the staff are very very very helpful !
i wish all other shelters were like this : x adopted a _ num _ year old cat .
i have a pet adoption application pending .
hopeful i get to come home with a new walkin buddy !
she is a _ num _ year old border collie lab mix named lily .
i 'm positive she was abused by her previous family .
the dogs there are all sad .
the staff are very compassionate and helpful !
they do great work here .
donate or adopt !
good lo mein , and more recently they 've added thai entrees .
most dishes are vegetarian .
we can no longer call this place hog ... since they added the thai .
delivery is nice .
lacking a few of the standard components .
word of mouth is the only way to go here .
zomg this place is a uiuc mainstay .
it is fairly cheap and you get lots of asian food .
can we say gross ?
it 's not as if i had high expectations ... .
location is pretty bad for visibility , even if it 's convenient to campus .
i think that 's pretty sop here in cu , though .
portion sizes are okay .
for the uninitiated , there are basically three menus here .
the best menu is their authentic chinese menu .
this is on the wall to the right as you enter .
the third menu is the menu of thai items .
the place is small , but man the food is amazing !
every time ( no joke ) they have messed up my order .
save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else .
this is my favorite chinese place down here .
and that 's a good thing for hog .
the strangest rubbery texture i have yet seen .
vegetarians beware .
but it depends on whether if you are a panda express guy .
the place is small and average cleanness .
this is the worst chinese food i have ever had in my entire life .
read the bad reviews .
fish fillet floating in grease with absolutely no taste .
avoid at all cost .
why go here when there are much better restaurants around .
on another note , apparently they have hotpots there now ?
never go here .
they have the worst food in entire urbana-champaign area .
this place is under new management and is much improved .
to reiterate what has been said a couple times already , new ownership/management .
the lunch and dinner serving styles are different .
both are extremely good deals .
lunch is served like a school cafeteria with 6-9 entrees offered that alternate daily .
dinner is fantastic .
variety on the menu is incredible ; over _ num _ different dishes offered .
my favorite dishes : the stir fried green beans are unbelievable .
they chili oil fish is fantastic if you like spicy food and fish .
ma po tofu has a truly authentic mala spicy taste .
the employees are very willing to tweak any dish to any preferred taste .
downsides : small venue so it gets extremely crowded noon-1 and 6-7 .
i look forward to coming back again and ordering off of the dinner menu .
the lunch line moves quickly .
i love this place .
the name is so quirky too , which is what originally drew me in .
it 's not all made of the batter and sauce like most places .
you actually taste the chicken here .
it is sooo cheap , and you get a mountain of food .
i can never finish all of mine !
the ladies serving are so friendly as well .
if you like peppers , that is the dish for you .
as other reviews have said , the portions are large and inexpensive .
eat here .
eat everything here .
or do n't eat here .
come back the next day and do it again .
do it the next day .
go home and think about your life .
go to the gym .
do everything to not think about the food .
wait sleeplessly for dawn .
wait the eternity for the gift from above to get to you .
leave and never be the same again .
do n't be put off by its humble size and decor .
its portions are more than generous .
to top it off the service is always friendly , and super generous .
we are currently making `` i heart hog '' shirts .
this place is serious .
this restaurant is amazing !
i 've never gotten more value as a college student in my life .
a lunch special honestly equals about two meals .
oh my goodness , how i love home of gourmet .
hope they have more space .
service is so-so but understandable since they are so busy .
it 's only _ num _ cents to add on another entree .
listen , they do n't mess around with the portions .
they give you a lot of food , for so little !
and it 's damn good food too .
this is my strongest preference !
everything i 've gotten here i 've liked .
the dishes are all put together well .
i 've been here again since my first review .
man , this place is so packed during lunch hours .
i do like the free water bottles that come with your orders though .
everything is pretty much pre made and very quick to get .
the staff is very friendly .
i usually get the orange chicken with rice and bok choy .
food is delicious and portions are extremely generous for the price .
the place may look a little janky but defintely worth stopping by .
they also have a wide variety to choose from .
never tried their entrees but the platters that you pick from are always delicious .
they have good portions and a great menu of your basic thai dishes .
they have different chefs so it tastes a little different each time .
i love the pad se ewe and pad thai .
this place is very affordable and is a favorite among uiuc students .
however , the food is practically tasteless .
this , i have to say is a major disappointed .
avoid at all cost .
a quick look at the menu : it looks pretty standard .
and walk in .
the spring rolls were okay , i suppose , though really not that great .
first , why do they use ground chicken ?
that 's just wrong .
ground chicken is wrong .
the latter ( basil thai ) is by far the worst .
in summary , two words : stay away .
the red and green curry is also awesome .
no , potatoes do not count .
they 're not green .
curry is hard to mess up because it has such strong flavor .
their service is quick and relatively inexpensive .
however , there are better sit-down thai restaurants in town .
i usually order both because i need my fix when i 'm home .
i miss basil thai : ( doug , doug and more doug !
really nice massage practice covering champaign/urbana/savoy .
the arc location offers student discounts , too !
kim moore is fantastic , as are the other staff i 've worked with .
strongly recommend .
i 'm done with enterprise for good .
this place is awesome .
but how is that possible if i rented from them so many times already ?
they are nice .
never renting with them again ... i do not recommend it !
by far the worst service i have ever had in my life .
words can not explain how greatly i regret giving ppm my money .
do not rent from ppm .
oh god , where do i start ?
ppm is one of the leaders in this area .
stay away !
staff is rude , inconsiderate .
staff is not friendly .
this company 's name is a joke .
i have lived in la , chicago , nyc for many years .
but that 's not the worst part .
why not appeal to god directly ?
say they are doing it for jesus ?
so , the work is quality and they do not gouge you .
rick 's has always been good to me , extremely fair and competent .
they are uber-honest , and way more affordable and quicker than a dealer .
they 've handled everything from my toyota mini-van to my porsche .
my car is a range rover .
although the price is a little bit high , they are the best .
they know my car and can solve the problem exactly .
rick himself is a very down to earth guy , and very skilled .
they seem fair , honest , and able .
i have been going by millage since i started driving .
i never drive 3,000 miles in _ num _ months .
when they can clearly see that my car is 15,000 miles from that benchmark .
their approach to customer service is bizarre .
i cant say thats ever happened to me before so i was very pleased .
there 's a _ num _ dollar coupon on their website too .
i go here for an oil change .
they are super fast and friendly !
i know they can wear early , but that is really early .
that explains my poor performance !
pretty efficient and recommend their early bird specials 2/21/2015 i stopped by to get my oil changed on my way home .
having asthma his `` sorry '' was n't good enough .
i come here every time i need a oil change .
i never have any problems with them .
the staff is very friendly .
they get the job done fast and well .
there is n't much more i could ask for .
they go over all the recommendations so its easy to understand .
highly recommend .
i always go here for an oil change .
i have never had this problem .
now you 're looking at luke warm veggies with semi-warm meat .
it just takes too dang long to get the entire meal on your plate .
wow , get way to start & end a meal .
either way , the food is eh for 20 + dollars .
for a one time experience , i say it 's worth it .
do n't waste your time .
the price may be decent , but the food lacks the same feeling .
it 's worth trying .
champaign has a few places that purport to sell japanese food .
ko-fusion and a few chiefly korean restaurants come to mind .
first of all this is not one of my favorite types of foods .
the portions are really small which really did n't bother me .
i think this place deserves a _ num _ star .
i really have a mixed feeling about this place .
i love this place .
it looks nice and very clean on the inside .
we have been dining here since _ num _ .
quality is way above average and they honor their reservations .
oustanding service .
miso or clear soup ( tip : add pepper if you like ) house dressing - to die for ... mmmmm the best dressing sauteed mushrooms !
treat yourself !
take a date !
have a brew !
as far as i remember , this place is pretty good .
love their sushi and tapan .
this place is always packed for reasons i ca n't quite grasp .
the parking lot looks crowded every time i drive by .
i only have one thing to say about the service here .
this is the kind of place that gives sushi a bad reputation .
menu presents typical appetizers individual cuts rolls bento boxes and dinners , again typical .
service , mediocre , collage or high school fumbling job .
i have eaten here a few times , depite the poor reviews .
place is relatively nice .
i recommend the rainbow roll , fantastic .
we still stop in most every time i visit , usually for the teppan .
still , they do well .
the food tastes the way a public bathroom smells .
i think they raid dumpsters for their ingredients .
i have frequented miko 's , but a meal at kamakura has converted me .
the sushi is fresh tasting and just delicious .
for the champaign area this is as good as it gets .
i go for the sushi and i have never been disappointed .
the fish is the highest quality you can get in the area .
sushi is all about the rice and kamakura has the best in town .
the food is great and seasoned appropriately .
the service is also great .
overall this is the best japanese restaurant in town .
it 's cheap for what you get .
the service is friendly and warming .
i 've tried kofusion , sushi kame , and yellowfin .
the teppan is great as well .
each chef has a unique personality and cooking style .
it makes going more often enjoyable and different everytime .
this is the only japanese restaurant owned by a japanese family .
i can not image turning away business in a poor economy .
the sushi at kamakura is good .
i have n't been and wo n't be back .
you leave feeling so full !
the problem with this place is the service .
going there with girl .
minutes go by .
after almost an hour , talking to the waiter .
more time passes by .
finally my lunch box comes in .
in market place mall is many many degrees of magnitude better .
how about the sushi we ask ?
to go .
you really are better off buying sushi at schnuks .
there are much better places in the nearby area .
i think this place is one of the better sushi places in champaign-urbana .
not every place has this good of unagi !
quality is what kamakura presented .
the sign is n't flashy , but this place is definitely worth noticing . )
there is only _ num _ teppanyaki grills and at least _ num _ chefs .
this is not benihana .
i repeat , this is not benihana .
this is a nicer place .
their major foible is the fact that their food never truly gets you stuffed .
this place does neither .
the price is n't worth it for the quality or quantity .
what else can i say ?
i 'm going back soon .
not enough waiters , the chef has to come out to serve by himself .
staff is so friendly .
we always sit at the sushi bar .
i love the salad with house dressing !
i 've never had a bad meal there !
the service is very slow .
the ramen is so bad .
hard to eat .
i will never order it again this place is a joke !
never coming here again !
one to take our order and two to give us our food !
first to be seated last to be served !
this place sucks !
take your chances on a saturday night !
i think she might have been busy and been given too many tables .
- reservations are suggested .
i * love * this store .
- prices are decent , but not always affordable .
cons : - they have no return policy .
that 's pretty crappy , especially for a store that offers some pricy items .
this is my biggest problem with the store by far .
- they run out of a lot of stuff close to halloween .
so do n't go looking for something two specific or you may be disappointed .
dude , this place is awesome .
there 's also some rentals if you need something last minute .
no matter what , the staff is super helpful .
there 's also , of course , a whole magic section .
my _ num _ year old loves to check out all the costumes .
the staff is super nice and do n't mind her trying things on .
we usually do n't buy much .
i have gotten a couple birthday gifts there .
good source for little kids ' party favors .
and needless to say , i do n't have that problem anymore .
i highly recommend this eye care place .
their frames selection is very limited in terms of economic pricing .
so i go back to get it adjusted .
doctor ( i think johnson ) is very knowledgeable and explains everything quite well .
dr. sanders is excellent .
dr. sanders and her whole staff are prompt & go above and beyond .
definitely recommend .
she is very knowledgeable and willing to help me out .
this place is deceiving .
i wish i never had known about the place .
: ) ) , and it 's appreciated !
this is like the original seaboat x _ num _ .
it 's well ventilated , there 's seating , and there 's a tv .
the food is still awesome .
i 'm just jealous that this came around long after i left the area .
seaboat is the best fried southern food around .
the wait is long , but the food is definitely worth it !
i have been there twice and both times i have not been that impressed .
the fish is n't anything special either .
maybe it 's because i am not a regular .
i do n't think i will give this place a third chance .
a few favorite things are great here .
the best strategy is to call ahead .
i always call ahead .
what we 've ordered over two visits : sides : fries ( a bit undercooked , but decent ) .
i wish they would note this on the menu .
fyi : the fish is served on wheat buns .
i wish they had better bread .
the prices are excellent and the variety on the menu is outstanding .
she 's the expert and her word is gospel .
that 's my personal preference .
i want to come back and try the fried chicken !
just love their fried fish , either in a dinner or a sandwich .
fries are good .
my favorite side is their slaw .
there is pineapple in it and it just hits the spot .
always have a piece of sweet potato pie for dessert .
price is reasonable .
seating for dining in and the place is very clean .
definitely recommend .
it 's very clean inside and the service is friendly .
prices are n't super-cheap but the quality is very good .
i like their seaboat fish sandwich , and their fries are thick and delicious .
additional sides are quite pricey for the small quantity you get .
better to stick with the combos and skip the a la carte items .
if you do , you can eat here for under ten bucks .
free refills on drinks if you 're dining in .
i recommend seaboat !
hmm , but that 's not it .
i agree - better than heat lamps and microwaves any day .
this is a qualified _ num _ stars .
the service here can be quite bad .
their sides are also generally pretty good , with a ton of variety .
finally , finish it off with some sweet potato pie which is excellent .
there 's not much i can actually say about it .
if you have room , get some sweet potato pie .
it is great .
i have never tried it , but one can order online as well .
if staying in one of the hotels near assembly hall or the stadium .
the fried fish , though , is fantastic .
the seaboat sandwhich is great .
the wait is pretty long , so just be sure to call ahead .
online menu is vague .
mac and cheese is awesome but small portions .
biggest complaint is drive thru window ... beyond slow , give yourself _ num _ minutes wow .
i am just not that soulful .
the seaboat sandwich is the best fish sandwich i 've ever had .
i love the okra and the collard greens .
however their customer service is the worst .
i 've eaten just about all of the fish and chicken entrees , delicious !
that 's the price you pay for deliciousness .
go to windy city express if you want good food and timely service !
the catfish is fire !
it is well done and worth the wait .
i also like seaboat because there are many non-pork options .
orders take a little while so it 's best to call ahead .
i love this place !
a little pricey but the quality of food is really good .
the food is great .
the wait is insane .
are they catching the fish ?
well do n't i feel special .
the food here is great .
this is the kind of restaurant i could eat at everyday .
it looks like you can call ahead too .
mistakes happen , as a restaurant your goal is to make the customer happy .
not very fast but the food is fresh and tasty .
i love their coleslaw .
the food is very good , but your wait may be longer than stated .
the seaboat is now permanently closed .
the champaign olive garden has declined significantly within the last year .
well , it 's not like that anymore .
i do n't think i will be going back there ever again .
in truth , the food quality is comparable to a fast food restaurant .
i know it 's just olive garden .
i know it 's an evil chain restaurant and a glorified mcdonalds .
i guess the thing is that it did n't used to be this way .
i think i 've heard that they are under new management .
but now it 's not .
the seams are showing .
quality of service and presentation has gone way down .
corners are being cut and it shows .
and the chairs have wheels !
heck , ask for it after the check arrives .
it 's like a glass of water - it should always be full .
fyi , the sangria is f-ing expensive .
the house salad is awful and so are all the soups .
the only reason why i go there .
this location does get ridiculously packed all the time for some reason .
our servers have always been attentive and friendly .
if you do n't ... well then you 're in for a surprise .
nothing much to write about the rest of the experience .
this olive garden really emphasizes excellent service in everything they do .
the service and foods do n't worth the price .
this olive garden leaves me very confused .
love the extra cheese on top of anything you want .
but the staff is really nice .
waiter always making excuses , food not as good as in past !
i have been to this olive garden so many times over the years .
and this is the first time i was disapointed .
i love olive garden , but this one seems to have poor service .
the only reason why i keep coming here is for the salad and breadsticks .
somehow my two bowls of soup came out lukewarm which was quite disappointing .
pro : unlimited soup/breadsticks or salad if you want hidden gem : check sunday paper for coupons .
it 's a chain restaurant and yes , it 's pretty average .
we always hope manager susan is working !
food is worth every penny and service is awesome !
ask for the peach tea .
$ _ num _ for a meal there and then another meal to take home .
the _ num _ stars is due to the area .
i have zero complaints about our food , just the service was awful .
i really appreciate that the manager went above and beyond for the customer .
they are so inn our face saying `` make sure you pay '' .
good food but lacks a family friendly environment .
apparently olive garden is a hot commodity in champaign ... .
2/5 let me begin by saying that our waiter was very friendly !
although he was really pushing the add an item into the bill .
it 's american style food , service is nice welcoming .
foods are cheesy and tasty .
my five stars go to her !
thank you shay for your amazing customer service !
: ) the review is only in regard to the service from the waitress shay .
i 'm appalled .
my girlfriend and i always have great service and food here .
i am not sure why this restaurant gets so busy .
salad dressing very sour .
games on the tablet that comes with every table , costs money .
bathrooms at this restroom needs attention !
however , when the two things are combined , the activity turns out positive .
the owner is so cool and can answer all your brewing questions .
i 've been going here since i was literally a wee one .
the owner is awesome ( and even remembered me on my last visit ) .
it 's a great little shop .
me : but the door says _ num _ ... me : so , you 're only open this week ?
me : do you ever close earlier , if it 's busy ?
her : well , we like to stay open until _ num _ .
check the date before you buy it !
i did buy some tea still , they carry golden moon !
this place is an institution for me .
but this is champaign , specialty demands spendiness .
are available in both loose-leaf and teabag form .
: ( i am thinking they do n't have good turnover .
but if you love quality and freshness , avoid !
tea , i adore it !
it is a tiny little store which is crammed with cute things to buy .
this shop has fresh tea , and it has stale tea .
this is one of my favorite shops !
they have really good prices on tea , and they sell coffee too !
so many options of tea to choose from .
this is a great little shop to get gifts for your mom or grandmother .
drinking one of them right now - superb quality , great taste .
and the staff is super nice and helpful , definitely coming back !
do n't take the tea and spice prices for granted .
i wish i lived closer so i could come here more often !
walnut street tea is my favorite little tea shop in existence .
it 's so cute inside , and their teas are super affordable and delicious .
i love all the adorable teapots and accessories they sell too .
i often buy stocking stuffers or small gifts for friends here .
i hope this adorable corner teashop is around for a long , long time .
too good to resist .

the women who work here are extremely nice and helpful .
the pieces are extra small .
overall , there are plenty of better places for chocolates .
my dad : loves this place .
the caramels are his favorite piece of sweet heaven they make my sister : muy deliciouso me : hard to not love this place .
the dark chocolates are just sooooooo good in particular .
check it out .
the hostess mints are magical .
that 's all i want now and forever .
caramels and pecan clusters are also the jam .
if you 're in the mood for chocolate , do n't think twice .
those are memories from my childhood .
i enjoy a good biryani , and they 've got it here .
several dishes are vegetarian , but meat dishes are prevalent .
the saffron rice is sooo good .
the service is decent but sometimes pretty slow .
they also have a few other dishes besides indian which is nice .
the food tends to be spicey and pretty authentic !
a lot of what they offer is geared toward the vegetarian crowd .
the complaint is the temperature of the food .
nothing i have ever ordered has been sizzling .
the food itself is just ok ... nothing has a distinctive aroma .
i say , go for the buffet on thursdays or sundays .
buffets are exactly that subpar to average quality food at an inexpensive price .
this is my neighborhood oriental ( more korean than other asian ) store .
store review : this is my first stop into a asian market down in champaign .
it seems to be well stocked and maintain .
the prices are average to slightly higher compared to chicago land asian markets .
there is a variety of goods from ramen to tofu to frozen fish .
chinese brocoli , bokchoy hidden deals : none yet the ribeye is the best for the greatest steak in town .
the wine list is basically two choices : white or red .
the menu is basically two choices : steak or chicken .
but yes , the salad bar is good .
this is a place you only go to for one reason - steak .
expect throngs of locals , esp .
the fresh bread you get there is out of this world too .
but i guess it is worth it .
i normal do n't eat steak but that steak and the chicken is good .
i also have a glass of wine with my dinner that is very delicious .
the pickled beets and freashly baked slight deepfried bread are awesome .
the decor is more than slightly dungeony from the moment you walk in .
i really do n't get some of the reviews of this place .
the salad bar is fabulous ?
ok , you people need to get out of central illinois more ... .
so here 's what this place is about .
it is called the ribeye and that is a perfect name for it .
just about the only thing you can order here is a ribeye .
so you better like ribeyes if you come to this place .
what is good about it ?
the salad bar is terrible .
where are the mixed greens or spinach ?
unless you want a _ num _ ounce ribeye .
then they 've got you covered !
i travel , try to get this anywhere - you wo n't find it .
the salad bar is nice , for me not that big of a deal .
the little loaf of bread is a nice touch .
the food is awesome though .
fair is stretching it .
not on my list to revisit in the future !
they make the ranch dressing and that is always a plus in my book .
they have real bacon bits .
that along with homemade ranch dressing is the best in my book !
i advise go early ( they open at 4:00 ) or make reservations .
yes , they only offer ribeye steaks .
no deceiving there .
hence their name , the rib eye is solid and unpretentious .
personally i like it better when i 'm not picking up the bill .
the vegetables are reasonably fresh and there 's a fair amount of toppings .
even so , this is not a good place for a vegetarian .
the steak fries are big and crispy but just a little bland to me .
ambiance/decor is n't the best , sure , but it serves its purpose .
the service here is fantastic .
the servers are professional , polite , friendly , and attentive without being overbearing .
the highlight for me , however , is the salad bar .
is it haute cuisine ?
but it is solid , simple , and delicious .
the price is n't terrible .
two people with soft drinks and before tip comes out to $ _ num _ .
ambience and decor : let me first describe the restaurant 's ambience .
the restaurant is a dark , windowless interior space .
i imagine drinks and dinner while watching a football game would be an example .
there is a full bar in a space connected to the dining area .
food : the food at ribeye is not to my taste .
the ribeye steak is low quality meat .
eating the steak is not a pleasant or satisfying experience .
the salad bar comes with most dinners .
overall , the salad bar is not worth ordering .
it just is not very good .
bread is a hot , fresh loaf , but mediocre nonetheless .
also , ribeye does something to its butter .
these do n't appear to be prepared to order .
summary : it also has the feel of a sports bar .
prices are pretty much in line with what ribeye offers .
that is , prices are neither too high nor are they particularly good values .
service is adequate but unremarkable either way .
for me , this all is about _ num _ 1/2 stars on yelp .
the price is increased but the steak size is reduced .
the salad bar that people rave about ?
hell , even the courier cafe in urbana has a better salad bar !
disgusting .
my family has been going to the ribeye for over _ num _ years .
the staff is professional and very knowledgeable and helpful .
the ribeye steak is what you come here for and is worth it .
the ribeye knows how to cook it and serves on a sizzling plate .
my steak has been good every time ive went .
salad bar is free if you order an entree .
it needs a different spot in the restaurant .
my fiancee and her family have been going to this place for years .
the service is always excellent and the food is consistently great .
this is definitely a special occasion restaurant due to it 's steep prices though .
i 'm sure she will love it as well as i did this restaurant is a great local spot with very good food .
ill definitely go again .
i believe it , very tasty !
would compare this is the sizzler .
ask `` where would you go tonight if cost did n't matter ? ''
and if that does n't work ask `` what restaurant is your favorite ? ''
the quality of the steak is on par with almost expired meat from walmart .
do n't plan to visit again unless someone else is buying .
the decor has n't changed in 20 + years , i 'm sure .
however , the restaurant itself is very clean .
the salad bar is my favorite -- always fresh , crisp and cold .
i ca n't overstate the freshness -- you constantly see employees changing the salads .
however , the steaks are always juicy and full of flavor .
i always get the grilled chicken with extra barbecue sauce .
it 's seriously the best out there .
i do n't like twice-baked potatoes anyways , and their 's is no exception .
i usually order steak fries or rice pilaf .
they have drinks , but they appeal more to the older crowd .
no biggie for me , i usually order iced tea or wine anyways .
the quality of the food and service is consistent .
go in with an open-mind .
they do what they do very well .
love the salad bar !
a modest but flavorful wine selection is available .
large portions - that 's the best i can say .
but if it 's meh , who cares ?
it 's good , for what they are doing .
maintaining status quo for their regular customers .
to me , the salad bar is the best thing .
this is a steak house for the older clients .
always the same , and that 's ok .
i 'm used to a thick narrow cut of beef .
the menu is very simple .
the ribeye is very thin and comes out on a hot skillet .
and they do a pretty good job .
this is not that kind of place , although it thinks it is .
the menu offers three options : ribeye , chicken , or shrimp .
i understand that the salad bar is a big draw for some people .
then you look at the menu and the three dinners cost between $ 16-23 .
i do n't mean to trash this place too much though .
i have to give them props for being cool about everything .
you can get a mediocre steak for a lot less .
oh , and do n't order the fries !
i love that the menu is limited ... makes the decision process easier !
menu is limited to what they do best .
when in champaign illinois give it a try .
the steaks are ok , but thin for the price and always overcooked .
the shrimp is ok , too .
the salad bar here is beyond amazing .
food and serve is also excellent .
ps ~ brian is the best waiter .
he always remembers us and is super personable .
as a townie , i 've been eating here on special occasions for years .
i am only halfway joking .
they do have a salad bar that is included with your dinner .
pros : nice service , kind of cool retro atmosphere cons : bland over priced food , over inflated reputation nothing particularly outstanding about this establishment .
there 's nothing i like more than a well marbled ny strip .
it 's all fresh , favorful and kosher !
it 's the local butcher shop me and my fiancee had been waiting for .
it 's a good thing for customers in the know ... every piece of meat i 've had here has been delicious .
you can also get some lunch food here .
their deli selection is small , but i find they have everything i need .
it is spotlessly clean inside , and full of tip top meats !
the best beef i have seen outside of texas and new zealand !
employees who are helpful and actually know everything about their products ?
the best yeast rolls i have ever found anywhere ?
fresh bones for my dogs to chomp on ?
and the list goes on ... .
and their bacon is to die for .
the best bacon i have ever had .
i 'm drooling just thinking about it .
this place is so awesome !
they are always willing to go the extra mile here .
i highly recommend this place !
this place is the best place to get meat in the c-u area .
change but they still have the classic bratwursts and mild and spicy italian sausage .
my complaint is that their hours and location could be better .
their staff is always helpful and they can help with getting special meat cuts .
best place around to buy quality meats .
i always go here when meat is to be the star of a meal .
this is a wonderful butchershop .
prices reasonable considering the quality .
the staff is very helpful and friendly .
they also have a small selection of fresh fish .
also can recommend the pickles from the pickle barrel : ) knowledgeable , friendly staff .
sirloin patties and the twice baked potatoes are my go-to choices here .
i can not recommend this shop enough .
this place is the best .
if you need meat there is no better place in the area .
it 's so nice to have a locally owned butcher .
the customer service is outstanding and the prices are affordable .
my favorites : fresh ground beef for very juicy burgers fresh sausage , especially the kielbasa which is heaven i love this place !
the large twice-baked or loaded potatoes are absolutely to die for !
excellent supplies for bbq/smoking .
the staff is always amazing and the cuts of meat are even better .
i simply have not found anything there i do n't like .
the staff is friendly and the meats are delicious .
definitely worth checking out as bbq season gets rolling !
we love ( d ) this place .
and , i mean ... who does n't .
never buy that nasty meat again .
i mean .
for such reasonable prices , it 's a wonder everyone does n't shop there .
oh wait , they do !
=d you can tell just by the parking lot .
parking can be a bit tricky .
they carry the beef house rolls !
; d i use this when i ca n't get to the meat science lab .
when items are on special , they have some pretty great prices .
everyone is very helpful and they have such a wide variety of items .
they also offer boar 's head deli meats which are delish !
i only wish they were open sunday 's too !
they also have fresh fish which is super convenient !
highly recommend .
this is a quality butcher shop if you want to get quality meats .
where else can you find smoked chicken , cheese curds , and frog legs ?
i 've gotten some really good porterhouse steaks here .
they are never pretentious and are always really willing to answer any questions .
you really have to come here to see what i mean .
it 's a little expensive but you get what you pay for .
the staff knows their product and their customers .
truly gourmet items at reasonable prices beef , pork , chicken , and fish , they 've got it all .
the potatoes are opposite the meat counter for the true midwestern folks .
this is definitely the place to go for excellent fresh meat and fish .
i swear their salmon is the very best in the area .
the staff is just as amazing .
olde time is a carnivore 's dream .
they provide exceptional service and delicious meats .
you can get just about anything to grill or smoke at this place .
and the prices are good .
i do n't like that they have so many things in the center aisles .
makes it hard to shop especially during the holidays .
the only place to get my husbands pants .
has some really cute kids clothes .
i buy much of my casual clothing there and find the selection quite accommodating .
can buy a whole bunch of $ _ num _ , _ num _ clothes .
has some unique brands which other stores dont have like simply vera wang .
our kohl 's in champaign is awesome !
the return department is second to none .
i 'm a huge kohl 's fan because of our local store .
who does n't love kohl 's ?
people who have n't shopped at kohl 's !
my work shoes are falling apart .
who still gets fila ?
i do .
these shoes are awesome .
i get them at kohl 's !
i 'm not that large .
not that i care .
the gf is like `` wait , you have a kohl 's card ?
`` , and i 'm like `` yep '' .
the lady then asks , do you have a smart phone ?
and i 'm like `` yep '' .
sadly , no kohl 's kash today : ( as we are leaving , we walk past the jewelry section .
there 's `` watch and ___ '' combo thingies available .
huge selection and tons of weird looking critters to stare at .
my friends and i refer to this place as the aquarium .
and that is n't even the complete list !
the staff there is extremely knowledgeable , nice , and helpful .
you have to check this place out !
this place is waaaaay over priced .
they take advantage of being the only exotic pet store in town .
i try to avoid them as much as possible .
this is a great store .
the employees are very helpful and knowledgeable .
baby rats appear out out of no where !
they have high quality animals and best prices .
they are extremely knowledgeable .
i love this place !
they take good care of all their critters .
they do have nice fish .
staff here are very friendly and helpful .
very knowledgeable staff and they have a great selection of fish and other animals .
sailfin is awesome .
this is a small biz that truly cares about their pets and products .
well , there is a downside and a benefit to everything .
the staff at sailfin are so knowledgeable .
they know the natural habitat of the animals they sell .
if they are selling you a product , there is a reason .
this pet store is the perfect example of how a small biz should be .
support your local small business and you 'll be supporting your community .
i owe it all to intelligent staff there !
thanks sailfin , keep doing what you do .
it 's really uncomfortable for them , and their tails can actually detach .
even if it means traveling to another town .
i 'm a fish guy , and this place is great !
i have been to this store numerous times .
my experience is hit or miss .
this is the greatest place to buy yarn !
the yarn selection is fantastic and the teachers are great .
the knit alongs are fun as well as knit night .
this place welcoming and the prices are comparable .
staff is very friendly and helpful .
going back again !
this is a home away from home store .
this is a really nice yarn store .
i have been to needleworks a few times for various projects .
every single time , the staff and the regular knitters have been incredibly helpful .
it 's such a nice place to be .
make sure you go when the decent employees are working .
highly recommend if you can get decent help .
here is why i think that : the sparkle factor on their diamonds i looked at was high quality !
: ) let 's get married in the backyard ! )
friday comes .
my ring is in , but his is n't .
size for us to use at the ceremony on sunday .
we 're exceptionally pleased with both rings .
i can not say enough good things about browne 's .
oh , and they are replating it !
how much does it cost ?
and i have to wait up to two days ?
they take care of their jewelry and their customers .
i can promise you that i will not be shopping for jewelry anywhere else .
it looks amazing .
my rings look brand new again .
they really take care of their jewelry and their customers .
thank you so much !
i highly recommend browne 's !
do n't go here !
they are the most incomeptent group of people i have ever met .
i do not recommend renting from u group at all .
there are much better apartments , and much better landlords in the champaign-urbana area .
university group staff is incredibly friendly and helpful .
specifically , the maintenance department is professional and quickly attend to your maintenance requests .
maintenance is terrible !
it takes a good month-2 months for them to even get back to you .
the leasing manager is terribly rude and the staff is clueless !
avoid !
avoid !
second they do not agree that it is dirty .
and finally when you move out , they deduct _ num _ dollars for cleaning .
these realtors act like dictators .
never rent their apartment !
they do not care tenants at all .
it 's suffering living in their apartment year round .
they have a very responsible maintenance department .
do n't rent from them if you have a choice !
the positive reviews here are jokes , they 're probably ug workers .
all i can say is : do not live with university group .
now we 've lived here for _ num _ months and the fan still maintains broken .
our handle on the apartment door almost dropped .
reported several times with the fan problem , ug does n't care at all .
i am a girl living alone .
can you imagine how terrified i was at that moment ?
this is rude !
they have my number and email .
why do n't they notify me in advance ?
the $ _ num _ is due to painting the wall , which is hilarious .
i can not think of a reason for the wall to be painted again .
if the wall is clean , why it is us to be charged !
and the parking lot is almost empty during the summer .
then the car get towed .
why do n't you leave a note for a visitor 's car ?
this is how differently landlord treat with their tenant !
carrie 's logo says it all `` funky to fabulous '' .
if you stop in , tell her gretchen says hi !
why , may you ask ?
imagine being a person of color who has just moved to champaign .
you 're new , confused , slightly nervous about everything .
and you stumble upon cool stores like furniture lounge or jane addams .
in the middle of the shelf , plain for all to see ?
that 's right .
she now angrily sits on my coffee table , making people feel uncomfortable .
do i feel comfortable that i bought it ?
and i officially hate carrie 's now .
but at least mammy is free .
so i 'm not surprised that she came into possession of one .
over the years , i have bought the following from them : black cartoon deer bookends an embroidered betsey johnson blazer a green wool jacket from a traditional austrian costume damask-covered victorian granny boots ties more cheap shoes go here with no agenda and you wo n't be disappointed .
i am greatly angered by and disappointed in this place .
also , carrie is not always the most friendly shop owner .
this place is really cool , but it 's also really overwhelming .
i give it five stars for the awesome stuff they have in there .
things like that should just be thrown away ... that comes out to about three stars right ?
if that is the case , stay away from here .
i am pretty happy with the vintage scarf 's i 've found .
meet great people .
one of the healthiest and most convenient places to get groceries on campus .
they have a variety of everything from organic cereal to environmentally friendly cleaning products .
however , my favorite items are the local foods .
however , soon they are planning to open it up completely to the public .
location is a plus .
definitely worth checking out .
have you ever walked , biked , or driven ( preferably walked or biked !
what 's more , many of the items are from local or family-owned businesses .
if you decide to leave , the fee is completely refundable , too .
check out the website link for more information .
the staff here are always friendly and extremely helpful .
you can become co-owner for a $ _ num _ investment buy-in .
it 's really new and clean which is nice .
it 's all in or all out , judas , okay !
i 'm a poor graduate student that has a very expensive diet .
even as a member they are on the side of ridiculously over priced .
it 's cleaner and more like a normal grocery store than most co-ops .
this co-op has more pretensions of grandeur than most .
i 'm from chicago .
so that 's not why it gets _ num _ stars .
i 've only been here once .
that 's when its irritating to see just how jacked up the prices are !
i spend hundreds of dollars there .
but there are problems with other members there .
their selection is ok ... but natural gourmet is better .
the co-op is a hub of activity in urbana with bike racks out front .
my husband and i live near chicago , , where whole foods stores abound .
we 're quite spoiled .
what to do about food ?
that said , this place is a gem , thus the _ num _ star rating .
it has the best that whole foods has to offer .
they list the farms their produce comes from , which i found charming .
the staff is very friendly and helpful .
the prices are reasonable , considering there is n't that much organic in town .
i 've been in here a few times .
i have n't bought anything though .
i love the free recipes and all the organic healthy choices .
despite the prices , they seem busy enough .
i think this place is pretty great .
it just is . )
their prepared foods are all excellent ; may i recommend the asian peanut noodles ?
it 's better than nothing !
bring your own bags so you do n't have to buy one !
i am very happy with the cg co-op .
their bulk section is really nice .
this is definitely the kind of local store that it feels good to support .
they have a very good selection of bulk goods , especially gluten free products .
i am proud to call myself an owner .
their bulk section is well-stocked and the selection of local produce is impressive .
i am thrilled for the expansion in the fall !
i shop the bulk bins because there is variety .
i shop the sale items .
i do n't buy much else .
you have to bring your own bags .
the look you 're going to get is pretty side ways so look out .
all i have to say ... is the pretense in this place is rich .
watch out !
the store is becoming a very very awesome place to shop !
the expansion is great .
they have more spices , an awesome tea selection and many other changes .
oh , they start to have a salad bar , which is so appealing .
they provide fresh side dishes and salads .
i love their expanded selection for spices.the bulk area just become my favorite part .
the fresh produce is on the more expansive side .
we all know living healthy in an organic life is very expensive here .
it 's not their 's fault .
they have expanded the store and it 's even better .
part of what makes this place so great is the people .
i shop here often and the employees genuinely seem like they enjoy their jobs .
they are easy to talk to , very helpful and kind .
go check 'em out !
sandwichs , pizza , soups , burritos , salads , etc meats , vegetarian , vegan , gluten free , etc prices are very moderate and cheaper than strawberry fields .
they also have a salad bar , pizza , and sandwiches .
there 's a bakery , coffee , and soups .
everything i 've tasted has been pretty good !
i recommend bringing your own bags and using cash or a debit card .
since the store expanded , it seems like prices have come down a little .
good selection and good prices , especially considering that everything is organic and/or local . )
they have a great selection , and the staff is incredibly friendly .
most excellent place even if it is a bit pricey .
i 'm so glad i found a co-op near champaign !
they have all the products a vegetarian health-nut could dream of .
i plan to do all of my grocery shopping here from now on .
they even have wine !
: ) it 's a lot bigger now and the staff is super friendly and helpful .
they have great vegetarian and vegan options and a wonderful salad and soup bar .
i love their ready made sandwiches !
try the egg-less salad sandwich , it is awesome .
i have tried to reproduce their recipe to no avail .
my only complaint is that some employees come off as lazy .
i mean , they do get paid to work , do n't they ?
we love our food co-op !
my children love shopping here with me .
calling this place a coop is a misrepresentation .
the prices of this place are on par with whole foods aka whole paycheck .
no thank you .
whenever we go visit her family , we always stop by the co-op .
lots of terrific variety and i have to agree with her about the soups .
common ground has a wonderful selection .
they stock local , organic and delicious produce , meats , and cheeses .
i love it all .
these people are the best people in the world .
i miss rainbow grocery !
otherwise , i love what they 're doing !
i 'm a vegetarian & extremely grateful for this store .
the have so many meatless products for me here .
i 've gotten organic food & medicine .
to start off , i have the most fickle debit card on the planet .
also , they have counter culture coffee .
that alone is worth _ num _ stars .
always give back or pay it forward , people .
this is a great place to get healthy , organic foods !
behind the scenes , it 's not as great as it seems .
i particularly like their fruits , vegetables , and bulk items .
i think most things here our overpriced and sub-par quality .
we are members solely for that reason .
for all other supplies , strawberry fields is a closer alternative and similarly priced .
this is a great place to get organic & natural foods & products .
it 's a nice & adjacent stop from the weekend farmer 's market .
there are outdoor dining areas , which are great when the weather 's nice .
the place is laid back & clean .
it 's consistently an enjoyable experience .
to put it simply , i just feel good when i shop here .
my favorite items : the quality is second to none and everything you buy is local .
: ) offers classes in their cafe section occasionally .
the miller farms stuff is very good in my experience .
love the friendly atmosphere and all the organic options available .
i love their sandwiches made on local bread with the most amazing pesto ever !
if i 've learned anything about local communities , it is to support them .
common ground is comparable to whole foods except on a more local level .
they have a great selection of vegan products !
i love the co-op idea so major kudos !
do n't go here if you can avoid it .
update : six months later my `` new '' radiator began spouting coolant everywhere .
this garage is a scam market !
probably my fav place to shop in champaign .
the men 's department is sorely lacking .
need more higher end items .
esp like their underwear section store review : at least they have a tj maxx in champaign .
the store itself is a bit cramped and the aisles very small .
i wish they would expand on that selection more .
the people at this store are beyond helpful .
this is by far the best drum shop i 've ever been too !
best drum shop between chicago and memphis !
i stop by anytime i 'm in town .
amazing drum shop !
skins n tins is everything a good drum shop should be .
pounce on their awesome cymbal sale in november !
edit : sale now is just all the time !
so pounce on their awesome cymbal deals at all times !
items are overcharged and there is no return policy .
indifferent and unhelpful personnel does not know the inventory of the store .
this company is a complete fraud .
wow are they jerks .
do n't give these people money .
i occasionally need a tool here and there for small jobs .
there are usually two guys working here .
like the other reviewers said , they are not very nice .
one of them is a little bit more friendly than the other .
we booked _ num _ tickets at 8:05 am on mar. 16th from champaign to chicago .
please do yourself a favor by not using greyhound !
this reminds me of the movie titanic where people jostle to get on lifeboats !
there is also a bathroom in the back , which is pretty clean .
there are two outlets per row , so charging electronics is convenient .
there is wifi on the bus too , but it does block inappropriate websites .
also , there are footrests under the seat in front of you .
art coop saves my ass every time .
they are open late and always have what i need .
go on , quiz 'em .
: / ) the prices are not great , definitely higher than dick blick .
i miss the old school art coop .
: ( of course it is in stock .
this is exactly why i love this store .
it 's also convenient by bus and a nice _ num _ minute walk from campus .
great store : ) i have nothing but good things to say about the art coop .
where do you go when your washer and dryer break down ?
that 's right .
i like to surf the net while separating my whites from the colors .
and no , that 's not racist .
the laundromat is clean and big , so that 's a plus .
thanks for letting us all know via internet .
we 're very happy for you .
definitely the best laundromat i have found in the c-u area .
the normal washers are $ 1.50 / load and then the dryers are $ .25 / 7 minutes .
they do have super speedy dry cleaning though ... .
seems thinner and colder ever since .
for dry cleaning they are extremely expensive .
they are open everyday , however .
they have lost our business for good .
on top of it all -- they are extremely expensive .
do not go here .
do n't support this business please .
however , now that it has happened twice , i do not trust them .
update : a day later , still no credit .
last time i use any starcrest dry cleaning .
this laundromat is the cleanest one we have ever been to .
this laundromat is connected to the dry cleaners and the air conditioning is comfortable .
this place has roaches !
it 's a shame it was the one closest to my apartment .
they also have coin machines that work .
i have yet to have a problem here .
it is fast and convenient .
i 've been here twice for dry cleaning .
you guys , if you have to move from champaign , go with allied .
you think i 'm going to come to illinois to see your apartment ? ''
go with allied !
if you are affiliated with the university you get a _ num _ % discount .
thirty minutes later no one shows and i call and cancel .
moving is stressful enough .
save yourself the worry and avoid like the plague .
do not .
do not .
do nottttt use this moving company !
they are absolutely terrible !
the owners are friendly and helpful and have a good eye for interesting items .
we 've scored some outstanding pieces at really good prices .
now i can listen to jessie 's girl on my turntable ironically all summer .
do n't judge me .
furniture lounge is simply the best shop to go to if : * you are redesigning your home and need furnishings , lighting , decor * you are trying to find a unique gift for a friend or relative * you love thrifting , antiques , or vintage * you love mid century modern design * you want to look at something interesting and beautiful !
scott and amanda are super nice and know their mcm furniture .
they have even thanked my via fb to shopping locally .
this shop is a true treasure for champaign 's mods .
i absolutely love the selection they have in this store .
i love the furniture and decorations .
it 's pretty fun just to look around and see everything .
i have the most amazing necklace ever , thanks to them .
they have some really unique pieces of jewelry .
i love the clothes , too .
i 've bought some of my favorite tshirts and sweaters there .
it 's worth it to go in and take a look .
lots of fun things to see and buy !
i kinda want everything in the store when i go in .
there is something for everyone , and price points for everyone .
we love furniture lounge !
this place looks as if the owners just raided the set of mad men .
they always have rad stuff every time i come in here .
the merry-ann 's at neil and kirby is a standby .
it is the typical greasy spoon and i love it for that .
forget your calorie-counting conscience at the door .
what is it about this diner down by the train tracks ?
or its hangover cousin that adds hamburger to the mess ?
` nuff said , but in case it 's not ... i mean , they have a `` hangover burger '' for f*ck 's sake !
i love breakfast food .
merry-ann 's has amazing breakfast food .
ergo , i love merry-ann 's !
thirsty impairs my judgement ) .
the stack after 1 am is the only thing i ever really came here for .
but it sticks out in my memory .
but its almost too new and clean to enjoy properly .
this place is dingy and small , but it gives it character .
you can find your regular grease-laden favorites here .
as far as specialties go , i 'd say , the diner stack ?
( note : rating only applicable from 2am-6am ) stack .
have n't eaten there since .
i know waffle house is generally pretty disgusting , but i love it .
so overall , a great cheap place to go .
it 's a diner .
merry ann 's is a great place , a true down home american diner .
they have great breakfast food , which is all i 've ever had there .
i definitely recommend it .
for those of you health conscious , perhaps you can have wheat toast ?
that 's about the only health alternative here .
it 's really the gravy that sets this breakfast delight apart from the rest .
amazing diner food , but that 's it .
it 's still a diner , no matter how you cut it .
the price is reasonable and they 're open till all hours of the night .
making my ridiculous drunken forays into champaign-urbana much more comfortable and filling .
i love this place , but it 's just a diner .
i seem to always get the really short and rude servers .
the ones that make you feel like you 're not supposed to be there .
so , there you have it .
it 's great food , poor service , great looking diner , great price .
but , man have my waitresses been bitches .
i have no interest in darkening the door of this diner again .
merry-ann 's is a cute , illini-paraphanalia-ed ( is that a word ? )
diner with overly hovering waitresses and bad orange juice .
their hash is amazing .
it 's the reason why i 'm giving merry-ann 's its single star .
merry-ann 's does not know how to make a good gravy .
they have this dish called the diner stack ... .
service is your typical diner service so not bad .
i 'm pretty picky about mechanically separated chicken .
maybe that 's snooty , but i just hate it .
i mean c'mon man , it 's a diner for goodness sake .
ahh yes ... the stack .
but the key to the diner stack is the gravy .
it looks real thick , but goes down surprisingly smooth .
any way you order it really , it 's a thing of breakfast beauty .
the other reason i hold this place in such high regard ?
i 've spent many a good time and never a bad time here .
do eat here .
do not judge it until you do .
do try the diner stack at least once .
do not eat all by your lonesome ( invite someone . )
do not go there to study .
do respect the staff and other patrons .
do tip well .
do not sit in silence .
do engage in good conversation .
do not talk about fight club .
and do come back now , ya hear ?
i know to some , it 's just a diner .
yeah it was far .
yeah it was never really clean .
yeah it was just diner food .
i 've been to marry-ann 's several times while visiting friends in champaign .
but hey , that 's what i expect form a place like this .
just take it for what it is ; cheap , greasy eats .
i suggest the diner stack with lipitor for dessert .
this is a total drunk-food/hangover spot for sure .
horrible service , ok stack .
oh , also , i wish they had heinz ketchup .
merry-ann 's diner is the definition of mediocrity when it comes to diners .
unfortunately , champaign has a lack of diners and _ num _ hour restaurants .
merry-ann 's diner is a truck stop style _ num _ hour breakfast diner .
unfortunately , merry-ann 's is not very good .
i suspect that this diner was designed to duplicate the successful waffle house model .
service is roughly comparable to that of other waffle house stores .
( and the quality delivered is mostly poor . )
the merry-ann diner is not suitable for breakfast at any time of day .
merry-ann 's just does n't do it for me .
1st off i have not eaten here in over _ num _ years .
this place is nostalgic .
but it 's consistently the worst coffee in town .
you can taste the stale .
even so , it 's a diner .
i can make better food at home for cheaper .
pros : friendly service , clean hidden deals : monday to friday _ num _ am to _ num _ am _ num _ eggs , _ num _ pancakes , _ num _ ham for _ num _ ham omelet _ num _ all day specials mon-thurs super burger _ num _ grilled ham and cheese _ num _ best place for a hangover meal !
it 's a cute diner !
it 's suppose to be that way .
the breakfast burrito is very good .
ordered a mega omelet with no ham , it comes back with ham .
it comes back -- ham again !
not coming back .
otherwise , there are a ton of better options in town for the price .
that 's about the best i can say for them .
merry ann 's is definitely a place to recover from a rough night .
i just love breakfast .
the breakfasts are always fast , tasty , and cheap .
what more can you ask for ?
what more to expect for a diner -- great food and a relaxed ambiance .
an old-school diner that is exactly where it should .
it 's always pleasant to find a good greasy american breakfast joint !
and you do n't have to drive all the way up to north prospect .
having _ num _ billion things on your menu does n't make you a good restaurant .
but still , it hurts my head just to open the menu .
i mean , come on .
it 's endless right ?
wrong , not if they do n't ask you if you want more .
i think i maybe had _ num _ bites of it .
fridays is fridays .
i do n't know what people expect of the food .
it 's a chain restaurant , not gourmet .
the only problem is that they serve it only on sunday .
we have very limited places in champaign that serve good fried chicken .
the wait staff is extremely friendly and the place is always clean .
this place has real good food .
we always seem to have the jack daniels ribs .
they are so good they melt in your mouth .
i refuse to go to tgi friday 's in champaign anymore .
i 'm very forgiving when it comes to service .
however , truly bad service is inexcusable .
this is n't what bothers me .
it happens .
the food is alright , but nothing spectacular .
normally things here are ok - nothing fantastic .
the prices are also very reasonable .
very little to complain about with tgi fridays .
this is all on top of the ridiculous prices they charge .
i do not understand the reviews that say ` reasonable prices ' .
yes , the food is usually pretty tasty , but it is very overpriced .
almost $ _ num _ for _ num _ mozzarella sticks ?
friday 's when there are way better deals all around you ?
do not go here .
i love chain food but this place is awful .
i doubt i will ever go back to a tgi fridays at any location .
save yourself the time and money and avoid this place .
the store is a lot bigger , and their new crew is fantastic !
the food is .
i guess they were n't expecting local goat cheese buckwheat crepadillas .
the food is french , mostly crepes , and pretty tasty .
the wine and beer lists are also extensive and interesting .
i am pretentious and i love pretension .
no , seriously , it does .
the decor is amazing , however .
the portions are tiny , especially considering the prices .
beer selection is good , but also very overpriced .
as always , options are really creative , but more importantly , delicious !
carmon 's has quickly become one of my favorite eateries in c-u .
i mean , it 's a creperie , right ?
the fish special is worth having every time you go .
the seafood st jacques crepe is also consistently amazing .
i am such a huge fan .
i am stuffed , and stuffed with amazing food .
i do n't understand what is wrong with buckwheat crepes ?
i love them .
and that is what they avoid .
i have mixed feelings about carmon 's .
i highly recommend ordering this item !
the smoked salt that is used to flavor the butter is also spectacular .
there is an amazing amount of flavor packed into each grain of salt .
overall , i highly recommend carmon 's for breakfast .
this place is an absolute joke .
it 's extremely overpriced ( $ _ num _ for a solo ham and cheese crepe ?
i go there with my girlfriend to eat steak and crepes .
the food has been consistently good , and their specials are always interesting .
it gives a pleasant atmosphere to the place .
the place is clean and kind of cool with friendly service .
a great place to take your parents .
anyways , i definitely forget the name of the dish .
** a special thanks to matthew l. for helping with this review !
do n't expect me to come back here again .
i love carmon 's .
miss this place , and that cute lil redhead that works there too !
really yummy french onion soup -- it has a crepe in it !
this place definitely tries way too hard to be something its not .
this is not the case here .
i have never seen a restaurant that hires waitresses this horrible .
now heres the good part : thanks but no thanks .
we refuse to come to carmon 's ever again .
the ambiance is really nice - very shabby chic with some refined touches .
my husband says his was decent .
i do n't know why they could n't have used white flour .
i have not had any nightmare experiences like other diners .
i adore the bread with smoked salt .
the coffee ( with constant refills ) is excellent .
the pork crepe with fried egg is out of this world .
so is the crepe suzette .
definitely go for their specials -- they 've never let me down .
the service has always been pleasant .
you definitely have to bring out the pocketbook , but the food is quality .
enjoy !
price is the only reason i wo n't come back so often .
still love carmon 's !
love how they keep in interesting .
this is a small , shabby-chic french restaurant serving simple french food .
i recommend the salmon starter and specials .
i guess they only just started serving dinner as well as breakfast and lunch .
i 've always eaten them as desserts with chocolate and banana nutella .
the lunch crepes are great , and you can even build your own .
i definitely recommend at least trying it out !
he is an absolute hoot .
he definitely adds to the pleasurable experience .
i suspect we will return to carmon 's for brunch during our next visit .
carmon 's is a restaurant reminiscent of a small specialty restaurant in europe .
it is at its heart a creperie , and its crepes do not disappoint .
the food is good but the customer service is awful .
the service is wonderful .
i have always been seated right away and the servers seem happy to help .
they have a wonderful wine selection and the food is fabulous .
they have a variety of crepes and quiches .
there is always a special for the day .
carmon 's restaurant has closed .
but the space has been reincarnated as carmon 's bistro .
so look for reviews of carmon 's bistro !
do you have bored children on your hands ?
the orpheum can quickly take care of that !
it is a little rag tag compared to other children 's museums .
but the live animals usually get everyone interested !
i am not kidding .
these people are clueless .
it goes on and on .
for $ 9/person , you can surely do better than that .
do n't be fooled .
avoid this place !
i 've gone to places that r free and are cleaner than this one !
it 's such a gorgeous space , with many new exhibits .
it 's such a gorgeous space , with many new exhibits .
not sure if it 's a joke on us - or the kids .
dirty - everything is dirty and dusty .
plus - $ _ num _ to get in ?
huevos rancheros is another favorite of mine .
fyi-the lunch specials are yummy and a great price-check them out .
i 'm making myself want to go there right now just thinking about it .
next , the service is fast , friendly , and the food delicious .
howerver that 's when the good times stopped .
in fact , it may be my favorite restaurant in town .
they give you free chips with two salsas , one spicy and one mild .
this place has been very hit-or-miss with me .
the setting is always nice , especially with shady outdoor seating during the summer .
and they do chiles rellenos well .
parking lot cause the parking lot was full .
i particularly love the chimichangas .
i 'm a fan . ''
and i am , because this is one of my go-to restaurants .
fiesta cafe has the best mexican in champaign/urbana .
everything is n't made with the same ground beef , there are choices .
on a nice night , outdoor seating is fun .
great mexican beer selection and drink specials occur .
the food though , has much to be desired .
the chips are good and the salsa is n't too bad either .
good place to go if you 're just looking for ` ritas and chips .
i much prefer tortillas that restaurants make themselves .
as the saying goes : i 've got _ num _ problems .
getting the order wrong and forgetting a side ?
ruining tequila with a syrupy excuse of a marguerita ?
swapping the meats on my bfs platter ?
it has a nice attitude that feels very independent , spunky , and spontaneous .
four stars is for the the overall vibe - enjoy it for what it is !
another spot in champaign that seems like it has been open forever .
the building is made of adobe , with a great shaded outdoor seating area .
service is hit or miss , depending on how many people are here .
the food is very typical for this kind of joint .
that is it .
good for a nostalgic trip when visiting the family .
though nothing to go out of your way for .
excellent service , they serve chips and salsa too .
they have tons of tequila choices .
i read a few reviews about this place before i went .
i bet they are good .
i promise you i will not be going back .
too mad for them because , as i said , i love mexican food !
they have massively awesome margaritas , and are super vegetarian friendly .
food beats the hell out of the other mexican places in town .
i '' m a fan '' i guess that sums it up .
i dig the funky vibe of fiesta .
i use to come here in my early twenties and gorge out .
well ... i love this spot .
it 's a long standing tradition of downtown champaign .
i 'm a fan of the enchiladas , chicken/mole to be exact .
the staff is super as well .
they are pretty great .
i have made this dish better at home .
this place is great .
her margaritas are on point and her attitude is perfect .
she 's fun to work with and always has a smile on her face .
i love trying new things here ( which is rare for me ) .
love the cimichanga with a huge strawberry margarita at fiesta !
fun place to eat out and the chips and salsa are good as well .
i love amy tho !
amy is the best !
always run into people i know at this great place .
it 's a very friendly place with great food and awesome margaritas !
i love this place !
also amy is the best waitress !
as for the food , it 's not perfect .
i wish i had when i was a student .
my absolute favorite sit down mexican restaurant in town .
i hope i 'm not forgetting anything in there .
amy is the greatest server , but the rest are pretty good too !
also white cheese sauce with chorizo is very good .
i love coming here .
the food and the drinks are great !
it 's perfectly sweetened , very fragrant and smooth !
they do give a huge portions .
i think i will use the amtrak again !
when amtrak is good ... it 's really really good .
but when it 's bad , it 's terrible .
whenever i ride the saluki , it seems to get delayed .
amtrak needs to get its act together and i need to get a car .
unless you buy your tickets several weeks in advance .
i 've had _ num _ hour delays on amtrak !
chicago is a major travel hub and the closest major city .
the fact that it is so difficult to get to hurts the university .
sweden benefits enormously from having fast , relatively cheap , and hassle-free railway .
i 'm bragging now , but uiuc needs amtrak to shape up .
the delays have ranged from _ num _ hour to _ num _ hours .
this is the best way to get to and from chicago from champaign .
you can even walk around , and use a human-sized bathroom .
a night to never remember .
( same goes for the reverse process on our arrival back home . )
clean bathrooms , a subway and vending machines downstairs , very reliable wifi .
he 's incredibly helpful , funny , and sweet .
he 's just incredibly polite , and manners go a long way .
so amtrak , please read this and give him a raise !
those people are everywhere , that 's not amtrak 's fault .
i love taking the train whenever i come back home to champaign from chicago .
being flexible with times is also an advantage to getting a good deal .
i wish the guy in front of me would stop farting .
also another lady to my right smells like play doh .
recommendation : bring some odor eliminating plug ins or something this means you , the passenger , will most certainly be delayed .
regarding ticket prices , it competes with greyhound in terms of cheapness .
hence you pay less then a bus ticket if you plan accordingly .
the train itself is really nice and clean .
pick a nice smelling passenger to sit with and you 'll be fine .
the wifi sucks though and is not reliable in my opinion .
this station is one of the better ones i 've been to .
typically , they 're about an hour late .
one job and they have never been on time ... .
how can that be ?
time to reevaluate your business model .
my use of this amtrak station is very limited .
i actually have n't used it for the train .
i have been there to pick up friends from the train .
i like that this station serves many functions .
the train , city buses , and charter buses all stop here .
and they are located in different areas , which makes it easier to navigate .
when the greyhound arrives , they call out the bus information .
expect your train to be _ num _ minutes late .
the staff is super friendly and helpful .
the towing business can be a dirty business full of jaded and shady characters .
andy 's really is that rare and honorable small operator .
here 's to you , andy !
and thank you !
disclaimer : this is a review of sam 's cafe 's new evening menu .
the baklava is the best i 've ever had .
i 'm thrilled that we found this place ; it is a treasure !
do not leave sam 's without trying the pancakes .
sounds a little creepy , but it 's true .
go support local business !
i do n't recommend it .
nothing to brag about .
each meal comes with a choice of two meals .
in fact , i think the homous was their best food !
btw , warm pita bread keeps coming , which was a nice touch .
they have a really good breakfast special .
it is cheap and good .
i love french toast , it is my favorite breakfast food .
sam 's is the epitome of a greasy spoon .
seriously , the best french toast i 've ever had .
it is rich , crispy and seasoned with powdered sugar and cinnamon .
_ num _ bucks and change for two coffees , two specials and french toast .
sam 's is awesome for breakfast .
i have always wanted to try sam 's .
finally having a dentist appointment at _ num _ am ( ick ! )
i like that about the place .
i know . )
basically , it 's no-frills , straight up fast and cheap service .
and that 's refreshing .
: ) oh , and they do n't take cards .
bring cash .
it 's not like you 'll need a lot of it !
this is the breakfast place of my dreams !
i know , it 's not fancy .
now if it would only move toward urbana ... but who cares about that ?
the food is phenomenal !
be served at a way fancier place for way more money .
it 's one of c-u 's little gems .
french toast is amazing !
unpretentious , hole in the wall that is worth the drive .
cash only and bring change for the parking meters .
the french toast , oddly pancake style , is to die for .
also great to eat the ethnic food in the evening when available .
i 'm such a huge fan of hole-in-the-walls .
i have many regrets from my college career .
i get to experience two of my favorite words here : cheap brunch .
oh yes please gim me nao i want it i want it so bad .
footnotes : do not eat here if : - you are on a diet .
i do n't think the cooks know what that word means .
no lite butter or diet fat free bacon to be found here .
- you are a snob .
- you are a germaphobe ... .
snap out of it , take a class in immunology .
germs ai n't got nothin ' on you .
( sorry , bio nerd leaking through . )
do eat here if : - you are a broke-ass college kid .
- you love breakfast foods .
the french toast is particularly noteworthy .
it 's either _ num _ or _ num _ ... ) as good as a cheap and greasy breakfast gets .
very friendly staff , and it really feels like a neighborhood restaurant .
this is my favorite place for breakfast in champaign .
it is a comfort-food-greasy-spoon restaurant .
the food is very inexpensive and it has the best french toast in town .
the seats are quite uncomfortable but fit in with the ambiance .
i wish they would bring it back .
food is cheap , breakfast special is $ _ num _ and it runs all day !
i know i will be going again !
how is it so good ?
that 's a good question .
there are better-for-us breakfasts in champaign .
there are fancier breakfasts in champaign .
delicious , and a perfect serving .
sounds disgusting ?
trust me , it 's awesome .
the atmosphere is probably going to take a few visits to grow on me .
and the food is indeed good .
excellent service very honest waiter looks can be deceiving , and sams cafe is a classic example of that .
sams is my favorite place for breakfast in chambana .
a big reason for that is the french toast .
it is simply the best i have every had .
wait staff is friendly and efficient .
sams is definitely a diamond in the rough .
it is a small crowded place serving inexpensive and ok food .
but i think it is over rated in yelp .
i 'm a believer .
prices are great , i think a burger is under $ _ num _ !
i have never ordered anything other than french toast and hash browns .
the hash browns are darn good too .
side-note : they only take cash .
and it 's delicious melty american cheese , not oily coagulated cheddar .
and i swear these has browns are from scratch .
small place , so i can imagine it fills up fast .
the american fries are great , as is the french toast .
have heard so much about sam 's cafe and now wonder why .
it 's been a while since i left that much food on my plate .
of course , if you disagree you are obviously declasse .
but the thing i ca n't get over is the pancakes .
they are absolutely delicious .
plus , they have take out .
you get what you pay for but the food is cheap quick and easy .
there 's an _ num _ % chance that sam could be serving you .
say hi .
i 'm definitely never going back .
no clue how this has _ num _ stars .
i believe the owner dips the toast in pancake batter before frying it .
how cool is this guy anyway .
sam 's has the best pancakes i 've had in quite a while .
it 's your typical cafe , everything done the way you would want it .
do n't even bother with merry anns just come straight to sams .
they make everything to order ( duh ) .
sam and his family are some really hard working people and it shows .
what more can you ask for ?
i 've heard the french toast and pancakes are also great .
any kind of breakfast to be had .
environment is very shabby with some old chairs and tables .
but the price and the taste is amazing .
strongly recommend .
parking is kinda difficult sometimes and only takes cash .
the biggest flaw of this place is the extremely slow wait times .
there seems to be only one cook .
the staff is relatively amiable .
they talk about that customer as if she was in the wrong .
another problem are the extremely small tables .
its greatest strength are its really good prices .
their `` american '' fries is actually very soft hash browns .
this place is what it is .
if that sounds repulsive to you , do n't go !
if not , go and definitely have the french toast .
service is ok at best but wth ?
they have the best french toast .
the price is also very reasonable : ) everything including a milk for the daughter is $ _ num _ with tip .
service is awesome - everyone is super-friendly .
for now , make sure you keep an andrew jackson on ya !
sam 's cafe has great food at a reasonable price .
i have eaten there many of times and am always satisfied .
they have great lunch specials with a great at home feeling atmosphere .
the only downside is that the seating is very small .
they have a good amount of tables but they are tiny .
there are two reasons to come to sam 's : two , you want their breakfast special .
do your mouth a favor ( flavor ? )
sam 's cafe serves good breakfast food at reasonable prices .
and they use real butter .
there is like one server/busboy/cashier and he is awesome .
have always gotten breakfast , and the food has been wonderful every time .
i recommend sam 's cafe !
only down side is they only take cash , no credit or debit amazing breakfast !
the breakfast special is worth the price as the portions are fairly large .
try the french toast .
but that is where it begins and ends .
sam 's cafe is super cute-looking from the outside .
but that 's where the good stops .
but other than those two things , i see no positives about this place .
seems like that could be a possibility seeing that this place has _ num _ stars .
incredibly rude , clearly do n't care for customers or loyalty .
i do n't think we 'll be back .
the all day breakfast special is only $ _ num _ !
nice place to meet with friends , friendly staff and nice atmosphere : - ) ok enough of the rant .
absolutely love this place !
coffee is always hot and fresh and the french toast is to die for !
a must try every time i walk into sam 's i feel at home .
i hope it never closes .
sometimes getting back to basics can separate the good restaurants from the great restaurants .
this place is great .
that serves breakfast .
it 's super fast and just great classic breakfast .
it 's butter and has the crispy edges , clearly made with buttermilk .
they seem to soak it in butter with some maple syrup .
one less point for being cash only .
service is pretty friendly .
these guys are awesome .
i highly recommend them .
charlie is a very nice person .
thanks charlie .
nice place - on campus , but without a heavy illini feel .
they cook excellent burgers and fries , and the teriyaki chicken sandwich is divine .
the food is awesome too for bar food .
they have a great chicken sandwich with french fries .
add a tastey guiness to complete your meal !
they 've expanded so now there 's more room to groove .
when there are no sporting events .
ohhhh the murphyburger , how i loved thee .
extra pickles , please .
go murphy 's !
i still have dreams of wednesday lunch .
however , it is not .
the burgers are phenemonal , as is the bbq chicken .
this is my favorite bar on campus .
it is a solid pub where they serve cheap and delicious beer .
the food is decent , but not that great .
what could really improve this place is better music .
the jukebox is too susceptible to people with bad music tastes .
pros - fairly good specials - relatively low amount of bros - greasy ass delicious food cons - seating is terrible on the weekends after _ num _ - dirty looking , but not necessarily dirty .
go there on a weeknight to get the optimal experience .
honestly people do n't care about the atmosphere , do they ?
they just come for the booze .
they serve the typical junk food and it is very crowded during the weekends .
they have a few specials too , so do check those out .
and i 've had some of their deliciously fried , greasey appetizers , too .
food can actually be quite good , especially the kobe burger .
the crispy , but greasy , fries have slowly grown on me .
the beer selection is way better than any other bar on campus .
they now have some rogue ales , which are fantastic .
the jukebox churns out more and more horrifying music as people become intoxicated .
if you go here stick with weekdays .
on weekdays it 's actually a pretty nice place to hang out with friends .
can get very very crowded and absolutely nothing irish about it .
plus they have lots of seating for us lazies .
and have good , knowledgeable bartenders .
there 's a wide selection of beers - over _ num _ i believe ?
some of the stuff that comes out of that thing ... i do n't know , man ... =p the specials here are also pretty sweet - yay for logo glass night .
overall , it 's just a great campus bar to frequent anytime .
good beer specials , including $ _ num _ pints of point on fridays .
the fries are thin and decent , but need salt and ketchup .
good soups in winter , including a deceptively good beer cheese soup .
check it out .
cheap beers , and irish nachos are awesome .
a bar i spend a lot of time at .
sometimes the jukebox leads to very questionable music .
this is the best bar on green street .
i know that 's not saying much , but let me explain .
the drinks are cheap and really strong .
the staff is very accommodating and courteous .
one caveat : they have the nastiest -- nastiest bathroom .
it 's hideous .
a year later and i still loooove this place .
this is my favorite of all the campus bars hands down .
they also have loaded waffle fries that are awesome .
nah , just kidding .
but i have been to my share of irish bars .
i like murphy 's because it 's low-key and they have good drink specials .
the next thing i 've got to try here is the food .
murphy 's is the dive bar that we all kind of grew up on .
they have decent burgers and a fair selection of beers .
i head to downtown champaign for the weekends .
in addition , the food is delicious !
overall , this bar is chill and fun at the same time .
i 'm in ! )
the jukebox has some interesting selections , and the music is usually good overall .
well , it 's an institution here at the u of i .
you can get cheap brewskis and cheap burgers and neither are bad .
it 's usually crowded thursdays so i try to keep away .
as far as campus bars go , this is as good as it gets .
their beers on tap is great , especially for a campus bar .
it 's really fresh !
it 's quality and fresh !
man oh man these burgers are juicy and seculent .
the turkey burger is well flavored and succulent .
i love their spacious bench seat tables .
it 's a cherished favorite .
the location is great and the atmosphere is better than the other campus bars .
is it the best bar in champaign-urbana ?
the beers on tap are always good and remain pretty simple .
they always have specials too , which is nice .
i miss this place !
this is my choice for a beer and greasy pub-grub .
i sincerely doubt it did anything about the disgusting sticky floors .
much smaller than i remember .
i mean the place is n't exactly set up like panera .
i guess it just depends on the crowd .
it 's generally quiet enough for that during the week .
on weekends it 's certainly busier and louder , but not unpalatable .
if you are here for food , try the irish nachos .
i 'm a fan of this place .
murphy 's pub really is a great college bar .
the drink specials are quite good and the choices on tap are plentiful .
food is good for bar food , definitely get the irish nachos sometime .
there really is n't anything irish about them , but they are delicious .
fries are great !
they have great drink deals and good food too .
i recommend trying the irish nachos .
they have different specials everyday too .
either way , that was a bit annoying , so strike two .
the good news is their food is amazing .
why do you have such stars ?
folks , i highly advise you to pass this place up .
i have nothing but the fondest memories of murphy 's pub .
a fun yet relaxing college night , murphy 's is the place for you !
it 's all good , but not really outstanding .
sometimes it 's great and there are n't any problems .
but if it 's crowded things quickly go downhill from there .
it 's still good , but three stars seem more appropriate than four .
the food at murphys is solid .
the best nights at murphy 's are wednesdays and thursdays .
my cabinets are full of awesome logo glasses thanks to murphy 's .
thursdays are phenomenal because it 's $ _ num _ pints .
go out with a $ _ num _ bill and you 'll have an awesome night .
that simple , that 's all you need .
they have great drink specials and amazing irish nachos !
this is definitely the best bar on campus , hands down .
food is pretty good but sometimes its hit and miss .
i 've had great irish nachos and i 've had terrible irish nachos there .
service is terrible they are incredibly rude .
still reaching for my wallet bartender looks at _ num _ dollar tab with no tip .
3rd example usually the irish nachos are covered in toppings , most recent time hardly any .
can i get some more toppings please i did n't get very much .
guy looks at me like i just punched his mother .
answers slowly `` yeah ... i guess i can '' .
thank god i love this place .
and not all are bad , just most .
good times with friends and cheap beers , and that 's pretty much it .
the irish nachos is good to order with two more people .
however , the memories make the place and thats pretty much how murphys survives .
the one place where townies , undergrads and graduate students actually mingle .
the food is pretty good for campustown ; i like the burgers and fries .
what you go to murphys for is the beer .
and it 's not bad beer either .
one of my favorite places to have a beer in champaign .
irish nachos are a must if you 're hungry !
this is the best bar on campus .
i love murphy 's !
it has a great campus bar feel .
a beer for everyone here because their draft list is extensive .
nice to have a large group and sit down and shout out conversations .
and that 's a good thing .
murphy 's keeps things simple , cheap and fun .
i love watching drunk freshman share the plate of irish nachos , absolutely hilarious .
burgers are great , beers good enough for a campus bar .
exactly what you expect .
do you get the idea it was bad ?
skip it and save yourself a possible trip to the dentist .
nice bar to grab food and a beer at .
service from bartenders is mediocre .
atmosphere is irish-feeling but feels kinda meh nice selection of beer and they have green line on tap !
they make you pay up front for your food .
i 'm glad it was n't a problem .
being saturday and plenty of college games on but just not happening here .
let 's go , i 've seen enough .
a great place to have a good beer .
some reviewers seem not to like ordering at the bar .
boo hoo it 's not like a long walk .
beer deals are decent and pub food is very standard .
the bar is huge however , good to bring a big group .
overall , i like murphys .
the loudspeaker announcements though are just really annoying .
atmosphere : disgusting and not aesthetically pleasing .
it smells like dick cheese in here mixed with vomit and under dried towels .
i do not understand how this bar continues to exist .
they use gigantic glasses of mixer with a single standard shot .
_ num _ fl oz for a shot is the next level of low .
but _ num _ just leaves me speechless .
standard shot , you guys , is _ num _ fl oz .
that 's basically spiked sprite .
my point is , they have _ num _ drink craftsmanship .
which is fine since apparently you 're supposed to lower your standards on campus .
food : food service is poor though the food is fairly good .
i get it ... if i were working all night i 'd get hungry too .
oh man , this is a classic college dive bar .
i can not vouch or review the food as i did not partake .
there are no servers .
they then call your name over a pa system to the whole bar .
all in all this place is a dive .
if you want this type of thing , go for it !
five stars is probably due to some heavy nostalgia sentiment for me .
beyond that , they have delicious burgers and fries .
and it 's a more laid back alternative to kam 's or red lion .
still a good memory of being where my first legal us drink was .
food is exactly what would you expect from this place .
but , for what it is ?
it 's a heart attack waiting to happen so do n't order it alone .
it 's like an irish-style pub , lots of dark furniture and seating areas .
great bar for hanging out with colleagues .
there still killing the irish nachos .
the place is interesting and has a comfortable low key feel .
they have _ num _ beers on tap as i recall , pbr and high life .
huber 's ' pizza is way better .
service is great , and friendly .
i can definitely see this as a place to go back to .
the brass rail is what a dive bar should be .
every time i 've come i 've enjoyed it .
cheap hamn 's ( really , that is awesome ) and pabst .
they can make cheep frozen pizzas if you are really desperate for some food .
the place has been here forever , and it has not been updated either .
if that is your thing , this is right up your ally .
the selection of alcohol is pretty good .
why am i writing a review about my favorite bar ?
oh shit ... i '' m becoming part of the problem .
the deal is the rail is the shit .
and the owner is n't trying to become some tycoon .
he 's a pretty sweet older dude .
this is what rocks .
the beers pour nicely .
the booze is mighty fine .
this is to keep things real .
are you kinda chill , a bit outside the box ?
stop in .
are you a douche ?
eh , you still deserve a shot of fireball ... then leave .
the brass rail is a diaper .
i always end up being dragged here and i do n't know why !
the beer selection & seating are virtually non existent .
oh yeah , cash only and do n't expect much help from the bartender .
and i love that .
the older i get , the less i want to deal with people .
i am officially red from that 70s show .
who does n't love cheap beer ?
i mean ... .
anyway , very few beer selections but who cares .
you do n't go to the rail to be super snazzy .
it 's literally the epitome of the dive bar .
so take it as it is and stop complaining .
you 've got your regulars and they are all amazing .
in a skillet that can be gross .
overall , i like !
definitely a good brunch place for when you 're really hungry !
not to mention filling .
le peep is a solid breakfast/brunch spot , especially for champaign .
their menu has a nice variety , but nothing too exciting .
this is central illinois , after all .
those midwesterners love their grease .
sounds strange , but what a great idea to put granola in/on pancakes !
have always had a good experience and their food is delicious !
they also make wonderful smoothies .
their classic cubed potatoes are very very good .
their gypsy plate is fantastic .
however , there are things to improve on that need attention .
the dish says it is stuffed with seafood ... a total lie .
you can get it under $ _ num _ at walmart !
it 's reliable food , but nothing great or special .
you can also get flavored coffee , though with a few less options .
that 's just what i got .
le peep is mario from super mario bros. _ num _ .
that is why i never go back to le peep .
i love getting skillets for breakfast and the ultimate blt for lunch .
it 's pretty good , i have to say .
their sausage is also much better .
food is awesome !
french toast and peasant potatoes are delish !
do n't know why this joint is n't getting more love .
put that hollandaise sauce on my eggs ... .
their menu is huge and everyone i was with enjoyed their food .
the menu is extensive .
i find the less things on the menu , the better the food .
( concentrate your excellence , restaurants of the world ! )
substitutions are not a part of the extensive menu .
nothing special , but nothing to really complain about .
being a chain le peep is a know quantity and reliable .
wait staff was pretty good and friendly .
what breakfast brunch place does n't have a wait on sundays anyways .
definitely suggest this place for anyone in need of a good meal .
that 's when people go out for brunch !
the irish benedict is amazing .
my brunch motto is : everything with hollandaise sauce , hollandaise sauce with everything .
coffee is kept fresh and warm .
the food quality is not that great .
i personally get the eighteen wheeler - a lot for a good price .
& i like french toast .
they have amazing pancakes and omelettes/skillets .
they serve breakfast , brunch , and lunch .
they do n't serve dinner .
not so many breakfast places in champaign so it is what it is .
le peep is n't that place .
it fits well in the category of mediocre breakfast restaurants in champaign .
i 'm still searching for an exceptional breakfast expericence .
but breakfast is breakfast .
waits on weekend after maybe _ num _ .
cheese eggs are great !
i think you 're either a le peep groupie or you 're not .
i 'm not .
i 'll go there , and their food is alright , but nothing special .
pancakes are average .
service is quick and friendly though .
it 's a good find for breakfast in this small town .
had a bit of a wait -- went around 11 am on a weekend .
great french toast , very filling and tasty .
and long behold , this place does not disappoint .
not many restaurants can do that .
the best part about this place is probably the price .
also , there is nothing french about their omelettes .
i have n't tried the crepes so i ca n't give my opinion .
the eggs really need the hollandaise which is so unhealthy .
it 's quite an alright breakfast place .
it 's just a regular pancake house with better food quality .
i always order the blarney skillet with hollandaise sauce on the side .
the hollandaise sauce is actually the highlight of my meal !
basically anything from the skillet section is amazing .
expect ~ 30 mins wait on sunday !
holy cow , they have excellent food !
my personal fav is the blarney skillet sans peppers and onions .
it is the absolute bomb .
wait staff is friendly .
service is excellent .
i am back , and incredibly happy to be back !
i want to like le peep , i really do .
it just seems every time i go , something is n't right .
this is one of the best breakfast places i 've ever been been to .
their food is seriously yummy .
but the concept is very interesting .
it looks like a quaint kitchen , possibly decorated by your blind grandmother .
looks are n't everything .
they really know how to make a good skillet .
this is a solid low price breakfast place .
i like the mini omelets .
this is one of my favorite weekend breakfast stops .
the food is always top notch .
the eggs benedict is one of the best i 've had in town .
service is fast and friendly .
you never feel rushed .
but get there early , the place fills up fast and stays busy !
the staff are overly friendly and bring a smile everytime !
food is is always delicious !
and they serve food fast .
however , i 've had additional health problems and have identified more food allergies/triggers .
the potatoes are prepackaged and seasoned with onion powder .
onions have been identified as my biggest allergy .
i know with allergies/food triggers , we can be annoying customers .
the food is usually very good and the service is excellent .
le peep be mine # wcw definitely a nice little breakfast place with delicious food .
love having a water pitcher at the table .
and bring several friends with me !
i 've never met a bad wait-staff or hostess here .
also , grab a glass of the raw cider .
it 's intense .
absolutely love le peep the staff is friendly , but i just expect better food for the price .
the menu has a wide variety of breakfast foods .
first impression : ho ` dang that is a lot of food !
service is okay .
overall , not great , but not a place that needs avoiding .
great place to have breakfast .
i love cooking but once in a while i crave for breakfast in bed .
i usually like to decide my menu beforehand .
but now since i have gone many times , i have taken a few .
try the wanderer skillet !
la peep does everything right .
they even offer you a coffee to take home when you leave !
the waitstaff is always friendly , knowledgeable , and pleasant .
people often say `` everything i 've ordered from here has been good . ''
well , everything i 've ever had at la peep has been fantastic .
the presentation is spotless .
every plate is beautiful .
they 've never messed up my eggs .
basically , la peep is the perfect brunch spot .
this place is awesome .
this is my new favorite place in the cu area .
this are the best pancakes that i ever had !
there breakfast is great , low price with tons of food , nice food .
all are nice , especially the omelette , enough soft egg flavor .
very good service and wonderful atmosphere this is the real deal - a little italy in itself .
i love the chicken capperi - the wine sauce is incredibly delicious .
prices are good , food 's good .
all i want are fresh ingredients , toothsome pasta , and freshly-grated parmigiano-reggiano ... ana 's review is spot-on .
only the fact that this place is so cheap keeps it afloat .
i love manzella 's !
in addition , the prices are very reasonable and the staff is really friendly !
i usually take at least 1/2 of it home for later .
the pizza is awesome too !
the food and service are great and consistent !
: ) ps : for those cold , snowy nights , they also deliver !
the portions are big but are slightly pricey .
i loooooove this place !
very nice with a cute , homey , warm , dining room .
love the ranch salad dressing !
everything on the menu is yummy .
i usually get the cheese filled ravioli and they are superb !
i have never had a bad meal or experience here .
my boyfriend and i love it .
food is about what you 'd expect from a central illinois italian restaurant .
the place smells dirty .
the decor is 70s kitschy , and that 's okay .
my family has been coming here for years .
i remember having my little league banquet here when i was _ num _ or _ num _ .
this place has not been updated since the _ num _ 's , and it shows .
the service is fast and friendly .
food comes out quick as well .
manicotti is bland , except for the overly sweet sauce .
canned sardines , the pasta is probably not freshly made .
saying all that , this place still has a special place in my heart .
though i wish dom 's was still open ... get the italian beef sandwiches this place is ahh mazing !
the boy eddie that works there is so sweet and nice and cute .
do n't know if they had another menu for dinner .
restaurant has n't changed in more than thirty years and is very dated .
the food is generally good , and service is average .
all in all i do n't know what we will ever go back .
i am in hopes the owners eventually make me want to return .
and i love it .
everything on the menu is delicious and the service is usually very good .
the meatball sandwich is great too .
ok , let 's talk about the meal .
that just is n't possible ! ''
so then the bill comes .
sadly , none of that is true now .
for that i give them _ num _ stars .
this is a very old-fashioned menswear store .
they have regular sales on most or all of their items , including suits .
i have purchased items as gifts and my fiance has bought some suits here .
when it comes to customer service , perhaps they need a refresher course .
they also have a small table of fair-trade coffees and chocolates .
it is a cute little store with very unique items .
as a result the prices are fairly high .
cool stuff and helping the world be a cooler place , two thumbs up !
: ) fair trade offerings make unique gifts .
this is akin to grassroots in anchorage .
around christmas , there are so many beautiful , handmade decorations .
additionally , they treat female customers with respect .
i can not recommend this business enough .
great place to get a quick oil change .
cool shop , too , as far as oil change places go : ) get in , get out .
i 'll definitely be back next time i 'm due for an oil change .
highly recommend !
great place to get a quick oil change .
they 're always friendly and always very quick with what you have them do .
i 'm pretty good at that game , so they are really quick .
the manager is very knowledgeable and the stuff clean my car like new !
highly recommend !
i 've come here now _ num _ times .
the service here is great .
no bs they do what you ask and not try to up sell stuff .
plus there is never a line and they are quick .
dom 's has been around for years .
dom 's is far superior to many of the other italian restaurants in town .
dom 's has closed ?
you 're killing me !
does anyone have their recipes ?
oh , please .
please excuse me now while i gnash my teeth and rend sackcloth .
an old-school place that has now closed .
so keep an eye out for butitta 's !
woo !
they have beautiful arrangements at fair prices .
hours are 9-5 m , w-sat .
now we 're married .
this shop is closed .
so it 's a draw .
it 's weird .
even though no one else likes this place .
i 'm a big fan !
can we say cheap but super yummy mojitos ?
how awesome is that ?
barfly makes no sense .
i mean , who are you trying to attract ?
are you trying to get the pseudo-cosmopolitan crowd that drink classy martinis ?
the townies trying to look elegant ?
the drinks are great .
it 's closed !
thank goodness !
gallo miller 's people are friendly , knowledgeable , and helpful .
better still , their work is excellent .
and my car looks like new .
they are booked several weeks out , but worth the wait if you can .
it is obvious that they really care about the customer , how refreshing !
super fast considering they replace the whole passenger side of my car ... great job , and thank you gallo-miller .
that is what i wanted , and it 's what they delivered .
as is , that there burger is lethal , my friend .
please .
i 've never eaten at hardee 's .
i 've been to hardee 's twice .
i 've been avoiding it ever since .
boyfriend finishes eating basically as soon as i sit down .
this is normal .
friend b finishes her meal .
by now it 's been ten minutes .
i check my receipt .
it 's been fifteen minutes .
my friends need to get back to work .
i flag down the next passing employee , who happens to be the manager .
i ask him what had happened to my food .
manager disappears , comes back three or so minutes later .
i tell him to cancel my order and give me a refund .
i really love the taco bell on neil .
aside from not having any dressing the salad itself is warm .
i prefer a crisp cold salad like most people .
however , the ring of onion on it is very hot .
this hardee 's always has nice staff well whenever i have been there .
from my vantage point i question the cleanliness of this restaurant .
thank you .
sign up online for coupon i.e.e free drink/fries with thickburger purchase _ num _ .
download the app to earn points toward free food their chicken tenders are off the hook .
i only drive through and i 've found the service to be consistently good .
nope just to lazy to change it .
that also had only one car ... this is a litltle after _ num _ pm .
i like that they fries were cut unpeeled .
but i still love it .
and i always get sad because it is so gross in there .
none of these other reviews do justice to this bar .
this is the best spot in downtown champaign overall .
blind pig has more character and better drinks .
but historically , mike murphy has the goods .
the place is not filthy , it 's just not clean .
it 's not meant to be clean .
this place is grand .
( what 's on then anyway ?
curling ? )
makes up for the cheap beer , i guess .
nothing beats it on a summer night with a group of friends .
mike & molly 's is my home base in champaign .
and then there is the music .
the beer prices are on the wall , so they stay the same .
it means someone is adding a little extra on for themselves .
they have drink specials sunday - thursday , but none for the weekends .
the place has a good dive feel , dark but not terribly seedy .
the other bars in town smell better and have a good enough selection .
even if the improv had n't rocked , there 's still karaoke after !
what 's not to like ?
all in all , it 's a solid place for sure .
the atmosphere is casual and vey relaxed .
great hang .
it 's a nice , comfortable , homey kind of bar .
monday nights they have karaoke , which can also be a great time .
they have an epically awesome beer garden in the summer .
sometimes , they have live music upstairs which is hit or miss .
they have a lot to offer !
check this place out .
prices are good and there 's an excellent scotch/whisky selection as well .
your mileage may vary depending on how much you like local music .
it 's strange and offputting and also makes the place reek of desperation .
the specials are quite cheap between sunday and wednesday .
my only gripe is that the beer garden could use better lighting .
mike n molly 's has an excellent beer selection , an excellent whiskey selection .
it is perfect for coming in really any ( or every ? )
their beer garden is excellent .
sometimes a dance party happens .
free admission on mondays , because it 's karaoke night .
( no , that does not mean i drink too much . )
they usually have some live music a few times during the week .
the beer and service is good .
quality is not bad .
there are a handful of taps .
things rotate , but i have found port , founders , goose island etc .
overall a nice place to relax and have some good beers with friends .
this is one of those places that i wish i went to more often .
this is a great spot for spring and summer .
this is my go to place , i love it here .
mondays and tuesdays are my favorite , comedy and kareoke night whoo whoo !
huge beer garden , they hold lots of shows out there in the summer .
they also have really awesome djs .
devon is a really fun bartender , lots of spunk .
the drinks are cheap anyway !
the same beers just up the road in chicago are 8-9 bucks !
keep up the good work mike n molly 's !
this place is ideal in the summer when there are outdoor shows .
they also have a decent selection of beer and liquor .
they do n't serve food which can be annoying for an early evening show .
they also have some fresh , ready-to-eat items like salads , samosas and baklava .
they 're pretty similar to the other international food store .
i usually just visit whichever one is least out of my way .
this is the smaller of the two , with overall a slightly smaller selection .
also , there are weekly sales ( saturdays i believe ) on their cheeses .
i really miss euro mart .
they do the whole massage , filing , cuticle trimming , etc .
their polish selection is basically limited to opi .
this place is totally overpriced , and they 're sloppy .
also , the massage chairs suck .
i have been to millennium nails several times .
never go here !
they are rude and do a horrible job .
it is jagged and a different color and it looks terrible .
my right hand nails are longer than the left .
i said , i like it just the way they are ( rounded ) .
it 's aggravating but it 's a first world problem , right ?
i 'm do n't giving this place a chance .
they do not sterilize the tools between customer uses .
if you go to this place you 're going to get an infectious disease .
i 've been going here for _ num _ years !
they are great .
i love them and highly recommend them .
this place is completely shady and horrible .
my friend 's experience is what really baffled me though .
all in all , a worthless place to go and get your mood spoilt !
save your money .
go somewhere else .
elegant nails on south neil has the same prices with superior services .
the sandwiches and burgers are very heavy and caloric .
beer and wine selection are not huge .
the food is pretty good too !
low-key place that 's good for drinks or a meal .
bartender and servers are late-20s age and very charming .
that goes for all dishes , actually .
this place has killer nachos , and usually pretty good servers .
lots of eye candy abounds .
my usual place to watch sports .
former coke bottling plant building in town , tastefully redone .
i have more tattoos now , but my first is still my favorite .
the color has held up nicely over almost _ num _ years .
they host good music concerts , and david sedaris has appeared .
older theatre but it still does the job !
oh wait ... that does seem kinda like a bromance/man-date .
a 150-foot screen that shows classic films monthly in their original frame size .
they have great concessions , cheap tickets , and an original wurlitzer organ .
really fun theater to go to .
lovely old theater -- so glad it 's been restored and maintained !
the staff is always courteous and helpful .
a variety of shows is sure to please all types of community members !
a nust see !
i am not always a big fan of arirang .
somehow i find that their food is kinda bland .
but surprisingly there 's lots of koreans eating at this place .
oh well , i am not korean .
what do i know ?
= ) i 'm a huge fan of the combination bulgogi plate .
i 'm getting hungry for some right now .
too bad i 'm two hours away ... * sigh * the food 's decent , but i 've never been impressed by this place .
i see this is a trend with the korean restaurants in campus town .
so first things first , they do n't accept cash .
my , we need to get with the times people .
so i order one of the specials , which is tofu soup and fish .
so yeah , the food is okay , not too bad .
i do n't know .
maybe there are n't too many korean restaurants around here ?
a-ok - three stars - seems about right .
`` a-ri-rang '' is the most popular and best-known korean folk song .
a-ri-rang is an ancient native korean word with no modern meaning .
` ari ' means `` beautiful '' ; ` rang ' can mean `` dear '' .
he always has the tv blaring on headline news .
but the food is good , maybe the best korean on campus .
this is no small feat in a university town hosting _ num _ native koreans .
when i 'm on campus , this is where i like to eat .
if you want korean soup or fried rice , go here .
this is a low key campus joint so what do you expect ?
food is pretty good , though rather pricey for a campustown restaurant in my opinion very good soup and fish dishes .
each place has their own specialties .
i love getting the bibimbap and bulgogi from here .
in my opinion , the soon du bu does n't have much flavor .
l i give it _ num _ stars because of what i get for the price .
every dish comes with at least _ num _ side dishes of kimchi .
try the bulgogi dishes and the budae jigae .
also try the omu rice .
it 's their version of omelet fried rice .
in fact , what do you expect at a no-waiter restaurant ?
you do n't have to pay tips already .
cheap and hits the spot .
i think it 's one of the most affordable korean restaurants on campus .
for a college kid , it 's a huge win .
i think the omu rice here is pretty clutch too .
it depends what dish you ordered .
i personally recommend soup # _ num _ budae-jigae .
and the fried fish is also good .
this is my korean staple on campus .
i always get the budae jjigae .
be warned , it is huge .
they make great kimchi as well , especially the potato variety .
give it a try and fall in love with the spicy soups .
the boss trying to sell me something they want to sell , which sucks .
and the food is very low quality in all the korean restaurant .
i have had .
looking for korean food ?
want budaejigae ?
the market itself is a war zone .
every day , there is always a lunch special going on .
and it is most definitely worth every penny !
i adore the budaejigae here !
if you must order something , get that .
you can also choose the level of spiciness of the broth .
they have a nice laminated menu at the desk to chose your entree .
prices have gone up according to my wife since she was in college .
food is decent .
serving time is mediocre at best .
price is somewhat higher than expected .
daily special number _ num _ is the way to go !
it comes with half a mackerel , and a decent bowl of tofu soup .
the mackerel can be dry at times though .
the kimchi jjigae has a large portion and tastes good too .
the food here is reasonably priced with a large portion .
waiting time is a little big long -- it often takes more than _ num _ minutes i tried out their bibimbap and it was fairly average .
not much else to say here .
the food is fairly average , it 's not that great .
the owner is very nice and the place is fairly clean .
chances are , the fine folks at natural gourmet can help you out .
located just west of biaggi 's , natural gourmet is easy to find .
she 's amazing !
they also have an amazing selection of food items , particularly baking supplies . )
no place is perfect , and ng does have a few cons .
produce selection is very limited , to the point of being almost nonexistent .
this is my go-to place for organic and pastured meats .
i like the noodle soups especially .
the mussleman curry chicken with egg is a must try .
the flavor is outstanding .
i 'm hooked !
if you can handle the spice do try the basil beef too !
help , i 'm addicted .
go out and support this wonderful locally owned business .
they know their supplements and food in and out .
they carry the best brands in the industry .
hmmm what to say about this chevy 's .
so , not good for the tipping there .
if you want to sit in the bar you can go right ahead .
i 've been craving another one ever since we went !
looking forward to going back .
all the way through , chevys is a delicious meal .
the entrees are great .
anything 's good , but in particular , i want to recommend the flautas .
also , make sure you get the yellow corn stuff .
but , it 's delicious .
you need it .
i do n't care that this is a chain .
all of the menu items i 've tried there have been amazing .
it 's always friendly service , and they 're very accommodating .
the prices are good as well .
never has a restaurant left more of an impression on me .
i am talking the pasty orange processed shit , pun fucking intended .
that 's _ num _ cents an ounce .
apparently `` smothered '' burritos actually means fucking coated with nacho cheese .
you can tell i really hate this shit .
let 's move on .
not joking .
i think .
i do n't blame him .
i come for the corn cake .
it 's good , but , like , ok good .
that sauce is awesome .
they also have a tortilla maker as well .
well , where to begin ... .
yuck , this place has really gone down hill .
business is closed as of the end of november _ num _ .
this place is closed , and for good reason .
you kind of have to treat legends this way , like a fresh puppy .
it 's a science and they have the titration juuuuust right .
the fries are awesome too .
good university crowd to go along with all the university memorabelia on the walls .
surprisingly , this is more than the college bar .
the food is served fresh and fast , and the prices are moderate .
drinks/food are pretty cheap .
thinking about legends brings back so many college memories ... tear .
it 's always wheel chair accessible which is great .
there 's few places on campus that are .
it is a big yawning space , with marginal food and service .
guess i am old school on this one .
go illini !
i hope they still have magic hat on tap .
yet another sports bar that 's on campus .
do n't get the mushroom soup here even though it sounds awesome !
honestly , this is the same as most any other bar .
good place to get a table and hang out .
an extra star because they sell playing cards for a buck .
solid sports bar i think .
the employees have always been very nice .
the portion is huge also !
i am a legends fan .
thursday thru saturday they have a dj so you can make requests and such .
i just wish their kitchen was open later .
legends has food ?
how come i did not know this ?
they make a fabulous sex on the beach .
the drink prices are reasonable .
the noise level is tolerable .
the large area does make it enjoyable for happy hours though .
the drink prices are reasonable for campus and amazing when compared to chicago .
their half off appetizer deal on fridays is pretty sweet too .
love it love it .
i 've had many a fun night here .
food - taco salad , how i love thee .
i have n't found a taco salad in the city that compares .
it 's huge and actually has a lot of lettuce !
i want to like legends more .
however , the hamburgers are a bit weak .
also i do n't think the burgers come with fries .
i am nothing if not magnanimous .
never any cover , legends is always crowded on weekend nights .
it 's like getting your scrotum caught while zipping up your fly .
it 's like watching schindler 's list during a bachelor party .
it 's like clogging the toilet at your girlfriend 's parent 's house .
be careful what you ask for at this popular campus town location .
do n't go to legends to drink .
we try and go there for the best fish sandwich in town !
be sure and order the beer batter onion rings also .
a pay parking lot is right next door .
i 'm seriously confused .
do some of the idiots reviewing legends know which bar is actually legends ?
im a regular there and have been for the past year and a half .
they 've never had _ num _ dollar long islands esp not on thursdays .
oh and their fish sandwich is great .
i am a big fan of the stepnpull in the women 's bathroom .
it 's always hard to get the attention of the bartenders .
beer is n't great and it 's relatively expensive for what it is .
they also have a terrible patio in the back .
on top of that the food is n't really very good .
so it fails at being a bar and sports bar .
it 's a bar - bar food , beer , booths and stools .
the food is actually quite good .
not to mention the utter lack of life on a friday night .
do so .
i cant stand this bar .
it takes forever to get a drink .
they only pour beer !
i want to punch that guy so bad .
i am so glad me and my friends do n't go here often .
i strongly suggest pickingmurphys over this abomination of terrible service .
never go here .
the patio is a decent size and appealing when it 's nice out .
the prices are about campus average and the tap selection sucks .
definitely my go-to if i feel like drinking on campus without being heavily annoyed .
strawberry is the best ` flavorita ' .
i can not comprehend how their burgers were ever voted best in champaign .
i 've never seen so many polo shirts and khakis in one venue .
the big pro is the location in campus town .
the big con is the food .
the cheeseburger at legends is a typical bar-style burger .
on the other hand , it 's still a college bar .
but it 's my favorite and thus _ num _ stars .
and , i have to say , the beer selection 's pretty good actually .
but you really go to legends for the atmosphere .
their food is actually pretty decent .
not overly amazing but pretty good as far as bar food goes .
go early .
this is def a day drinking bar .
i 'm torn about legends .
beer selection is okay , though .
it is my favorite bar on campus .
however , the service has been horrible lately .
my personal choice of burger is the works burger .
it 's not great , but still better than burgers from joes or murphys .
well i ca n't remember but i 'm sure there were plenty .
their loaded fries are bomb and the fish sandwiches are definitely worth the waits .
it really seems like they have everything here .
they do have hooked deals from time to time which is a nice touch .
their burgers are also really enjoyable .
the burgers and fries here are actually very good .
and the loaded fries are always a good idea .
the nachos are worth it too !
way to go legends looking for a spot to eat on my weekend adventure in champaign .
it 's a very spacious bar with tables along the walls .
i wish i would have ordered two of them it was so good .
why five stars you ask ?
and why review a hooters in champaign when i live in chicago ?
hooters also leaves the `` tips '' on its wings too .
i do n't recommend anyone go to the champaign hooters .
instead , go to buffalo wild wings - waaaaay better !
only drawback is the price , they are pretty expensive .
plus they are easy on the eyes .
i love hooters !
everything tastes fine , just missing some texture .
even jus finding this place ( located behind hardee 's ) is difficult .
it 's as if hooters took over a previous establishment not big in business .
; ) only 3 * for mediocre-ism food is just like other sports bars .
not a fan of the wings i 'm a woman so i ca n't go higher than a _ num _ ... .
set up is a little awkward .
better wings than i 've had at other hooters .
one of the better hooters i have been to in the midwest !
hooters wings are the same wherever you go .
they are not realising that how bad they are .
i love the wings and he loves the grilled cheese !
we always have a blast when we visit !
all of the waitresses we have had have been wonderful .
thank you !
you can tell he is very knowledgeable and experienced .
his prices are also very reasonable .
also , he is located in suite _ num _ , not _ num _ .
our appointment is at 3:30 and i ca n't wait .
quality : glenn is fantastic in what he does .
price : the deals offered are great , especially if you are a student .
i feel like i am receiving my money 's worth every time .
he puts on some very soothing spa music that really accentuates the mood .
glenn is super professional and do everything to accommodate his clients .
the massage is great .
very relaxing !
glenn has the magic touch to make all the pains disappear !
glenn has a lot of training and experience .
he offers a variety of different kinds of massages and therapy .
i definitely recommend this restaurant .
what a let down !
so many lovely memories of going here twice a week ( at least ! )
excellent owners and staff with a very inviting and unique environment .
she remembers all of their names , and greets and hugs their kids too .
this place is great .
not only that , but they are very accommodating .
this place is great .
goooo heeeeereee om nom nom ... the first difficulty i had with peking garden is ordering .
they do not have a website and it is not easily found online .
i realize that the standards for chinese food in this town are extreeeemely low .
i 've never had such a horrible and disgusting excuse for fried rice .
effing gross .
i love spicy food .
we do n't even go there that often !
what else is there to say ?
we are pretty sure it was from the egg drop soup .
i 've never dined in , only carryout .
just walk on over and i have a bag full of delicious warm food .
i wont be going back !
i come here for lunch occasionally , and the food is pretty decent .
what a great memory and way to connect with your customers !
the general tso 's is pretty good , although not outstanding .
it 's pretty much a party in your mouth .
and the delivery service is great .
i 'm definitely coming back .
i have had delivery from peking garden a few times .
it is life sustaining , but not much beyond that .
the portions are huge ... be advised !
it reminds me of the many neighborhood chinese places all up and down manhattan .
this place offers solid authentic chinese food .
i wish i could rate _ num _ stars .
i have been a regular of this place since _ num _ .
but man , these people can cook !
reminds me of chinatown in chicago il happy times !
ok yes , it is a little shady .
but hot damn is it my guilty pleasure .
drinks are totally from _ num _ 's .
this is our favorite chinese place in town .
we recommend this highly .
the good : - their egg rolls are very good too .
we 've been there couple of times .
great soups and love the steamed dumplings .
give it a try .
i 'm a regular there for lunch .
they 're friendly and serve good food .
the lunch menu is also very affordable .
it 's just a lot of extra food i do n't need .
i 've never been disappointed .
delicious chinese food in a town where there is a lot of competition .
the orange beef and chili chicken are both excellent dishes .
definitely need to be cleaned though , the restaurant is dirty .
two small complaints i have are the soy sauce and fortune cookies .
servings are small compared to other chinese restaurants .
- super nice service - good food - good portions - good variety - good for groups - interior of the store is cozy , clean , and well done cons : - food can be oily , but to be honest those particular dishes are oily anywhere - the americanized dishes are n't that good in my opinion not that big of an issue .
i work downtown so this is my goto asian lunch spot .
also , the owners and staff are very friendly .
3/5 i 've grown tired of these cookie cutter chinese takeout places .
peking garden is a throwback to how i remember real chinese food .
love the food here !
i love trying new things and i live nearby .
so far every choice has been a great success !
try their eggplant ( yes , eggplant ) dish .
our go-to , favorite place to have chinese food !
the spicy chicken [ # _ num _ ] is a must-try !
the owners are vert nice too .
potstickers-get them .
i 'm there !
daily specials are good too .
things i 've tried : all of the daily specials - all tasty and what you 'd expect .
the pitas are grilled instead of just warmed .
to top it off , the owner is a nice guy .
now that 's good service : ) delicious hot dogs .
the only place i 'd like to have hot dogs is in here !
and yeah , you can get a glimpse of cnn headlines while there .
but you have to clean after yourself .
it has everything from frozen cheesecake on a stick to tamales to gyros .
this place is great - the owner is the nicest guy as well .
my favorites are the vienna footlong and italian .
the polish is really mediocre though .
the fries are the best part .
the owner may seem mean , but he is one cool guy .
he only accepts visa or mastercard .
and even then , there is a _ num _ cent charge .
ask for extra sport peppers !
it sounds like people are upset because of no sesame seed buns .
they 've also switched peppers .
be aware if you do n't want any kick !
fries are freaking awesome as always , hot and crisp .
he runs a great place with pride that many eateries lack .
it 's the perfect lunch place .
especially if you are tired of the overpriced crap in the union 's basement .
btw , the owner has always been nice to me ... a reasonable place for decent food at a cheap price .
something about the ambiance of the place puts me off though .
i 'm always amused by the cast of characters who work at wonderdogs .
i effing love wonderdogs .
on top of that , the food is fast , cheap , and delicious .
thanks wonderdogs , for putting up with ridiculous , hungry graduate students .
: ) is that ok ? ''
so kudos to him for being accomodating .
and they ask you to have a seat and walk it out to you .
the pita is crispy and oily .
i like the collection of frocks and outerwear .
also the accessories are fun .
and the vintage frames are great !
a surprising amount of my wardrobe favorites are from dandelion .
( that i miss dearly ! )
the best thrift store i 've been to outside a major city .
i rarely leave without finding something i love ( and have to have ! )
eighties blouses are true polyester eighties blouses .
there are obscure labels and strange finds .
there are boots to match in the corner , you know .
no wonder they 've been around so long .
standouts : red corduroy flares that fit like a glove .
the prices for sell/trade are fair .
however , i find hipster douchebags amusing , not annoying .
i have about _ num _ pair from there .
luckily , dandelion also has dressing rooms , unlike some used clothing shops .
i do n't know i just was n't that impressed .
maybe it 's hit or miss ?
i love stopping by here once every one or two weeks .
they always seem to get in new finds .
( i am a goodwill pro , too ) .
there is a good mix of truly vintage and newer items as well .
this place is filled with awesome fun old things !
and it 's even clean !
it smells nice , they have the incense i like .
their hours are more reasonable than carrie 's .
what i do n't like : their organization .
organizing by color ... why ?
some of their clothes are literally falling apart and still marked at full price .
i 'm a thrift-store dweller .
worth noting : they have better hours than most vintage shops or thrift stores .
they 're just doing their thing , guys .
tumble inn , stumble out .
the outdoor area is a plus too .
this bar is nothing short of amazing .
everyone i 've ever introduced to this bar has loved it !
it 's close enough to campus apartments to walk there and stumble home .
everyone here is super friendly , and it 's a nice in-between campus/downtown spot .
the bartenders ( chester especially ) are great and the company is good .
a timeless gathering place is their mantra , and oh so true .
ti is an unbelievable dive bar .
i love to hang out there especially at the end of the night .
my sister , wife and illini niece loved it !
next year i 'm setting the golden tee record !
though that is just my picky tastes .
that is best as i can put it .
do n't forget that everyone stumbles out for good reason ... my favorite bar , hands down , in the c-u area .
no frills or thrills , just a great place to hang out .
we have so much fun when we visit .
it 's a great place to hang with friends and watch a game .
in addition , laser does not have any effect on white hair at all .
the office is nice and very clean .
you mileage may vary .
bob evan 's in champaign il is very good .
give that one a try .
the facility is immaculate , and the environment matches as well .
this bob evans is a hidden gem in this little town .
a solid breakfast choice if you are in the area .
sometimes , you just want breakfast .
i get that .
the pancakes are pretty good , but they 're huge .
i can barely finish half of them even when i 'm really hungry .
everything i 've tried has been pretty good , though nothing outstanding .
cleanest kitchen i have ever seen !
love the fresh dinner rolls and the orange juice .
i always like the meatloaf , mashed potatoes and green beans .
it 's just ok .
how is this place empty ?
if you do n't want to wait in line this is the place .
i highly recommend giving it a shot .
this particular establishment has similar lay out as all others .
banana bread is great !
everything else ranges from okay to awful .
champaign public library does n't hold a candle to the urbana free library .
either way , the two libraries are on the lincoln trail system .
it 's truly wonderful .
unless you 're looking for brand spankin ' new releases .
at the cpl , you can rent a dvd for $ _ num _ .
keep it for an entire week .
when i move , i 'm going to miss the free dvd rentals .
tip : be careful where you park .
most of the spaces are tiny and jam-packed with cars inches from one another .
this is the fanciest library i 've ever seen !
my favorite things about this library are : - plenty of seating .
there are even quiet rooms if you need the extra silence .
i 'm still trying to get him interested in the actual books though .
they also have story time in a separate room there .
the rainbow lights of the librarian 's desk also entertain my son .
i 've never seen anything like it .
you do n't have to park or get out of your car .
i 'm in this library as i type .
it 's the fourth time since it 's been remodeled .
plenty of large tables to get down and dirty with calculus on .
there is a cafe .
the audio visual rental selection is quite large too .
here 's a review .
the building is so cool and modern inside .
the instructors are so talented .
they sing and read books to our babies .
they also bring toys for them to play with .
my little girl loves it !
and loves to be with the other babies as well .
this library is amazing !
the kids area is awesome !
their media section is also huge .
check out is fast and easy with the `` self checkout '' stations .
it 's the best library i have ever been to - seriously .
it 's a beautiful building with plenty of space and friendly staff .
i just have to prove i live here ... hm ... i absolutely love this library .
no doubt they are one of top _ num _ libraries in the country .
looks aside , the library is filled with everything a bibliophile could hope for .
computer terminals at all the right places for catalog searching .
huge tables and quiet areas for studying and researching .
a small cafe downstairs to supply a book 's best companion - coffee .
great place to pick up movies and books and relax .
it 's nice to get off campus and see `` real people '' .
one drawback is noise level .
loud cellphone conversations are as common here as anywhere .
this place is the worst .
to excite people about reading and give free access to all .
also , they have a rather fantastic collection of cds .
big tables are great for spreading out .
also : wifi is free , but only if you have a library card .
not sure how it works if you do not have a library card .
i love the library .
- tons of window light - cafe with tasty treats and lattes - free wifi - lots of table space - great book selection - lots of dvds/bds other towns residents can also use the library with some restrictions .
in summary , a place to go for everyone , rich or poor .
sure the building is somewhat pretty .
however , that does n't make up for the rude service .
they are constantly hovering around groups .
the library is slowly losing it 's funding and not making much profit .
i now understand why .
this is a wonderful library !
i love that you can rent dvds and cds for free .
the employees are always very helpful and informative .
let me list them here _ num _ .
it is super easy to get a card .
you hop on a computer and put in your information to obtain a card .
electronic resource galore : they have zinio , hoopla for online movies and cd rental _ num _ .
computer stations everywhere and in the kids section they allow video games to be played _ num _ .
large library catalog , you can find likely anything here _ num _ .
i 've been a loyal cpl goer for many years .
the library has so many benefits for families and individuals .
the children 's book selection is enormous .
the checkout is a breeze with the electronic tags found in every book .
there 's always been someone there to ask questions if needed .
they are rude to their customers and act way more important than they are .
the gentleman that works on the children 's department is amazing .
my 4yo daughter loves when he does story time .
the reading programs keep my daughter wanting to come back every week .
prices on-campus are comparable to the rest of campus properties .
_ num _ cats are ok in most places , no dogs .
slow to plow parking lots , but perpetually mow in the summer .
washers and dryers in the complex sometimes work , usually do not .
also , outside and inside lights are quite frequently not working .
you end up with pitch-dark hallways and cul-de-sacs .
apartment showings - _ num _ days a week people walk through your place .
i agree with jenna m. - barr real estate is terrible !
what i have a beef with is their assessment of cleaning upon moving out .
that is outrageous and appalling .
here 's my experience from moving out of a barr apartment .
before moving out they give you a move out checklist .
in my google web albums , please decide for yourself .
this is not an uncommon example , as you can see from other reviews .
authuser = 0 & feat = directlink mcelroy is phenomenal .
do n't recommend the shorter chick , though .
dr. dust may be the most compassionate vet i 've ever met .
we now see drs .
i 've been taking my cat here for many years .
he sees dr. dust and i 've been incredibly happy with my visits here .
their prices are probably on the high end , but not unreasonable .
dr. dust and the rest of the staff are all wonderful .
parking is easy and the location is terrific .
: ) this is the best clinic i have used .
seems like you ca n't go wrong with any of the vets here .
thank you for not steering me wrong yelpers !
dr. rhodes was awesome .
we have found our forever vet !
i take my cat and my dog here .
the staff are really great with them .
bleeding gums , too skinny , torn pads , and whip worm .
the staff are really nice .
even the cats likes them .
i highly recommend them .
love this clinic and what they stand for !
thank you !
he 's now eating a wet food that he loves .
this cat mama is very appreciative of you , dr. mcelroy !
after my first experience , i agree .
for new clients , they provide a totally free check-up .
this does n't include vaccinations or anything .
i 'm grateful to yelp for steering me towards vca .
they are very warm and thoughtful .
i love coming to this clinic !
everyone is always very nice and helpful .
i take my cat to dr. mcelroy and she is great .
i will continue to bring my pet here for all his health care needs !
we 've been taking our new dogs there ever since .
i love vca !
they are always helpful and take extremely good care of my dog .
my dog likes all of the vet techs and especially loves dr dust !
do not go there !
three words don ; t go here !
i think i was his first client .
i am very disappointed in the pedicure i received today .
i am positive that i will never be back to this place .
they always do a great job on my eyebrows !
i never go anywhere else !
ask for phien , she is the best !
she is also very friendly !
i have no problem recommending this to my friends .
how i miss it .
i am a fan !
my one complaint is the parking situation .
sorry ... ) , and the highdive does not have its own lot .
there are no un-metered spots for miles .
this place is decent .
the layout is very strange .
it seems like an old restaurant with a stage in it .
is it like going to the metro in chicago ?
is it like going to the orpheum in madison ?
it 's a very tolerable and enjoyable venue .
i 've never been here for a show ... well , let me clarify .
things usually devolve into a shit show .
very intimate venue to see your fave bands play with good food and libations .
if you 're coming to a show , get there early to snag seating .
folks , this is your quintessential small town concert venue .
i like it .
the view and sound is fantastic .
worst bar i 've ever been too .
pay $ _ num _ dollars for cover and expect a complete waste of your money .
cash is preferred , but i do believe they take debit/credit .
there are a few tables as well as the bar to sit at .
there 's a great stage for viewing the acts .
there is a bartender here with impressive mixology skils !
this is a lovely venue .
it 's a great location in downtown champaign .
this is what i would call a sweet book shop .
well it is .
i always find something unique when i shop here .
a great place to explore , and a real hidden treasure of champaign-urbana .
this is one of my favorite places in cu .
there are so many treasures to find here .
sometimes you have to dig a bit but it 's well worth it .
it 's now under new ownership but have no fear !
they 've already done a great job .
not sure they 're there yet but they 're trying .
a total steal !
as a total bookworm , let me just say that i adore this place .
upstairs is a maze of tiny rooms , each devoted to their own subject .
the staff is great .
the inventory is mind-blowing , and it is locally-owned !
i 'm a former literature professor with broad tastes in reading .
jane addams satisfies them .
do n't expect bargain prices .
the prices are often good , but not exceptionally good .
the new owners are much more welcoming , and now i go regularly again .
they know their stock and are glad to help you look for something .
but , really , browsing is the best part of the experience .
there is a great feel here , with books piled everywhere .
there are three stories of books in all genres .
i have found great gifts here as well as stuff i want to read .
they have a giant selection .
i love this treasure .
jane adams has a wildly big selection of unique books .
the only problem i ever have if going in and deciding on just a couple my favorite book store in the area .
i love how spacious the location is , with it 's three floors .
you can get a lot of in-store credit for what you have .
definitely something i have taken advantage of over the years .
i love this little bookstore in champaign !
here 's the deets : everything .
i like big books and i can not lie .
loving it !
for a small town like chambana , this is pretty good .
oh , did i tell you they have a carousel too ?
this is one of the better malls in this area .
they have a variety of stores for men , women , and kids .
there are no empty stores and it does get busy at the mall .
they have a great steak and potato company which closed in springfield years ago .
i like all the speciality stores that are here .
the food court is okay .
the carousel is real cool looking .
i 'm afraid my _ num _ year old will get hurt !
food court is n't that great .
list of stores : http : / / www.marketplacemall.com/directory stay away from the children 's place !
landmark review : there are not too many amenities compared to the other malls .
free kids play area a pretty plain regular mall just like the other thousands .
nice mall great stores and food court but they need more seating for people .
my favorite is macy 's and white house black market .
do n't make eye contact is the best bet .
the food court is pretty cool too .
they have a carasoul and some of the places hand out free samples .
this mall has really gone downhill in the past few years .
it seems as though no stores can survive there .
if a hollister ca n't survive i 'm not sure what can .
the food court is really nothing special .
i 've had the most luck at bergner 's .
my parents also shop there the most .
there are kiosks in the aisle .
i do n't use frequent these much .
during the holidays , there is usually gift wrapping and an angel tree .
carousel rides have doubled in price .
bathrooms are always nasty .
do they purposely hire anti-social custodians ?
they do n't know their head from their ass .
it 's so rare to have that kind of experience any more .
we really appreciate it !
if you go to.the.contractor counter and try.and get.served.good luck .
_ num _ people behind counter but i couldnt get waited on .
they always s have what i 'm looking for .
i 'm still horrified !
please do not believe the shop assistants in this store !
well , we are in europe now after paying _ num _ $ for this bed .
- second disgraceful lie and best ... they offer us a _ num _ % off on a new pump but ... they are not able to ship anything outside usa !
today is saturday 9/27 and i have not heard from anyone .
i feel like i am not a very valued customer .
fyi ... forget to say ... .
i am a `` _ num _ '' !
i plan to go to ivey 's for any future car needs .
ivey 's quality of work is superb and i can recommend him wihtout hesitation .
however , do n't let its appearance fool you .
he definitely knows what he is doing and is very good at it .
totally recommend .
prices are very reasonable .
great service , the guys are awesome .
many restaurants and businesses within walking distance , making this a convenient location .
clean as a whistle .
i am very pleased with this hotel .
i definitely feel like i got my money 's worth .
here 's what i liked : - it 's a real bargain .
- they offer free breakfast , but be warned : it 's carb overload .
but still , it 's a nice touch .
and here 's what i did n't love : - the rooms still feel cheap even with the updates .
but hey , you get what you pay for .
- it 's really easy to hear every little thing outside the room .
get ready to hear everything in the hallway and outside at the pool .
it is next to many restaurants and a mall and easy access to uiuc .
i prefer non carpeted rooms .
the continental breakfast is nothing but carbs .
everything smells like stale hairspray and old smoke .
the rooms are quaint and clean .
a king bed is $ _ num _ more than two beds .
have you ever tried to sleep with your mate in a double bed ?
thank you for a nice stay .
hey , i 'm pretty easy to please when it comes to business travel .
that 's not a huge deal though .
then i read about a previous issue bedbugs , as we drove into town .
it looks like an airport meets target .
i do n't know how better to describe it .
walls are stucco-textured .
yes , please !
i would stay here again , rooms are very nice and up-to-date .
better than most chain pizza , it 's ok .
it also has a really friendly , laid-back atmosphere .
i love monicals .
always good to have some `` hometown taste '' when visiting .
i love monicals and you ca n't beat the family deal .
formidwextern pizza , monicals is hands down my favorite .
also watch out for their coupons in the mail .
i eat here occasionally because it is by my work .
i swear we did not do anything to make her mad .
i nearly always grab carry-out .
they really need to work out the parking situation .
this is my least favorite location in champaign .
i prefer to drive to the location in tolono .
the mozzarella sticks were okay .
monical 's has always been around , as long as i can remember .
pizza is average , thin crust in little squares that is pretty soggy .
the family pleaser is what we always get .
which just adds an iceburg lettuce salad and soft drinks to a pizza order .
to me , having eaten here during my graduate school days .
this monical person is only really good at making average pizza .
and it comes with _ num _ toppings for under $ _ num _ .
i can not believe monicals gets such low ratings .
they have the best thin crust i 've ever tasted .
and yes , do put the french dressing on the za !
my favorite pizza place when i come to visit my family up this way .
