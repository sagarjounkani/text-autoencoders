overpriced .
the pizza was pretty bland , despite a hefty helping of oregano .
perhaps because i was indoctrinated into loving this pizza as a small child .
we got the thin crust with steak and bacon and it was awesome !
i had to knock it down a star .
the food was n't good .
went here after a doctors appointment one day .
the pizza was good .
the small salad was n't their best .
the service sucked .
the waitress did n't give us refills and nothing was clean .
she gave us our check but never came back to take our money .
finally , the manager did .
a few years ago but sadly , it closed .
i could n't believe what i was hearing .
service was just ok and they actually got our pizza order wrong .
the pizza was missing a topping that we actually paid for .
ordered delivery which did n't take long at all .
our waitress was rude and did t want to fix the issue .
i would suggest picking up your order instead of delivery .
there was an additional location listed for champaign which turns out to be closer .
the pizza was barely warmer than room temperature .
luckily , uhaul came through and found a truck for me .
what happened to logical customer service ?
as of last spring , they had a parrot .
that was cool .
i had to have all the bedding replaced .
then when i took a shower , i saw that the towels were dirty .
unfortunately , i made the mistake of reserving _ num _ nights here .
everything else was great !
the upstairs area was great !
things i loved about eastland suites : the staff - incredibly attentive , super helpful breakfast - great for the pricepoint extended stay - very comfortable & great for business pool - the kids loved it !
i hired blossom basket for my wedding flowers .
she was patient and helpful as i struggled to figure out my flower design .
the second time i went in , i was paired with a different employee .
she was rude and short with me at times .
used them for my wedding .
everything came out well .
my colors matched perfectly ( even my dream lavender roses !
brittany was awesome to work with !
she also put together beautiful table settings filled with hydrangeas .
they called me back and arranged to have them delivered anyway !
flowers looked good ... .
for about _ num _ hours , then the wilting began .
made a last minute order and within hours it was delivered !
: ) the flowers were gorgeous !
the service was impeccable .
so we had a predicament , one that blossom basket took care of .
blossom basket replaced the arrangement with a new one right away .
both arrangements were creative and pretty .
i did feel the second one looked better .
i could n't believe that they assembled a beautiful bouquet-which lasted for _ num _ weeks !
- and had it delivered within one hour of my call !
they even sent me pictures by email of the flowers and balloons before delivery .
if i could go anywhere else i would .
carle medical supply was a great place for me to get my cpap machine .
thanksgiving _ num _ , my mother was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer .
mom knew she was in good hands .
i was such an avid bus-rider in champaign-urbana .
there was no need to own a car , really .
moving to los angeles was quite a shock to the system .
nyc could learn a thing or two too !
every ride with him was fun , guy always had something to say .
so one afternoon , stopped by to eat a chicken teriyaki sandwich .
looked pretty good .
they served me a half raw chicken sub !
i wanted to get myself some sweet tea but they had none .
cheap and did n't mess them up , so i was happy .
this might have been the worst hair cut i have ever had .
she easily cut _ num _ ( !
it was around 12:30 pm on a friday and the sign said open .
there were to my knowledge _ num _ employees in the salon doing nothing .
i was wrong .
very disappointed and hurt that my business was not accepted here .
the haircut , minus the bangs , was perfect .
friendly service and decently priced for men and women .
i would highly recommend this place to anyone who needs a nice haircut !
i would highly recommend this place to anyone who needs a nice haircut !
overpriced and never again especially for female haircuts .
i went there today and asked to curl my hair with a straightener .
she told me no .
later she told me she did perms to my hair so dont go here no one speaks proper english and messes up with your hair they were professional and courteous .
they took their time and listened to what i wanted .
overall , i would go again but not in love with the place .
my friends and i would go to rocks just to get horseshoes .
the ob-gyn who was there was fantastic .
this saved me a ton of cash .
it was an outrage .
i recently went to planned parenthood for my birth control needs .
my health care practitioner was professional , courteous , and very friendly .
she made what could have been an uncomfortable experience rather pleasant !
they went above and beyond for quality care and service .
i felt like i was in an interrogation room right from the start .
at the time , i really felt intruded upon .
i did n't want to get pregnant , and that should have been enough .
one that did n't want this job and was perhaps having a bad day .
the nurse practitioner went very slow and explained everything as she did it .
and she made conversation !
request of renewal denied by doctor '' .
how did they put it ?
i loved the big ten games and the energy of the campus .
i would never have picked a different place to spend four years !
the first test average was a _ num _ % and there was no curve .
i did that a lot and it was worth it for the english-speaking tas .
come here for memorable experiences and lifelong friends .
you held out so long for more alumni dollars .
the chief was a total badass , enough said .
i earned a ba and an ms from uiuc .
got it ?
i transferred into uiuc at _ num _ as a junior .
they all felt i was especially when they found out how old i was .
i also transferred into uiuc at _ num _ .
( at least for engineers ) my profs were great , greek system was great ( yeah sk and triangle !
i previously went to marquette university for my freshman and sophomore years .
that said , the school 's trying .
perhaps more importantly , it did prepare me for the world that came after .
if i could go back in time to relive it all , i would !
i was in awe at how beautiful the old buildings were .
yes , you heard that right .
i had a great time here , majored in spanish and minored in french .
i supported myself and my family all because of my degree from here .
then i did and then my younger sister did .
i would think there would be a better representation of many racial groups there .
also , i saw a billboard for an african american homecoming dance .
you see , i was a student there from _ num _ to _ num _ .
the university was less selective in admissions at that time .
indeed i had a roommate who flunked out in his senior year .
freshmen got drunk at kam 's and puked all over the sidewalk .
had my master here in communication .
i attended 2008-2012 and i received an undergraduate degree in biology .
unfortunately they did not maintain high standards .
some of the bricks looked unsteady on the bumpy ground .
the bell tower in the mathematics building was unfortunately closed .
we missed the narrow window of 12:30-1 pm , for a tour .
parking was challenging even just to find a metered spot .
we had an info session and tour for my brother yesterday .
our tour guide was not .
most questions were answered with `` i do n't know '' .
the dorm we saw was so small .
the campus itself was gorgeous , very spread out and green .
the kam was sort of the chicago mca equivalent for me .
a few friends and i had so much fun wandering the place .
went for a friend ; she was opening her mfa exhibition .
one half star knocked off ` cuz was extra-tempted by her claims of wine .
sadly , they only served soda .
i used april 's florist for my wedding , seven years ago .
she did a wonderful job .
worked with me on price , design , etc .
everything was wonderful and she was fun to talk and plan with .
they were so pretty .
i had never heard of april 's florist before finding them online .
my first thought was that they were a bit pricey .
she said they were the best floral arrangement she had ever gotten .
she sent me a picture and i expected less than what you see online .
but they looked exactly like the online advertisement .
was in and out in under _ num _ minutes .
i got my flowers and boy were they beautiful and super fresh !
it tasted okay , but not great .
after my first order from this place i would n't dare order again .
i got the double sauteed pork with `` fried rice . ''
my friend had a tofu dish that was ok .
tasted like bbq sauce mixed with teriyake .
but i was n't in the mood for meat .
so ... i got the veggie lo mein .
it felt like oil slicks in my mouth .
really fast and really reasonably priced .
stopped by empire yesterday for some quick takeout .
cons : decor was sort of confusing and borderline gross .
we wondered what had been living in the empty fishtank near the door .
my friends got sweet and sour chicken .
they said it was alright .
the fried rice was bright yellow - almost saffron-y in color .
the egg roll was disappointing .
i had the pork with ` string beans , ' a.k.a .
also , i would highly recommend the dry chili chicken off the chinse menu .
one time , though , we ordered the lemon chicken .
the staff was friendly and helpful and the food came out pretty quickly .
i would come back .
tried the shrimp fried rice .
had some solid pepper steak .
when my wife was in vet school we ate here every week .
the general tsos tofu was amazing as was the mai fun and mu shu .
had their fried fish thing with some vegetable .
highly recommended !
frequented this establishment many times during college and was always satisfied .
` nuff said .
recently i found a cockroach in the bathroom !
ewww : ( it used to be good .
but today the barista made me so mad !
what was this nice service that everyone speaks off ?
first of all , they never put a sleeve on the cup .
come on !
baristas were a little cranky , but not overly so .
i ordered a soy latte with hazelnut syrup and it was delicious .
inside was quiet and spacious .
they combined the two in my cup .
i asked for less milk , hoping to be able notice some coffee flavor .
tried some coffee here and it was alright .
it tasted as if it were loaded with white pepper .
starbucks became starbucks for a reason .
i could not have been happier leasing from roland realty .
i lived at 702/704 w elm st in urbana for a year .
they were fair with returning the security deposit .
it was relatively cheap , however .
despite my issues with the building , i almost stayed for a second year .
i would definitely recommend living with roland .
_ num _ ) i lost my keys to my apartment .
they said no because it 's not fair for my roommates safety .
they refused , and charged me $ _ num _ dollars !
for some reason they charged me for the key fob after i moved out .
i would rent from them again in a heartbeat .
i recently went back and the place had gone waaay downhill .
dazzling nails saved the day .
every nail salon i could reach was closed except this place .
both of the women who did our mani-pedis were quick but very thorough .
the service was very conscientious and friendly , and the cost very reasonable .
my friend also got her eyebrows waxed at the last minute : - manicure $ _ num _ - pedicure $ _ num _ - eyebrows $ _ num _ i highly recommend this cheap yet thorough salon .
everyone was very nice and accommodating .
the first time i went i got a shellac no-chip manicure .
i would highly recommend this salon to anyone .
i was so glad i chose this salon .
they cleaned up my cuticles and dead skin so everything looks nice and smooth .
the massage chair was awesome !
everyone was nice .
but for _ num _ bucks , i definitely got my money 's worth .
today was my first visit here so i went with an open mind .
it was pretty much what i expected and nothing much exceptional .
they shouted back and forth and laughed very loudly .
it was very annoying .
i did not feel comfortable in this place .
it was n't the cleanest either .
after waiting _ num _ minutes patiently ... one lady started working on her while i proceeded to wait another _ num _ minutes .
- manicurists borrowed tools from each other .
absolutely pitiful i went to get my nails and toes done and left so unhappy .
i got a manicure .
the entire salon and nail stations were disgusting .
there was a layer of acrylic dust on everything .
the place was terrible .
the selection was very limited and picked over and in very bad disarray .
however , i was able to find a few suits to try on .
in broken english she said go ahead .
i had to wait for a dressing room .
when i finally got a room i started to get undressed .
i had no idea men were allowed in woman 's dressing rooms these days !
then i saw a face peeking out from underneath the partition .
she did but her parents did nothing and said nothing .
after i bought the suit i went to macy 's .
hey rachel , was she homely ?
i only went in to grab a shirt very quickly .
i felt completely rushed and a bit chastised , which i hate .
i made the selection without delay .
we were not the only ones left shopping by an means .
this woman 's behavior was flat out rude and off-putting and completely inexcusable .
it was not worth fighting campus traffic to get there .
i went for lip and eye brow waxing .
did a great job on my brows specially .
i would go again .
we spent _ num _ minutes here waiting to make a 4-minute transaction .
we rented a truck online and had our confirmation email and receipt with us .
i called to make a reservation for a truck .
i was told that i had a 4-hour reservation for a $ _ num _ truck .
recently moved from champaign to wyoming .
i ordered a _ num _ ' truck with no extras for my move .
quick summary -- - had a reservation for a truck at 12:45 pm on 8/10 .
came to the store at 12:30 , got my truck at 2:15 .
every other aspect of this experience was hell .
* canned laughter * i 've used u-haul to move before on two occasions .
the interior looked so depressing .
the face of the gm was equally lifeless and depressing .
that aside , the service was beyond slow .
i knew from the past two experiences that i should get in early .
it did n't take _ num _ minutes to get my truck .
it took _ num _ hour and _ num _ minutes to get my truck .
the gm was serving people at the speed of snail .
# suckstosuck # 3spooky5me the gm never greeted me .
never looked at me .
never thanked me .
did n't even apologize for the excruciatingly long wait .
i finished my paperwork and was told to wait outside for him .
i finally walked out of that hell hole and got some fresh air .
i could n't believe it .
as if he could n't have told me that from the beginning ?
i rented a truck in july for a one-way move .
so i decided to make a second personal appearance .
the process took about an hour .
also , the boxes that i bought there fell apart .
my truck was already fitted with a hitch but no wiring .
i really did n't know the first thing about what i needed to buy .
on the day of pick up - the computer system was `` down '' .
no other locations nearby were open or had available trailers in any size .
mr. hubbard was rude , inconsiderate , and unhelpful .
he made no effort to reach a resolution .
he made degrading and insulting remarks in my ability to understand the situation .
many other customers were affected on this same day .
the employees at the establishment were eager and willing to help .
-- -- i contacted uhaul customer service with no response or resolution terribly slow .
i went here on the recommendation of my colleague at work .
otherwise it was a very pleasant experience and i enjoyed it !
could n't really ask for more .
i ended up getting a free sandwich .
i finally decided to give this place a try .
the place seemed clean and the workers were friendly .
i had the california gulch on wheat and my friend had the steam engine .
the sandwich overall had a clean taste .
also when we have had it delivered it has take an hour plus .
did n't even get to try it .
i had ordered online and had prepaid a pretty generous tip .
i got home and began to tear into the sub .
i was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was .
however , i would n't call it the best sub i 've ever eaten .
i came here for some quick and fast subs .
my time was absolutely wasted .
tasted pretty fresh and put together really well .
i saved over $ _ num _ with the hooked deal and the subs were good .
got ta try it , if you have n't already .
i was blown away .
though twice my underaged friend went and got the overage wristband .
been awhile since i 've been here .
guard your jacket unless you want a free drink spilled on it .
overpriced and dirty .
never had any good memories from this place .
guaranteed .
_ num _ ) the people at brothers tend to be so completely and utterly hammered .
just been there once .
crazy cheap for an alum used to chicago bar prices .
tried the broski for four .
done and done .
did we really need that jamba juice ?
they served some of the best comfort food available .
this was _ num _ years ago !
overall , u of i was a very nice campus .
did i mention it was busy ?
only been to the first floor and food court .
i spent countless hours here studying away .
tenant union - if you have issues with your land lord _ num _ .
come study in the president 's lounge .
the basement 's got a variety of quick bites at your service .
oh , did i mention that this place is also a hotel ?
working here was n't the greatest experience + most stories are n't locally relevant .
the tow guy was also super helpful and courteous .
i would avoid this company at all costs !
i had to overpay him .
it looked as if someone had used a crowbar to unlock the car .
of course , this was another $ _ num _ fix at the subaru dealer .
had a great experience , all things considered .
timely , organized , and polite .
that said , thanks reynolds .
my son 's scooter was towed from the front of papa john 's pizza .
cheapest place i called , and the man on the phone was very polite .
it was playing a chinese game show .
i was disappointed with crispy tofu that is not as good as before .
we ordered the seafood pho .
my boyfriend was a little annoyed since he had gotten something completely different .
we then asked for srirarcha ( sp ? )
and got a tiny dollop of it .
it was very salty and unpleasant .
i felt disgusted that i actually ate half since i was so hungry .
multiple theories as to why we were treated this way .
the food i would consider a cross between chinese and taiwanese style comfort food .
there was n't a lot of options , only about _ num _ items .
both of which were disappointing !
the shrimp crepe only had two small pieces of shrimp .
the turnip cake was just off , seemed like it was n't cooked right .
the shui mai and shrimp dumpling were small , but it tasted fine .
not entirely saddened by this experience because at least it was n't expensive .
when they were under previous management , their food was great .
i would pay _ num _ dollars for the intestine dish .
i was pleasantly surprised with this place .
service was n't the best , but it was n't horrifyingly bad either .
the peking pork was fried to perfection and the sauce was very tasty .
in general they were okay .
$ _ num _ something for decent lunch portions with steamed or fried rice .
the tofu , soups , and more traditional dishes looked good .
minuses : the fried american-style dishes were food-court quality .
my companion found a bug in her food .
_ num _ ) shrimp crepes - pretty good ... i would have liked more shrimp though _ num _ ) congee - this came with a pork sausage which was tasty .
the pho was excellent .
soup base was flavorful , noodles chewy , meat offering varied and delicious .
i took my dad there today to give him some dim-sum experience .
went here looking for pho because i was having a huge craving for it .
both were great .
crispy tofu and eggplant were the highlights of the night .
ended up being $ _ num _ pp !
this place had generally good reviews , but i had an entirely different experience .
it was a very disappointing .
i had heard from friends that it was great .
we walked in about 12:15 and did not leave until about 2:30 .
we walked in and it was very hectic .
so we sat there and waited , and waited and waited .
_ num _ minutes had gone by and nothing .
we were very upset because we only had a short lunch break .
about _ num _ minutes later , our first dish came out .
slowly , our little dim sum dishes came out .
our last dish came about _ num _ minutes later from our first dish .
went here many times with friends while i was down at uofi .
that i figured i 'd eat here just to get the taste .
i ordered har gow , shui mai , shrimp spring rolls and beef balls .
total came to about $ _ num _ .
everything was yummy and fairly fast !
i grew up in taiwan so i know what i 'm talking about .
not that good but had no other choice .
i used to eat here frequently .
however , my last two visits were terrible .
they simply served it .
the first time i was not sure .
but apparently they would just keep the overcharge if i had acquiesced .
amazed by the variety of choices .
how could a restaurant try to cook all styles of chinese food .
food was okay , not great but not bad .
the waitress did not even notify me .
i ordered the hot pot and it was n't even a hot pot .
there was no soup ( wtf ) !
i would give zero star if i could .
i said sweet .
the owner explained that the sweet soy sauce was an extra $ _ num _ .
had i not asked she would never had told me .
second time , my friend wanted to come here .
the owner asked whether i want pork belly or port tenderloin for a dish .
i said belly , and a magical one dollar was added to my bill .
then i specially asked whether the rick comes with dishes or not .
she said yes and secretly added another $ _ num _ to my bill .
when i confronted her , she said the rice was $ _ num _ per person .
at this point , i was beyond pissed by this dishonest act .
um , it was okay .
came here for dim sum and incomparable to chicago dim sum .
i came with a large party and we ordered quite a bit of food .
all of the classic dim sum dishes were done fairly well .
everything else we ordered was pretty standard fare .
the doctor i had was completely negligent in correcting a problem she had created .
i saw dr. samuel-parks at the mahomet location to discuss weight loss medication .
dr. samuel-parks was condescending and dismissive .
she just assumed i drink _ num _ calorie frappes . )
she did n't even perform a full physical on me .
my previous review was for carle hospital .
not sure how it showed up here .
something i said ?
which was also supposed to be paid _ num _ % with no co-pay .
additionally , i had some lab work that came back abnormal .
they did further testing without my consent .
today was the last straw .
my experience actually started quite positive .
which they did not do !
i did n't even have the chance to describe all of my symptoms !
at least the doctor seemed friendly .
had a great time here during the day after a bar scramble .
some drunk guy peed on my foot here .
i was only eighteen and not proud to be in the bar .
hell , maybe i stole someone else 's beer .
well , i went back to campus this weekend for the michigan-illinois game .
if you like puke , and freshmen , and freshmen puking , come here .
recently voted as the best place in champaign-urbana to have a one night stand .
the drinks were worse and painfully weak .
i was horrified to see people in formal wear .
guess they were pre-gaming it there ?
however kams did it to me .
these people we met at the football game randomly invited us .
even though my friends warned me , we went anyway .
( it was n't terrible . )
the guys were also buying shots , which helped a lot .
my feet stuck to the floor throughout the entire bar .
the tables probably had n't been cleaned in years .
the staff at this place was something else .
that was the only reason it did n't get one star .
came here _ num _ years after my graduation ... and not much has changed .
it still smelled like vomit , stale beer , and service sucked .
its littered with garbage vomit and broken glass .
i ate a hotdog that they grill outside because they smelled great .
regretted that in _ num _ hours .
i went there for the memories .
this was humiliating at best .
tis was definitely my favorite bookstore !
it always had all my books , with used and new options .
reserving books online was definitely a time saver .
i used to love t.i.s .
outdated ?
two days ago i purchased an iclicker here for $ _ num _ including tax .
this afternoon i attempted to return the unopened product with the original receipt .
the staff was helpful .
only offering manzana lift would make things better .
i also bought some candy and a strawberry boing !
drink and the total was only $ _ num _ .
very reasonably priced and worth every bite !
breakfast this great tasting would cost a lot more anywhere else .
he recommended all these fantastic mexican places for me in chicago .
the guac was the best i 've ever had .
i tried carnitas , shredded beef , and chorizo tacos .
all of them were quite delicious !
but the food was n't the only impressive part about this establishment .
tried this place the first week in c-u .
after having read the reviews , i was expecting more .
the woman at the counter was friendly , but the food was disappointing .
there were flies all over the place .
the produce looked so sad and wilted .
been here a few times now and everything tried was spectacular .
tacos w cilantro , onion , and wedge of lime .
i went here a few months ago and had the tacos al pastor .
there were no highchairs , just the one nasty , sticky booster seat .
it was `` _ num _ five alarm hot sauce '' level .
i could barely eat it .
i 'd walked past this place many , many times before actually going in .
ate here for the second & last time a few days ago .
my wife & i both had ` mexi-belly ' the next day .
i noticed that my container felt oily .
shame ` cus i liked the place .
restaurant review : i had to even ask if they accepted credit cards , yes they do !
everything in the restaurant was sticky from the menu to table to the floor .
unfortunately this was not the case .
i was hungry so i enjoyed my chips still and ate the whole basket .
when my carne asada came it was not what i expected .
why would you put giant pieces of green onion in with the carne asada .
these were not pleasant and bitter tasting .
this was again not the case .
very thinly sliced meat that was very chewy .
the refried beans was a soupy mess , but the mexican rice was passable .
did i mention that there was so much oil in the dish ... seriously ... pro : none ... .
hidden gem : _ num _ dollar tacos on wednesday tacky decorations , tacky store at the front , awkward register blocking the door .
the portion was adequate ( i think they could have used a smaller plate .
the large plate with the portion given made it look very small ! )
the tacos i got were carnitas and steak .
it was delicious and flavorful !
the steak was likewise very delicious .
the salsa was so spicy !
i loved it , hah .
i would return here for their $ _ num _ tacos .
she was nice but was n't too helpful with questions .
service was a bit slow and waters did not get refilled .
the ground beef tasted a bit off last time i was here .
chicken was dry and adding salsa did not help .
ambiance/music - an ant was crawling on me while eating .
felt like we were in mexico .
scrambled eggs with chorizo was the bomb !
waitress also did not know anything about menu items .
this made it a little difficult to eat because the insides kept falling out .
the steak was like finely chopped up and at times resembled ground beef .
it was also quite greasy .
got _ num _ chicken tacos ... .
the chips and salsa that was brought out was also phenomenal !
i had a margarita and a mexican shrimp cocktail .
it seemed almost fermented like it was expired .
the chicken tacos were pretty mediocre in taste in my opinion .
had carnitas tacos .
when i was _ num _ , i thought this place was the greatest thing ever .
i was pretty stupid when i was _ num _ .
when i went in it smelled overpoweringly like barf .
it was so strong i could n't talk , listen or even think .
what did she say ?
needless to say it was also too crowded , dark and dirty .
such was the magic of cos .
the hot and spicy squid was really good .
they said they were delivered so they could not give me my money back .
i got * great * customer service here .
i wasted a trip .
i could get better flowers at the grocery store .
the arrangement was all wonky and out of proportion as well .
i ordered on-line an arrangement for my cousin , who is hospitalized with cancer .
phyllis returned my call first thing in the morning .
i was relieved to hear that the beautiful roses would all be present !
my cousin sent me a photo of the floral arrangement and it was beautiful .
she was delighted .
staff was friendly and they had what we needed .
the birthday cake eminems were on sale but they were disappointing at best grab decent sandwiches and gyros , and enjoy live music if it 's scheduled .
often crowded , so plan on a wait for food and a table .
the gyros were pretty good , but their fries came with this amazing sauce .
one familiar restaurant was zorba 's .
got two med .
when we sat outside on the quad , we upwrapped a tightly rolled gyro .
so eating it outside on a windy day was not a problem at all !
i went almost every tuesday as it was cheaper on tuesday .
the chicken gyro never had that effect for whatever reason .
i learned this the hard way .
when i ate meat the gyros were very good too !
and it was another hit !
chicken gyros and fried mushrooms for dinner hit the spot .
i frequented this place all the time when i was a student at uofi .
good ole z-bots as we liked to call this one back in the day .
hasnt changed much cept that now i can drink the beer .
zorba 's burned to the ground march _ num _ , _ num _ .
this was my favorite place to get gyros in town .
so greasy it burned the fuck down !
currently closed due a fire above them .
my parents used to come here when they were dating back in the day .
they started taking me and my brother as kids .
was just there for lunch today , was great to be back !
i ordered my food and waited to pay .
the cashier left to take orders , and the line started backing up .
the only thing i paid for was the convenience of eating on green st .
all i got was something overpriced and meh .
well , it was pretty much the same as i remembered .
well , the sauce here was runny , warm , and almost clear .
green street did n't feel the same without you since you burned down .
although the ambiance is much improved , my gyro lacked taste .
yep , it lived up to the hype .
i also liked that there are multiple size options for the sandwiches .
the greek salad was n't anything special either .
i got ta say that i prefer niro 's gyros more .
the joint that launched my love affair with the gyro .
did n't know a gyro could achieve the melt in your mouth consistency .
my name was taken and i was called when it was ready .
i dashed home and unwrapped everything , anxious to try it .
i did think that this gyro was really on point though .
the tzatziki was really good , too !
kind of creamy but not too yogurt-y or watered down like some places .
the mac and cheese bites were also surprisingly good .
the only thing i did not like was the portion/price .
today tuesday was dollar off classic gyro or 1/2 price fries .
i grew up in champaign and this was a favorite stomping ground !
we got _ num _ of the beef/lamb gyros and a greek salad .
i thought the gyro was okay .
the fries that came with the combination platter were not good at all .
those were mostly left untouched .
being able to peruse a bit would have been nice .
pricing was reasonable .
the bread was great , the hummus was just average .
i really liked my gyro though !
sometimes they got deals on hook .
did they ask my permission to use it ?
did they credit me with the image ?
and yet they did n't .
i felt too nostalgic here to give this place one star .
i used to come here in the mid _ num _ 's as an undergrad .
the fries were just okay .
loved the greek salad and gyro plate .
the interior was nice and roomie and had and interesting set of furniture .
the sauce was very tomato-y .
reasonably priced illini gear with a friendly staff .
the items seemed to be decent quality too .
it was a really weird experience .
te ` shurt was the answer to our prayers !
the quality of the custom printed shirts are superior to other printers on campus .
otherwise , it would be a two star selection .
a little surprising considering how great i thought the food was .
the food is mainly tapas ( for dinner at least ... great dish , i would definitely have it again !
you ca n't really go wrong and indeed it was delicious .
and brought me the most gigantic glass of port i 'd ever seen .
cafe luna would totally pass muster back home in california .
or was it ?
: ) i was a big fan of caf luna when it was on campus .
i ate lunch their frequently when i still worked on campus .
everything was great value for the price , beautifully presented , fresh and creative .
none of the staff seemed at all enthusiastic about serving us .
our assigned server for the evening was helpful and satisfactory but not warm .
the food was all right but way overpriced .
come on guys .
the coconut shrimp and accompanying sauce were excellent .
the duck confit ravioli were also very good .
he did order more bread just to soak up the leftover sauce .
the food this time also fell short ... we ordered the shrimp special , which was grilled and came with coconut risotto .
the shrimp was disgustingly over-salted , and the risotto was a pilaf .
the final disaster was the fried gnocchi .
i hated it .
my mom thought the artichoke had been frozen .
the sauce , however , was very good without being too fondue-like .
i ended up dipping bread in it .
we also got the beef tenderloin , which was decent .
i thought it was similar to wasabi .
it came with potatoes and onions that were perfectly cooked but plain .
the cilantro-lemongrass pork rib was my favorite next to the goat cheese .
the creamy clams were gross .
the duck confit was a disappointment .
my mom and friend really liked it , though .
oh , i thought the prices were really good .
we got all of that for fifty-five bucks .
we started out with salads that were a bit pricey but absolutely delicious .
the asparagus was flavorful , tender and perfectly cooked .
it had then been soaked in a very bland brine and was extremely waterlogged .
so it was bizarrely dry and soggy a the same time .
what little of it could be eaten was pretty horrible .
the sauce that come with it , however , was really good .
my initial visual assessment was highly optimistic .
the waitress apologized that they were `` short on menus . ''
but , ok , they were short on menus .
( they also gave us mismatching water glasses .
hers was only marginally better !
a tomato puree that had cinammon in it , for some reason .
one of our _ num _ orders came out wrong .
the waitress did n't charge us for the soup .
so , that was nice of her .
not sure who the last reviewers are but here is mine ... i came to urbana from chicago with my _ num _ year old son .
first the atmosphere was charming .
we first sat on the patio and felt like we were really in spain .
as far as the food was concerned , we were very happy !
the french inspiried tapas were awesome .
the seafood was cooked to perfection ; the proportions were perfect .
the wait staff were amazing .
cafe luna changed my mind that night .
the cheese was gooey and the bread perfect .
duck confit ravioli - these were so rich .
they were still ok .
they were not mushy , but not crisp .
the sauce they were served with really came to the rescue .
i could have just eaten a bowl of that sauce .
the prosciutto crostini was good .
we also had salads .
i instead had the house herb dressing salad .
ooo it looked so good and he did n't even give me a bite !
this time that we went with our friends , the staff was amazing .
that was it !
we ordered some coconut shrimp , and some ravioli with goat cheese and asparagus .
he explained the pricing , the taste , and the overall service .
luna used to be my favorite restaurant when it was on campus .
and the cooks could n't even cook it through the second time ?
the person who ordered it touched the meat and said it was quite cool .
they did n't apologize or act like they cared at all .
at the old location , this was my favorite restaurant in town .
their duck tapas was really tasty too .
i cheapened the set , haha .
we were seated promptly .
and what the specials were .
while she looked on blankly , we suggested a decanter .
she brought one back and whisked away the first glass .
the wine , once the sediment was gone was good .
there were bread plates on the table but we had to ask for bread .
the food was different and tasty .
anyway , walked it , loved the decor !
then we waited awkwardly for about _ num _ more minutes .
we decided we were just going to eat and drink at the bar .
we ordered a salad , melting brie pot and lobster & crab stuffed prawns .
well , the salad was pretty good .
the potato totally overpowered the brie and you could barely taste it .
then the `` prawns '' came out ... .
we said fine .
they came out ( four of them ) , not stuffed at all .
had not expected it to be so close to it .
the place was very nice .
and the artichokes were cooked wonderfully .
i justpoked it with my fork and it fell apart .
she had a side of fresh greens with a zippy sauce that was yum .
i loved this .
really did .
we saw them open this morning and jumped in for brunch .
the food was ok , a bit overpriced but not awful .
everything was spot on delicious !
the french horn was good but a little sour for my tastes .
i thought it was very reasonably priced for everything we had .
i definitely would recommend it anytime you 're in town !
the squash was great , but the prosciutto was really crunchy and tasteless .
the cinnamon rolls were only ok .
a chicago reviewer would say `` there are kinks . ''
she brought the table of _ num _ four slices of bread .
the dishes were extremely underwhelming , and the first _ num _ or _ num _ were cold .
they were bites .
service was great-especially since it was spring break and it was not crowded .
the tapas were great portions .
tried the walnut goat cheese balls with honey ... divine !
the mussels in spicy curry were tasteful , not really spicy at all though .
i really used to like how haphazard luna was when it was on campus .
food was overpriced and low quality .
orders were messed up .
had to ask for silverware .
dear caf luna , you had ruined my graduation dinner on may 14th , _ num _ .
i had made a reservation at 8p .
one customer told us to find the host wearing white with an apron .
then finally after another _ num _ minutes , we were being seated .
however , this nightmare did not end then .
and , we were finally allowed to order after _ num _ minutes of sitting !
neither the server , nor the host , was attentive and helpful .
the server had this terrible attitude toward us the whole time .
nothing much was explained nor bettered throughout our experience .
and the foods were not the best they could be consider the price .
we could not grasp the understanding of this horrific experience .
was it that we looked foreigner and stupid ?
was it because we were furious having to wait even with a reservation ?
caf luna , you had successfully ruined my graduation celebration .
i would never ever go there again .
it was truly a nightmare , by : one of your customer who intends to let everyone know about this incident pros : the beignets were tasty and so was the sandwich .
cons : - i was seated without a menu .
- i ordered the beignets and they forgot to put chocolate sauce on the plate .
my omelet came to me with the eggs slightly loose : perfect .
the filling was sauted mushrooms and a couple of cheeses .
the cheeses were high quality and the mushrooms were freshly sauted .
my companion ordered a quiche , which she enjoyed and which i sampled .
were used , and that the custard was mostly cream .
i would guess that service degrades considerably during busy periods .
on weekends , this area of town would be relatively quiet .
summary : in my one visit to cafe luna , the restaurant was truly outstanding .
we ordered the first seven appetizers on the menu and they were all perfect .
all _ num _ appetizers perfectly done .
we were not in a michelin star restaurant in new york or la .
this was champaign , illinois - a university town .
again , i only tried the tapas .
i changed my order to the chicken dijonaise .
it came out looking decent until i took a bite .
there was so much salt on it , i could n't eat it .
ok , so i used to love luna when it was on campus .
first and second , i went with a group for brunch .
my second trip , our group had reservations and we still waited _ num _ minutes !
third ( and i 'm afraid final ) visit was a disaster .
this was another large-ish group ( about _ num _ ) with reservations .
drink orders were taken but never filled .
all of this happened while thirsty patrons are still waiting for their first drinks .
i ordered risotto that night .
the very delicious-looking fries were sort of like my risotto , cold and wrong .
of course that was all wrong and took another half hour .
we ended up waiting an hour to be seated .
there was no sitting area , just a hallway so it was rather uncomfortable .
when we were finally seated , we had a delicious meal .
+ second time i went there was for a date with my boyfriend .
we left full and a little tipsy ( good wine ! )
there was hardly anyone at the restaurant but we still had terrible service .
they seemed understaffed , apparently due to rehearsal dinner going on simultaneously .
my friend had a very rare steak that took forever to be sent back .
in my experience , it was the exact opposite .
the service was perfect .
the charcuterie platter was edible , but lackluster .
the day we went they had a set menu for $ _ num _ a person .
without exaggeration , the food was disgusting .
the restaurant looked nice , good atmosphere .
the service was fine .
first course : lox with cream spread and bread and oysters the salmon tasted like it was two weeks old .
the oysters were the same .
i would n't be surprised if it came from some frozen bag at costco .
mixed greens with beets was pretty good .
the meat was tough and stringy .
it was way over-seasoned .
and it was like _ num _ % tough , inedible fat .
i could make a better steak when i was _ num _ .
the lamb chops were so tough , we could n't even eat them .
dessert was the best part of the meal .
and it was still awful .
the pastry was fine .
it was impossible to chew .
this was just unacceptable .
i could n't find it from the actual review page !
i had made a reservation at 8p .
one customer told us to find the host wearing white with an apron .
then finally after another _ num _ minutes , we were being seated .
however , this nightmare did not end then .
and , we were finally allowed to order after _ num _ minutes of sitting !

caf luna , you had successfully ruined my graduation celebration .
i would never ever go there again .
it was truly a nightmare , by : one of your customer who intends to let everyone know about this incident unable to get in to the restaurant we wanted , discovered luna by chance .
every item we ordered was a symphony to our palettes .
yeah , my friend j and i were ready to bolt !
but ... the service was a bit slow , but it was pretty busy .
the pear beignets were yummy and the coffee was good .
we ordered the croque monsieur and swiss roesti .
they took down my review twice ... .
it was not offensive at all except stating the facts .
we first went to basmati and honestly i thought we were doomed .
there was no flavor and most dishes seemed to be watered down .
it turned out to be okay although it was n't excellent .
waitresses were cute .
the biryani was also very good .
the manager knew me by my first name , hahahahha that was embarassing .
seriously , a bit awkward to have my table wiped down in mid-sentence .
threw out a $ _ num _ plate of food after finding hair .
the decor was exactly the same .
the waiters seemed to be the same too .
i tried my boyfriend 's lamb saag dish and loved it also .
very good and reasonably priced .
great indian food ; spiced well and not americanized .
this restaurant was good , fine , but i was n't particularly impressed .
ordered vegetable vindaloo .
all day and all night my stomach was a bubbling cauldron of curry .
my spouse and i ate lunch there with some friends on 5/30/11 .
the food was okay and plentiful , but the wait service was horrible .
the waiter was extremely unfriendly , discourteous , and unhelpful .
it was a very unwelcoming place .
my favorite was always chicken makhani .
i moved away from chambana to the south west .
i could hardly read my menu there at night .
the food was delicious and pretty authentic .
i walked out with a severe case of food poisoning .
it took my stomach two days to recover from this fiasco .
service was fast .
the naan was nice but just slightly burnt .
we tried weekday buffet last week .
for $ _ num _ + tip + tax , it had enough varieties .
lunch buffet had probably the best naan i 've tried in many years .
the food was awesome , prepared hot .
restaurant review the lunch special seemed enticing for 7 + dollars depending on what you order .
the curry was not spicy at all which was perfect .
it was rich and creamy with ample amount of chicken .
the naan was simply the largest naan i have ever seen .
it was perfect with the curry .
no salad though as mentioned previously .
pro : large menu with lunch specials , large naan , not too spicy curry cons : plasticware , slow service hidden gem : 7 + dollar lunch specials with large naan or rice and potato pakora food was pretty average .
waitress was pleasant .
i ordered the mixed grill .
it was all chicken .
where was the mix that was on the menu ?
you and a buddy could get away splitting a dish for $ _ num _ .
i ordered my food online with my credit card at about 6:30 pm .
i was told that the delivery guy should be picking up soon .
around 9 pm , i called again .
this time i was told i had to call delivery.com .
he said , `` it says you are paying with cash . ''
i just stood there .
then my hunger snapped me back to my senses .
he walked out unaffected .
the lack of silverware and napkins was a nice touch .
i ordered an aloo paratha once and the owner brought me a regular paratha .
did you think i did n't know ?
but _ num _ out of _ num _ times i would go to ambar .
i ordered chicken curry , the meat was spoiled and made me throw out .
the food was good !
the naan was gigantic , warm , and quite tasty .
he gave us a naan on the house too ordered the a spicy chickpea/potato dish with a side of rice and a soda .
rice was stale , cold , and hard .
meal came out to nearly $ _ num _ .
and he had a religious tattoo to show that he meant it .
i got a $ _ num _ chicken korma with no chicken .
i substituted paneer .
turns out , i was almost right .
the receipt indeed showed a higher price .
i was purposely trying to stay under $ _ num _ .
very disappointed by this experience .
i had the dinner at this place few months back and it was disappointing .
i had veg assorted appetizer , chicken tikka masala and naan .
veg appetizer was ok , rest was not good .
they were so oily and soggy .
i was hoping samosa will save the day but hell no : ( .
the filling was bland , the pastry was neither crispy nor flaky .
the only thing tasting good was tea , which was made by me .
sorry , i could go on and on here - better stop now !
all seemed satisfied with the selections chosen for me .
the salesperson was very helpful , explaining the subtle nuances of the various cigars .
we talked of smokes , single malt scotch , and their regular smokers .
others in the store joined in .
am amazed at the selection of pipes , tobacco , cigars , etc .
i dropped a good amount of dough here considering it was my first visit .
great atmosphere and the owner was very friendly and welcoming .
i swore by this place in college !
i , on the other hand , got the italian beef .
_ num _ for a large pizza with cheese off of eatcu.com i got a large with half steak and half italian beef .
but back to my pizza , it was amazing .
i took _ num _ slices and and im not even hungry anymore .
5/5 stars a + last chicken fingers i had were a little salty and overfried .
plus , they charged me $ _ num _ for more sauce .
i did n't like this place .
this time i ordered a `` famous '' calzone .
ranch would be better .
i would n't really recommend delivery .
extra crispy what i did n't expect was for my order to take _ num _ .
this was one of my top places to go on campus .
done .
wrong orders , forgotten items , and slower-than-the-second-coming-of-christ delivery .
the only thing that kept us coming back was their awesome chicken strips .
so we paid in the store .
done .
might take awhile for your call to go through .
i would not recommend the pizza though , .
the bar downstairs is dark and dingy , i would not go there willingly .
pretty funny overall , the food was great that night , but yeah .
mug club _ num _ we used to come here after illini hockey games across the street .
there were surprisingly not that many people there on a weekend night .
the ones that were did n't really seem too obnoxious .
the mug club was a must for everybody .
just came across mine as i was scanning business cards .
upstairs , you would hear chanting about the need for a mop .
so i went to g-mart and they ordered it for me instead .
i really liked other realm .
the owner was funny and gregarious .
so i was needing some comics , man .
i asked if he was open and he led me right in .
that struck me as fair , and definitely do-able .
i was in this shop once when i was picking up my girlfriend .
i was just killing time and saw this shop .
your little model cars on the wall were filthy .
i came in by myself to pick up dinner for friends . )
called from marketplace mall area ... then she hung up on me without as much as a goodbye .
so , i ordered jimmy johns .
a little slow but the sandwich was amazing .
bread tasted great and everything was fresh .
once i ordered for delivery on a _ num _ january afternoon .
staff was all business and bursting with energy .
been _ num _ minutes .
i ordered delivery on a sunday night while finishing up some homework .
the online ordering was quite easy .
the billy club was roast beef and ham .
i added almost extra everything including sprouts , hot peppers , oregano and tomato .
they completely omitted the peppers which was disappointing .
after tax , tip and delivery fee my sandwich was over $ _ num _ .
granted , this was in _ num _ .
when i finally got it , it was drowned in vinaigrette .
we got a cat here .
so i am keeping my fingers crossed .
i adopted a dog a few months ago .
she even attacked one recently .
cchs did n't take great care of her either .
my family and i adopted two kittens from the shelter .
i felt like my pets were really cared for before we came along .
also super hot , like it cleared out my sinuses hot .
i just wanted something edible for lunch !
literally , i went orange eating it .
i worked here for a few months ( august until two days ago ) .
they definitely shrank in the _ num _ months i worked there .
i really enjoyed the authentic chinese food i had at lunch here .
the food tasted good and the service was very friendly and helpful .
got ta love this place .
i would not recommend this restaurant .
any food would suffer from sitting for an hour .
okay this place was said to be good .
ate here a while ago and did n't really like the food .
knew it was not going to be that great .
decided to go again because i wanted to try something different .
got this chinese fish dish that was just absolutely horrible .
i could make something better at home .
the husband and i went here for dinner takeout last night .
i was super impressed .
i ordered off the `` authentic '' ( ? )
it was delicious .
in spite of not particularly enjoying peppers i found myself stealing bites .
two people could easily eat here for $ _ num _ .
this place 's value rivals even mcdonald 's mcchickens .
the hot & spicy chicken was definitely good .
their tofu dish was also very good .
i got rice noodles .
the amount they gave me was jaw dropping .
and half the lunch box was made up of the rice aforementioned .
i would only come back for the green beans .
but why the hell would i do that ?
good for both american and chinese and always packed during lunch .
instead of the rice , i got noodles -- much better choice .
i got the green beans which are as good as ever .
i also got the mapo tofu which was good as well .
the chicken was n't totally gross this time !
i used to go there all the time for a quick and cheap lunch .
note that seating is limited so i would recommend getting takeout .
highly recommended .
ugh ... or should i say : eww ... i was trying to find a place to have dinner tonight .
pretty safe selection , one would think .
the problem was really with the basil chicken : it was honestly quite gross .
and the dish was just not good .
i ate a little bit of it and was done .
for the next half hour i had a gross taste in my mouth .
if they delivered ... i would have lived on this stuff in college .
however , given a choice , why go and have bad food ?
the mango sticky rice was terrific .
i would eat here about _ num _ times/week when i was in business school .
it was okay .
a good massage but i was n't impressed .
it was a little hot in the room .
i asked a deep tissue and got just a regular massage .
highly recommended !
the car was not ready when i arrived .
i had a great experience here and would recommend to anyone needing a car .
he would n't help me out in anyway and was just a terrible employee .
we were very satisfied with our vehicle and experience all throughout the trip .
i would say steer clear of these landlords .
i did n't even know that was possible .
you could do much worse than rick 's .
rick and his team did a great job in fixing my bmw convertible .
my car battery died and the hardtop convertible roof was in the trunk .
the car was n't starting when one tried to jump it as well .
overall a complicated situation which rick and his team handled really well .
would you like to do that today ? ''
why would i get a service that is n't recommended ?
the service was fast too and they vacuumed my car .
they stopped the upsell after that .
then , i started having performance problems with my tires .
the tires only had 30k miles on them and they were 60k tires .
they became unbalanced during pothole season .
they had to be replaced .
but , jiffy lube lost me as a customer .
when i complained the guy shrugged his shoulders and said sorry .
i would definitely recommend this jiffy lube over anywhere else .
plus they had the stuff that my chevy needed right then and there .
they had the doors open so it was nice to be in the lobby .
i brought bills to pay while i waited and could n't even finish .
they filled it up just to let me get home .
i was surprised to read the reviews on smoking/having a smokey car .
i really considered buying a drink just to throw it at them .
the food however , was underwhelming .
what was ordered : bento lunch box , teryaki chicken and sushi : spicy tuna was terrible .
the taste was lacking and the rice seemed a bit stale .
the food was tasty , and was presented very nicely .
we had a couple rolls , fried tempura appetizer , and gyoza .
we enjoyed it .
there were some downsides .
the price was very high compared to the amount of food we received .
also , we waited a very long time for our food .
we went for lunch and i ordered the chicken teriyaki box thing .
it was n't bad but it certainly was n't good either .
the salad came in the upper left square of the box .
it was about a _ num _ inch by _ num _ inch square .
what really cracked me up was the vegetables .
ive been here about _ num _ times .
there was one thing i did n't like ; fried salmon roll .
the breading was thick and greasy .
otherwise , food was good .
i had the sukiyaki and my girl had the beef teriyaki .
both of them were really good , especially hers .
the food was horrible .
and the service was the worst thing at this place .
never had sushi here kamakura consistently serves good food .
i stopped by at least once when i travel to u-c .
we came here to celebrate a birthday .
it was a cold weekday night and the restaurant was pretty empty .
i was very wrong .
we started out with an appetizer of tempura shrimp which was excellent and tasty .
i had the miso soup and it was spot on - goooood .
oh heavens , it was so good .
until now , i thought good sushi in champaign was wishful thinking .
good news : we were seated immediately .
instead , i received garbage that smelled and tasted like rotting fish .
when i got home , i tried to purge my mouth with listerine .
i thought that the sushi was very good .
i enjoyed the sushi rolls and sashimi .
the rolls were a good size and very fresh .
went on a tuesday night , no crowd at all .
i mostly got sushi rolls , and those were quite excellent .
would not recommend families .
one thing that really bothered me though was the sticky floors .
our food was very tasty , our chef was very personable and entertaining .
highly recommended !
also the manager checked on our table to make sure everything was going great .
i would suggest this place to anyone .
the ` open ' sign was on and clearly blinking ` open ' .
we asked to be seated at the grill .
we were refused service and told they were getting ready to close .
i did n't get to try the sushi but it sure looked good .
i had a bento box meal , teriyaki chicken , it was yummy .
i nice touch is they willing split the bill .
would totally recommend it .
it was strange and somewhat offensive .
do n't forget to get some green tea ice cream for dessert : ) came here for my friend 's birthday .
i heard great things about this place so i had high expectations .
needless to say , i was a bit disappointed .
the pros : the hibachi chef was very entertaining and friendly .
overall , the food was decent , service was not great ... not impressed i came here after graduating back in may and my experience was pretty lackluster .
went with a friend and got a bento box ( salmon teriyaki ) .
`` your order had a lot of complications ( ! )
we actually had to leave , i had an appointment . )
overpriced , mediocre sushi restaurant that only knows how to sell atmosphere and presentation .
it was very pretty , neat , and tidy inside .
i particularly liked the booths with glass tables .
it complimented the shades of blues on the booths .
it helped to show a little bit of culture .
their menus were detailed which helped a lot especially on their drinks menu .
although i did eye the japanese dish menus , i was set on sushi .
we ended up waiting over an hour for the sushi .
they were short staffed .
only one waiter was going around taking orders and delivering the food .
my friend got miso soup , eel roll , and tempura salmon roll .
i got a spicy scallop roll , philadelphia roll , and spicy salmon roll .
the miso was a bit salty .
the eel roll was tasty .
the tempura salmon roll was really cute .
it looked like little tofu squares .
i made a mistake by eating that first .
i thought that the pieces of fish in the sushi were a good size .
if i come back , i would try i did enjoy the dcor and small twists on the rolls though .
first off , there was no wait .
i did seem to take a little too long for my food .
i ordered unagi , ummm , it melted in my mouth !
the ahi was good and the spider roll as well .
this place officially became my go-to birthday dinner _ num _ years ago .
my below average bento box cost a total of $ _ num _ too .
had a great experience .
adam was our teppan chef and he was amazing .
food was deliciously seasoned and cooked to perfection .
i left feeling satisfyingly full and in good spirits .
on a saturday evening , we waited _ num _ minutes without anyone taking our orders .
waited another _ num _ minutes , still no one to take our order .
so we walked out .
everyone in the restaurant was waiting for his or her food .
this was on saturday .
7:35 pm arrived and got seated immediately 7:50 pm got our waters and `` a server will be with you shortly '' 7:51-7:59 pm tried to understand what the word `` shortly '' meant 8 pm walked out we went to sushi kame and we received way more attentive service .
i might visit kamakura again `` shortly '' .
went to lunch there today and it was awesome as usual .
my friend and i went there and order ramen .
first time my wife and i came here the service was awful !
we saw our waiter twice the entire time we were there .
we had to hunt the waiter down to get our check !
went again the 2nd time hoping the service was better ... .
we could all smell trash while sitting there .
we ordered drinks and the glass was filled half way !
we arrived at 5 pm and we left at 7 pm .
waiters and waitresses who do n't care drinks filled half glass hibachi food tasted burnt one bathroom stall trash smelling atmosphere the good : sushi food was good , tristan was a fine chef .
tried to take my wife for a birthday dinner .
called for a reservation at 8 pm and did n't get seated until 9:15 pm .
we decided to go elsewhere .
adam at the teppan table was fantastic .
everything was really good .
i would defiantly get thier house dressing .
on a down note , our waitress was kind of slow .
pros : - the staff was very friendly and tried to be helpful .
- they did n't have a lot of what i was looking for .
also wanted purple gloves , which they did n't have either .
i would imagine there is nothing else like it in downstate illinois .
so i went with it .
the exam seemed quick but thorough .
my glasses were ready in an hour .
they seemed to have a pretty decent selection of designer frames .
i went in here for a regular annual eye-exam .
i was recently at this location and the staff there was friendly and courteous .
they helped me in all aspects of getting my glasses .
i was impressed with the knowledge and experience they have .
the staff was very friendly , especially dr. sanders .
definitely a great experience and i would highly recommend this place .
my appointment was for glasses .
most of the frames were name brand super expensive .
she charged me an extra $ _ num _ for that .
i felt completely lied to and robbed .
after i left , i noticed that there were scratch marks on the metal !
i went to another store and they adjusted my glasses by warming them up .
did illini eye not have the capabilities to do that ?
i really appreciated that .
dr. sanders helped me with the rest of the eye exams .
maybe because they did n't want to do business with me .
i spent m it was such bad luck that i went to the location .
this was bothersome , as i prefer how i look in contacts . )
i thought it was just another attrition that comes with the aging process .
this tactic worked brilliantly for me with regard to contact lenses .
( ha - loved this ! )
would highly recommend - will be back for my next exam !
i had a fish sandwich combo here , and i was pretty unimpressed .
it did n't have a lot of flavor .
their okra was good , though .
but the fried chicken was not that good .
it was really dry .
when i walked in it was not a welcoming atmosphere .
they acted like i was bothering them and i felt rushed to order .
i would n't rec .
i was told that the main place in chambana is seaboat .
instead of fries , i got greens .
the flavor was right .
the service was very friendly as well .
we were so aggravated we really wanted to leave or ask for a refund .
once we finally tasted the food we were glad we did n't .
accompanying sides of fried okra and mac n cheese were on spot .
good tartar sauce but not enough given .
the chicken was n't the best i 've had , but still pretty good .
everything was perfectly fried and included _ num _ sides and a roll .
we also got an order of catfish nuggets ( $ _ num _ ) .
now those were goooood .
i had the fish and chips with either whiting or walleye .
the menus were confusing - wall menu said walleye and printed menu said whiting .
fries were average , could have been crispier .
potato salad was of the finely chopped creamy variety .
it reminded me a bit of a waldorf salad but was refreshing .
my companion had two pieces of fried chicken and declared it good .
we were there when the place was n't busy .
small tables in the dining area were covered in sticky none-too-clean plastic tablecloths .
we ordered take-out and went across the street to hessel park .
the catfish was good , but just good .
the roll was unnecessary , green beans were decent/standard , fries were alright .
overall , the meal was meh .
highly recommended !
it was neither .
good food , fried fish , fried chicken .
did not have the collards or okra .
it was good food but a little too greasy for my taste .
i placed our order for take out and sat down and wait .
the food was just sitting on the counter .
went here , was n't aware of what time they close .
when we pulled up the neon sign was lit up and said open .
the door was unlocked .
so we went in and wasted _ num _ min .
if i could give _ num _ stars i would , or maybe even negative stars .
the driver was unable to find my house and called twice for directions .
i went fried catfish fillets , fried okra , and collards .
fish and chicken cooked to order , so definitely be ready to wait .
would not recommend this restaurant !
got ta try it at least once .
** closed ** so sad but the seaboat has sailed away .
this champaign landmark was in business for _ num _ years .
also so long to the staff , you were like family .
this time , we had a really nice friendly waitress .
it was disgusting .
the textures were waxy and the cheese was lardlike .
while the flavors were bold , they tasted man-made and had a processed mouth-feel .
it was to real food what velveeta is to real cheese .
i was a bit confused on their use of host and hostesess .
jeff was awesome !
made us feel very welcome .
she apologized and said no one had told her that we were there .
i ordered bruschetta and salad and my companions had soup and salad .
but the bruschetta was just awful .
salad did have pepperoncini peppers , which were a nice touch .
the waitress was polite but seemed to be either new or overwhelmed .
she never refilled any of our drinks and just seemed sort of distracted .
we left her a nice tip though .
commercial italian - had a gift card so needed to use it .
moderately priced value for what is presented and always something to bring home no apology , nothing .
i had soup & salad the other person had alfredo .
not complicated to pour some sauce on the noodles !
had to ask for drink & salad/bread refils .
overpriced just `` okay '' italian food .
went with a friend recently . )
other than that , their smoked mozarella fonduta was pretty good .
the service was the worst i have had in some time .
at that very same time our main entree came out .
i then ordered another drink .
one bite in we realized the cheese had separated and it was barely warm .
we had a gift card and we were crusing through on a road trip .
alexis was great .
she was new .
thought she did well .
service was relatively slow .
the service was good ( even though the waiter was a bit awkward ) .
my fiance took me here for my birthday in august .
we were immediately seated , so far so good .
we were n't feeling good about this .
nuts and bolts : went with the family to celebrate a birthday .
pros : everybody left content and very full .
our waiter kept the breadsticks and salad coming .
multiple orders of soup were taken .
great price - got all that food for around $ _ num _ plus tip .
our waiter was very attentive and made us laugh a few times .
minestrone was ok .
he was wonderful .
the only bright side of this dinner was the pleasant waitress .
our pizza was mushy and undercooked .
i could n't eat it .
the description was nothing like the actual entree .
our poor waiter was so over worked .
the blond female manager had sent people home and they then got a rush .
the funny as heck black bald waiter we had was the best .
he handled _ num _ tables with grin and a joke for each .
he was as fast as he could be .
the food was okay .
but our waier honestly made the visit as good as it was .
i ordered the steak medallion gorgonzola fettuccine alfredo .
unfortunately , not a good cut of beef as they were tough and chewy .
he was funny , attentive , and kind ... yes .
we visited 6/6/15 around 6:30-7 .
we were seated right away .
we waited about _ num _ mins just to order lemonade .
our cups sat empty for most of our meal .
we did n't have enough time for our app .
we explained what happened and we were understanding because the server was relatively new .
the manager comped our entire meal .
food was good but our waitress keisha s. was not friendly at all .
we had to practically beg for refills .
we had to wait about _ num _ minutes on a tuesday night to be seated .
we were seated and i was quite indecisive about what to get .
i settled on a build-your-own-pasta with alfredo/cream sauce and added italian sausage .
i did not like the sausage .
the thing that really upset me about the experience though was the service .
we looked at each other and both agreed this meal was unnecessarily rushed .
asking us what we would like to chose between an apple dish or lemon cake .
joey was seriously excellent . )
she never made us feel like we were in a rush to leave .
i asked for my salad with no olives , it had olives .
i asked for meat sauce with my ravioli , i got red sauce .
i asked for a refill on my drink , never got one .
she came to our table maybe _ num _ times total .
water cup tasted soapy _ num _ .
utensils not cleaned properly _ num _ .
the garlic and wine sauce was really heavy and not appetizing .
the garlic bread were super greasy and honestly not very good _ num _ .
( side note : the breadsticks were freaking beautiful ; inside and out . )
the taste though , was n't terrible , but was just average .
nothing exulted pizzazz ; so it was just eh .
they had a great selection , and fantastic service .
i got everything i needed quickly and efficiently and with interesting conversation .
my husband found the shoes he was looking for .
the sales associate was funny and interactive .
my grand daughter loved her shoes and would not take them off .
she said she looked like a fashion girl : ) a little shop on the triangle where neil street and walnut streets converge .
they made great use of the space .
a friend gave me a tip : their columbian coconut coffee ( wonderful ! )
me : i thought you closed at _ num _ !
lost a star for having tea that expired a year ago !
the golden moon tea does n't taste like anything i bought from golden moon .
the teas i bought from the jar taste stale and bad .
i also loved the array of chocolate they had .
it would make a great place to go to find some uniquely delicious gifts .
so many of my favorite elements come together in this store .
got tea ?
went to visit this place for the first time yesterday and i was impressed .
i bought a couple ounces and ca n't wait to try it !
found this place on accident while in town for work .
the wait was interminable as a result .
i stopped in here and got a bag of my favorites .
you chose to work there , treat the customers with some respect and patience !
i just wished they were a little bigger and stocked more things .
pros : clean , well stocked cons : prices more expensive than chinatown , chicago .
sadly , most of their constituency would n't care or notice .
was sadly disappointed .
sadly no other steak cut options .
i had a great dinner experience .
the service was more than attentive .
had a really nice glass of wine .
just the way i wanted it .
great on all counts except the decor could really use updating .
the ribeye was a low grade supermarket cut .
we arrived around 4:15 .
noticed there were quite a few people already there .
that not being a problem we were promptly seated .
and she certainly ate her worth of $ _ num _ salad bar and more .
anyway , i ordered the _ num _ oz .
when it came out on the sizzling skillet it was more like well done .
it was hard to cut and totally dried out .
my server noticed that i was n't happy and offered to get another one .
the salad bar was good .
it was moist and delicious .
when i was there the restaurant was very busy and extremely noisy .
perhaps a hamburger or meatloaf type order would be safer .
coleslaw would be on par with that available in a chain supermarket deli .
update : had to go again because my aunt is insane .
knowing how bad the steak is , i ordered the shrimp .
would highly recommed the ribeye for a classy , illini-themed restaurant any day .
ive tried ribeye at other places and arnt that good .
we did not make a reservation and walked in .
seeing we were not leaving , the hostess seated us within _ num _ minutes .
this was a friday evening .
our waitress was extremely pleasant and took great care of us .
we ordered a beer on tap and of course , the ribeye .
the salad bar was great , but way too small .
i ordered the _ num _ oz .
ribeye while my husband ordered the _ num _ oz .
it was a good cut of meat and well-aged but it was just good .
with two steaks and two beers our bill was $ _ num _ .
i was impressed .
we had the ribeye , shrimp and chicken entrees .
all were very good .
the service was very good .
the salad bar was excellent .
they had a delicious assortment of salads and pasta and even some fruit .
i had the chicken and shrimp meal and it was also delicious .
overpriced for the quality .
would go back only for the salad bar .
`` what would you get ? ''
first time out of maybe a hundred i did n't get a good recommendation .
it was going towards medium well .
the salad bar was the only redeeming quality .
plus the peal at the bottom was rock hard so i could eat it .
i got the 10oz ribeye and it was a perfect medium rare .
service was good no real complaints there .
the small loaves of bread were hot coming to the table .
i had one slice - average .
the best thing going on was the salad bar and even it lacked .
by that i mean the lettuce was tired .
however a good variety of other things were there .
and that it was walking distance from the hotel .
what i did n't expect was a thin cut of ribeye .
it was prepared exactly as i ordered but there was n't much flavor .
service was good and its walking distance from the hotel .
the twice baked potato was very good .
the steak was good as well .
salad bar was all you can eat with a decent selection of toppings .
i ordered mine medium , expecting a juicy , pink center .
i ordered the steak fries , which were n't seasoned at all .
the decor was hilarious incongruous with the prices .
the service was great , and the staff were very accommodating .
the ribeye said it was no problem .
the salad bar was good too .
our server , ashleigh , was attentive and personable .
danica my server was very attentive and knowledgeable .
great salad bar and the twice baked potato was full of flavor .
otherwise , i would never go here .
admittedly been years since ate there but not much seasoning on steak .
salad bar was good .
even with the full house we did not have a long wait .
the clientele was a mixture of older couples and slightly depressed game goers .
i had not seen those things since the grade school cafeteria !
i ordered a _ num _ oz .
so ordered the _ num _ oz .
they were not bad , but they were not sauted .
seriously , my steak looked like it belonged on a philly cheesesteak .
came here because it was close to my hotel .
steak was below average and service was lacking .
i would not return .
why did it take us so long to discover old time ?
oh and did i mention the twice baked potatoes ?
awesome meat case with great steaks , marinated chicken and homemade sausage .
just wish they were open on sunday so i could load up my cooler !
once , i had them get me some quail .
i came here looking for salmon and was really really impressed .
it certainly tasted like that . )
i love this store , i found my kind of clothes there .
the store was clean and so where the dressing rooms .
i ca n't wait to go back there.i could spend hundreds of dollars there .
very nice , yet crowded kohls .
i purchased the fila work shoes .
it was weird .
mine was from rain .
so , i got _ num _ new shirts .
again , i walked with _ num _ shirts .
i also got _ num _ new pairs of trousers ( who still says trousers ? )
i got some new white socks , and some new plain black tshirts .
so that was nice .
highly recommended if you have tons of questions .
so , went there the first time and thought the manager was great !
called and complained about the situation .
they could n't even offer anything else !
best pet store ive been too .
friendly , knowledgeable , efficient and decently priced .
i still bought the dechlorinator , though .
i got my first gold fish for my start up aquarium from here .
some reviews mentioned too pricey and customer wait time to get help .
i said if i could help it we would not spend money there anymore .
unfortunately we had a gift certificate .
i could say the same thing of the owner , john .
you ca n't beat the service here and the prices were fair .
i would suggest that knitters near and far visit this gem .
spent quite a while in here and loved it .
really enjoyed my visit here .
this free service saved me money for a service call .
dropped in on a random tuesday night .
these guys did it right .
drove back to autozone to return the jump starter and buy the battery .
both displayed excellent customer service , which is not so common these days .
highly recommended - with a shout out for their fantastic customer service !
big city diamond quality and selection with great local family owned service !
i got married !
in that short , frantic time , we kept thinking , `` hmm .
so we ended up going to browne 's the tuesday before the sunday wedding .
she told us she 'd have them in by friday .
which we did , and it was beautiful .
the prices were good , considering the current market for gold .
i 've been married for _ num _ years now , engaged for over _ num _ .
they found a loose diamond !
i left my rings with them .
their selection and quality would be hard to find anywhere else in town .
* edit * since i wrote this , i picked up my rings .
the setting was fixed and the metal was replated on both rings .
the replating and the fixed setting did n't cost me a dime .
never even came out of his hole in the back .
i went here to have a battery changed in my watch .
went to sell my jewelry and they gave a fair price .
it took several phone calls and an in-person meeting to get my money back .
they were extremely rude when my roommate and i called them .
i moved in to my apartment on august _ num _ .
when i opened the door the stench was overpowering .
honestly , i sprinted to the window to start airing it out .
it smelled like the last tenant was someone with _ num _ cats .
and that was nothing compared to the fact it was so so dirty .
there were even stains on the walls .
i moved in on a saturday afternoon .
i spent saturday night in a smelly apartment with no power .
she told me to call my landlord .
i now had power .
lived in _ num _ n busey and regretted every single day .
first they gave trashy apartment without cleaning .
while i spent _ num _ days on cleaning it when moved out .
i could challenge them to show even little sign of dirt .
the apartment was dirty when we moved in .
and the rain dropped in our apartment .
every time they said they 'll come and fix it but they never did .
by the way , a raccoon came to our living place a day ago .
we tried really hard to keep it away .
i thought it was a thief break in !
lastly , my friend come to visit me in summer .
so my friend parked at an empty lot .
so who called to tow the car ?
and i got a notice from the landlord not my car get towed .
for a while , everything i had to furnish/decorate my house was from there .
finally , five weeks after this first began , i flipped .
perhaps it was all the coffee at aroma .
and i thought , `` what the hell am i gon na do now ?
i paid $ _ num _ for a piece of outdated , racist iconography .
i emancipated mammy .
you will find a part of you you thought you 'd lost .
it was kind of like walking through a museum .
i found my boyfriend a silk shirt for ten bucks .
apparently i came for opening weekend of their new store .
i decided to investigate .
this store relocated to lincoln square in to a new space .
hence why people were munching outside .
i could co-own a store !
did ya look down the hallway , asshole ?
some other tribe of marketing-for-dummies-reading diarrhea-variety-shit-for-brains idiots already jumped on that loser train .
maybe it was the overall lack of options .
the people were n't friendly or helpful .
i used to be more impressed with the common ground food co-op .
it was infuriating .
i had to ignore her behavior constantly .
common grounds selection seemed very average .
we unexpectedly found ourselves about _ num _ miles north of urbana for a week .
i 'll definitely be back , and might consider becoming an owner .
wish i lived closer , i would go there alot more .
i shopped here one year ago for couple of times .
i decided to become an `` organic '' vegan in early october .
i went there 11/8 .
but , they all locally grown or organic .
the new cafe in the store was great .
friendly service and the food was very tasty .
i would highly recommend the hot roast beef sandwich with carmelized onions .
the expansion did a lot for their prices in the way of shelf items .
i even got a recommendation of one employee 's favorite kale .
my wife grew up in the urbana-area .
inspired , hearty , so good .
today , it decided it did n't want to be read .
eventually she said it was on the house .
i might do it again .
took a cooking class making chard and mushroom pasta .
besides being given the recipe for this dish , the instructor had additional handouts .
we would otherwise have to buy those two items online .
very happy someone at the market told me about this place on saturday .
stopped in to get some dates , hummus , guac , & salsa .
the staff seemed really nice .
the next day my radiator tank was completely empty .
truly a dishonest and compromised garage .
hard to find the departments you needed - they could improve layout and signage .
never did see the men 's shoe department .
improvements needed in the top department - i was looking for more casual items .
also the owner & staff were extremely helpful .
i lucked out and found this while working in champaign .
ridiculously overpriced .
do n't come here .
i definitely did n't feel welcome .
they gave me the run around .
i would give it zero stars if thats an option !
we showed up at 7:50 am .
there were around _ num _ people waiting !
we were stranded at the bus stop for _ num _ hours in the cold wind !
it was chaotic as people jostled each other to get on the bus .
it also smelled a lot like weed when i got off one night .
been in here to look for stencils .
they did n't carry any .
prices seemed about right for a privately owned art shop .
super helpful owner and staff even checked manufacturers ' sites to confirm acid-free .
and then you would n't be full of so much negative energy .
what else could you need ?
i took in two down-filled winter coats , they took about _ num _ days .
i went in for their fluff and fold service .
i used the fluff and fold service _ num _ times .
the first time , i was missing some pants .
so that forced me to go there again .
the first time occurred a few months ago .
the second time occurred this week .
my husband brought in a suit and a $ _ num _ coupon .
the fee for the suit was $ _ num _ .
well , they charged him once for $ _ num _ and again for $ _ num _ !
i drove down there with receipts .
tony , the manager , said his records show i was refunded ... twice .
on the hanger was a tag noting that it was to simply be pressed .
i brought the dress to starcrest just to see what they could do .
they got the stains out and saved the day !
i killed one that was on one of my washers with a dryer sheet .
when i went to pick up my dry cleaning , the cover was gone .
kinda expensive but they did a good job .
this was maybe the best dental experience i 've ever had .
i actually really learned a lot !
it was a totally lovely experience .
the building and office might not be the newest , but really who cares ?
i also really appreciated that he was n't pushing expensive treatments and add-ons .
then i called allied .
they kept calling each other `` sir , '' that cracked me up .
i used their moving service for my move to south carolina .
they were professional , helpful and punctual .
they wrapped all my furniture and packed it carefully .
we had only _ num _ broken item which was a metal shoe rack .
great movers and i will use them again if i could give these movers a zero , i would .
so we used these folks -- it was a disaster from the beginning .
when we got to atlanta the guys moved everything into place .
after two hours the movers never showed .
despite all the haggling no one ever apologized .
absolute waste of time contacting allied .
the phone lackey bragged about their bbb rating .
she promised a quote the next day , which i never received .
no one from allied ever contacted me again .
if i could rate this company zero stars , i would .
i got an awesome _ num _ 's vinyl couch for _ num _ $ !
they recently started taking credit via square reader in their new downtown champaign location .
did i really start this review like that ?
the regular waitress was awesome and knew what we wanted .
got the t-shirt .
i also went to the other newer location in downtown champaign .
and more amazed you loved it .
the food was just okay , nothing to rave about .
merry ann 's version paled in comparison .
i gave them another shot a few weeks later , this time for lunch .
the peas were from a can .
then i looked at the merry ann 's menu and .
i was very impressed with that .
i ended up waiting ten more minutes after we had finished our other food .
but the pancakes were delicious -- fluffy and wonderful .
the orange juice was terrible .
it was room temperature when she served it .
the food was pretty standard .
my special came with a very large portion of hash browns .
or i could be projecting .
he had the diner stack , biscuit on the bottom , eggs scrambled .
i had _ num _ eggs over medium with bacon , hashbrowns , and toast .
service was excellent .
our waitress was very friendly , and our food arrived promptly .
their $ _ num _ orange juice is pulp-less , watered down concentrate .
crispy yet soft , i could 've had platters of this thing .
what went wrong ?
wow i also got a biscuit to go with it .
eggs so fresh you 'd think they had the chickens out back .
highly recommended .
and you might only gain one pound .
i enjoyed everything about it .
i liked that they always asked if we wanted our checks split .
i liked the menus that never changed , except for when they got laminated .
i liked watching the cooks assemble a stack like an artist at work .
but to me it was more than just that .
the time i spent at merry ann 's was always ... comforting .
walked into merry-ann 's for breakfast on saturday .
there was no sign to indicate method of seating .
i stood there while several staff stood idly behind the counter .
they looked me in the eye but never acknowledged my presence .
i waited a bit and then left .
i went to merry-ann 's for the first time on sunday morning .
i also got a half-order of gravy and a biscuit , plus a coffee .
the bacon was by far the most disappointing part of the meal .
it was just flavorless and gross .
everything else made up for it , though .
the hilton razed the restaurant as part of its renovation .
i could of ate cheaper at home with the same ingredients .
restaurant review i would have to say that the wait staff is top notch .
the hashbrown were oily , no real crispy to it .
the sausage and eggs were good without complaint .
overall with the oil and salt , it was somewhat difficult to eat .
this time , we went to the merry ann 's on neil street .
server was very nice about remaking it .
the customer service was just that bad .
the front door had greasy finger/hand-prints all over it .
when i pointed it out to the waitress , she just shrugged .
this place was so good .
almost reminded me of the waffle house back at home .
it was clean and the service was so nice .
so i ordered the first picture i saw that looked appetizing - fish tacos .
but our waiter sucked .
he actually yawned while repeating our order .
the salad was good and so were the bread sticks .
however , we were not asked if we wanted more .
the server was invisible .
every time we wanted something we could not find our server .
he also took my salad before i was done with .
he just took it .
he did n't bother to ask me if i was done with it .
he just snatched it while i was n't looking .
there was still a lot left .
but , we were there for over an hour .
they were so slow .
they were really salty and just ... well , not good .
we also split a burger , which was decent , but very very heavy .
i was just excited that my side salad was n't all iceberg - bonus !
absolutely the best fried chicken in town .
i came with a couple of friends and ordered a frozen margarita .
her reaction was what soured the experience .
she did , and the meal was fine .
i had a cheeseburger and fries , and it was pretty good .
i liked the fried green bean appetizer with wasabi ranch sauce quite a bit .
the real shock came at the end of the meal .
yesterday , i ordered carryout chipotle yucatan salad for lunch .
the menu said the salad included cilantro and avocado .
i got exactly _ num _ tiny chunks of avocado and zero cilantro .
in addition , it was a hot mess .
i would recommend it to my friends .
the arrival of our food was the second disappointment of the night .
the best example of this was one of my friend 's pasta dishes .
needless to say , he finished it but still went home hungry .
why would you choose t.g.i .
the service was bad and the food was worse .
we got the _ num _ for $ _ num _ deal .
i ordered some sort of pasta alfredo with chicken .
it was one of the smallest portions i 've ever gotten in a restaurant .
the pasta was so overcooked it was mushy .
the chicken was so overcooked i could barely cut into it .
closed .
well i forgot i had posted that it was closed .
i managed to get them to come back to champaign , il they are now located up by the market place mall .
still , it was pretty good .
we also had two glasses of french hard apple cider : delicious .
we went to carmon 's for sunday brunch and the place was packed !
so packed , in fact , that the service suffered noticeably .
well , i got the alone time , not so much the scrumptious meal .
the $ _ num _ side salad was lovely .
a nice change of pace for brunch -- simple selections done well .
we especially loved the complimentary bread with butter with smoked sea salt -- - delicious .
the escargots were quite good as well .
everything was either really , really good or really , really bad .
it was pretty trashy for the otherwise very nice atmosphere .
all portions were generous , perfectly cooked and quick to the table .
the creamed spinach was smooth , sophisticated and rich .
and it was .
did i mention the totally funky cool decor and friendly staff ?
it was absolutely amazing !
carmon 's is the restaurant gem hidden away in champaign .
i also had some coffee which was obviously fresh-brewed .
the waitress was kind and attentive and the atmosphere was laid back .
so i expected slow service .
the food was standard .
and i asked for cheddar on top - what the hell ?
$ _ num _ for shitty american shredded cheese ?
beautifully decorated .
the one thing that was good was the crepe suzette .
we were placed in the corner of the restaurant too .
she then disappeared for the entire meal and came back only for the check .
we left the discount card on the table .
walking in , we had a good feeling .
i ordered a $ _ num _ ham and cheese crepe .
once they took his empty soup bowl away , the wait began .
we were not encouraged .
we probably did not get our food for another 20-30 minutes .
and again , there were _ num _ other parties of _ num _ in the restaurant .
while we waited , no one came to update us .
no one even looked at us .
mine was unevenly heated and very salty .
we each ordered coffee , which took about _ num _ minutes to bring out .
the whipped cream was also made fresh and delightful .
the prices were horrid though .
service was relaxed and friendly but not slow .
my parents both enjoyed the coffee .
we went for dinner on a sunday night .
we were three of five customers in the restaurant , which was off-putting .
the crepes were great .
the service was great .
was quite jolly .
it was an excellent choice and certainly unique .
the waiter was comical and super friendly , and the service was perfect .
i sampled the quiche and my own breakfast-esque version of a crepe .
both were delicious .
i also enjoyed the complimentary bread & butter with roasted sea salt .
went here for a weekend brunch with my boyfriend a few weeks ago now .
both our crepes were delicious !
things not to miss : curried cauliflower soup split pea soup the pate/salad plate and any crepe with `` two fried eggs '' on top .
so i liked carmon 's .
i would assign it a few demerits , but mostly gold stars .
i would like to try more crepes at a future visit .
it was just very laid back and , well , french !
the stroganoff crepe was delicious , as was the nutella crepe for dessert .
to our delight , they shifted us there without a fuss .
highly recommended !
today i had a wonderful goat cheese quiche .
it was the special and came with a salad .
unfortunately , i had no room left for one of their delicious dessert crepes .
we had a super afternoon at carmon 's !
we stumbled across carmon 's on our way from chicago to new orleans .
houdini performed there back in the day !
i took my children here while visiting my sister in champaign .
i was expecting something along the lines of the normal children 's museum .
it was nothing like it .
the place was dark and dingy .
it needed a thorough cleaning .
i was afraid to let my children play with the toys there .
we could barely fill up _ num _ minutes here .
the water interactive display had no water in it .
the sand exhibit was missing some sand .
my family came here saturday for the willy wonka chocolate experience - what a joke !
upon entering the main room to pay , the cost was $ 9/person .
i was wrong .
there were about _ num _ people crammed into the main room , paying .
charlie and the chocolate factory was playing , but there was no volume .
there was nothing resembling the chocolate factory .
that was the first experience .
why did they even need the bag ?
where were the oompa loompas and chocolate ?
the only chocolate i saw was a drawing of a chocolate fountain .
the whole thing took less than 1/2 hour .
we complained and were reluctantly given our money back .
this was a joke - do not take your kids here .
to begin with , the place was dirty .
it looked like no one cared about it .
there were no exhibits , few play stations and fewer that actually worked .
there was absolutely nothing to commend itself about this place .
what toys they had were either broken or of little entertainment value .
and our allergies started to act up .
we had such a great morning at this children 's museum !
our visit lasted about _ num _ hours and i recommend this as a family destination !
i would n't recommend it .
we came as a family outing over the holidays .
my three kids 9,7 , and _ num _ found plenty to interest them .
a birthday party was just wrapping up while we waited for opening time .
my teenage daughter and i really enjoyed the momentum machine on the lower level .
we were so dizzy but kept trying it out over and over again !
that did n't deter us from trying everything though !
laid back .
laid back place .
i ordered the chilequiles , which i 'm a bit particular about .
and i was delighted . '
t was nice to see a cool , friendly environment .
i was delighted .
this was awful .
base on the reviews from this site we decided to check it out .
when the food showed up it was just as bland as the chips .
it was the straw that broke the camel 's back .
this place was poppin !
we had to park in the dallas and co .
overall , the food though was n't that great .
three stars for the food , and an extra for the great margaritas ; i picked _ num _ stars , which means , according to yelp , `` yay !
our server was really nice and attentive .
last night we went there and i got chicken tacos .
they were so horrible that i only took one bite .
they were that bad .
the chicken tasted like it was canned .
i was disappointed .
the ambience was fine .
it was bright and kitschy in ways i find endearing .
a soggy fry job on a cimichanga : death warmed over .
ordered a carnitas burrito with beans and rice .
this place reminded me of burrito king .
tried the fish filet dinner with rice/pinto beans .
it was great , and way too much !
friend did n't like the black beans much though .
my husband had the mixed fajitas , and enjoyed them .
portion was huge , and we brought about half of it home .
i had the pozole and alex taco .
both were flavorful .
pozole had a nice amount of spice .
the rice was drenched in grease .
it even smelled bad as the waiter put it in front of me .
i actually gasped .
the salsas were good .
had the vegetarian fajitas , and my wife had the chicken burrito .
we both had the black beans .
back in those days , i had not yet been to many authentic taquerias .
so i thought fiesta was amazing .
but then again , i also thought dos res was awesome .
i became a bit of a mexican restaurant snob .
i moved away , had many many amazing mexican dishes during my travels .
moved back to cu a couple years ago .
done !
would not return : ( i ordered the chiles rellenos and was pretty disappointed .
ingredients seemed low-quality and overall preparation was subpar .
everything was drowned in a red sauce that tasted canned .
however , our server was a really nice guy .
my beef burrito was mostly beans and almost no beef .
$ _ num _ pacifico beer was a plus .
chips and salsa - bad had to sprinkle salt on em for flavor !
lol the cebollitos on the tacos were so amazing !
not very authentic , and my rice was severely undercooked .
they used yellow cheese on my tacos .
i came here pretty often my junior year at the u of i .
been going here since they first opened more than _ num _ years ago .
what attracted me the most was their ( huge ) margarita menu .
first of all , the drank .
it was delicious .
the food tasted great , but it was n't exactly authentic .
always wanted to try this place .
met friends here .
shared the asada relleno meal , chile relleno , and horchata .
loved their horchata ; very milky .
it came with free refills .
liked the meat in the asada relleno .
the chile relleno was good , a bit sour .
our server was very friendly .
service was 4 ~ 5 star .
we ordered a horchata , a burrito dinner and the el presidente .
the horchata was so good !
i used to work in new mexico and really enjoyed new mexican food .
i liked the chicken taco in the el presidente .
the chicken was very juicy .
however , the steak in my enchilada was on the drier side .
each dish could be two meals for an adult .
would love to try their margaritas in my next visit .
my experience with amtrak was surprisingly pleasant .
once it was delayed four hours .
i was not happy .
except wish i had invested in a good pair of noise-canceling headphones .
the bus took over four hours .
a _ num _ foot winnebago would cost about $ _ num _ .
did i mention i 'm having a slow day at work ?
but the reason i went for four stars was one man : `` mr .
i was definitely disappointed there .
come on , now ) .
last time i took amtrak anywhere it was to chicago from champaign .
the crew on the trains were always very pleasant and eager to please .
the food in the diner car was outstanding .
train arrived over an hour late : ( .
but that staff there were nice and helpful .
andy 's towed the car within _ num _ minutes of the call .
all these problems melted away , however , when we tried sam 's .
even my middle eastern friend was impressed .
the food was good though .
small chicken breast pieces , fried in a garlic sauce .
recommended .
a mixture of some sort and then fried , tasted strange .
by far the best food they had .
it was ok .
it was ok .
they were friendly and nice people .
oh well , i ordered it anyway .
it was very good and piping hot .
we each ordered a breakfast special and then split an order of french toast .
it was a tasty breakfast on a cold , rainy day .
our total was about as pleasing as the french toast .
the food was fast and good .
the food was great .
bacon was fresh and the right balance of crispy without being overdone .
but really , why would you be ?
full meals for under $ _ num _ ... how could you resist ?
i went here for breakfast and i was quite happy .
i had a bacon and cheese omelette and hash browns .
it was inexpensive and very tasty .
for a while they served lebonese food on some evenings but stopped doing that .
it was excellent , high quality and reasonably priced .
did you know the specials are here at the top ?
did you read what i wrote there ?
it was definitely pretty amazing .
basically hash browns , they were delicious .
still , we were in and out within an hour .
it felt cramped .
once we settled into our little nook i felt more comfortable .
this hole-in-the-wall was a great find .
service was fast and friendly , customers were a little gruff , but nice .
food was great for this greasy spoon .
we had t-bone steaks and french toast for breakfast .
not a long wait for anything and reasonably priced .
so glad i remembered seeing yelp reviews of sam 's .
the kids split an order of french toast and i had the breakfast special .
service was perfunctory but that could be owing to the place being so busy .
coffee was decent .
ordered the western omelet .
the american fries were a soggy mess and also without flavor .
did these reviewers eat the same stuff as i did ?
there was nothing remotely commendable about it .
it was soggy and relatively flavorless .
i tried it with and without syrup .
french toast was hidden like a pancake .
we all agreed that it was fantastic and full of charm .
i ordered the ribeye and eggs breakfast with a half order of french toast .
regardless of how its made , its wonderful .
met sam as he was busy at the grill .
paul and i went in to order some burgers .
the staff was very attentive .
i borrowed a pen to start my food diary .
i noticed a saint perched above the grill .
he offtered to share one with me for protection .
he said i should place it above a door way of my home .
the coffee was really good too and my bacon and eggs were delicious .
pancakes were my favorite !
the server was very friendly , and the food was brought out quickly .
we two ppl ordered _ num _ things .
we were completely disappointed and frustrated afterwards .
so we sat down and the service was just terrible .
he talked way too fast and barely gave us time to respond .
did n't like him at all .
it was edible , sure , but delicious ?
* another problem we had here .
all i had was coffee cause i 'm not a huge breakfast kinda guy ... but the coffee was awesome !
the rest of the gang ordered omelettes , and french toast and both looked superb .
that meant that we waited around fifty minutes for our food .
it might look run down or old , but everything looked clean .
the server was nice and attentive .
my husband always ordered denver omelette where we were here .
i was skeptical the french toast could be the best in the world .
they were amazing , perfect and the best ive ever had .
stopped through champaign on our way back to iowa from indiana .
whole family had breakfast .
every item ordered rocked !
french toast was unlike any i 've eaten ... was simply amazing !
well , the waiter was really nice .
stood in there for twenty minutes before anyone noticed us .
four tables without people , all covered with plates and trash .
we were told it would be awhile because there were no tables .
the wait person was prompt and friendly .
the food was just s bit too greasy and eggs were over cooked .
it was amazing , to say the least .
i ordered eggs , sausage and gus ' famous french toast .
this was the best tasting panfrench-cake toast i ever had .
they fixed a broken door handle on my car .
and they delivered .
they repaired the right side of my car which sustained multiple dents .
central il auto body did a wonderful job fixing my car .
i had extensive damage to the roof of my new toyota .
they replaced and repaired everything to perfect condition !
kept me informed through the entire process which was an added benefit .
definitely recommended !
charlie at central il auto body was very courteous and thorough during my estimate .
highly recommended .
brought my mom 's car in .
i expected to pick it up the next day .
they had it ready to go in just over an hour .
the mushroom cheeseburger was my favorite , and the fries - oh .
i would give my left arm for a murphy burger on some days .
however , they were delicious .
their burgers made me real sick once but i got over it .
got the turkey burger , yumm !
then refills of said beer are only _ num _ !
most of the time its pretty relaxed and quiet .
first of all , i already mentioned their beer on tap .
i had their turkey burger while my friends had the regular cheeseburgers .
we basically scarfed down our meals including the yummy fries .
if you 're visiting u of i , definitely hit up this place !
a campus tradition , with all kinds of stuff carved into the booths .
i was in champaign last week , on a wednesday evening .
murphy 's was the only place with their kitchen open after 10 pm .
i ordered a mega bacon cheeseburger and fries .
service here was terrible .
nevertheless , i was okay with my fish sandwich .
what i was served was a ridiculously gross , flavorless hockey puck .
irish nachos come in huge servings .
the first rating was over-generous .
1st example 2nd example crowded for unofficial so i 'm sure they are stressed .
he was pissed .
my bartender was helpful and super nice !
used to go before we hit the club .
i remembered thursday is like an unofficial international day .
food was cold .
almost broke a tooth on a french fry .
place was dirty .
date of original review : 09/11/2014 * based off of visits from august _ num _ - may _ num _ the food and drink selections are great and fairly priced .
the female bartender that took our lunch order had zero personality .
dropped in on a saturday afternoon and the place was empty .
we looked at the menu and standard bar food nothing different than others .
most likely a lively place later and could be decent to hang .
just did not work this time .
it was almost _ num _ in the afternoon and i sat at a pub table .
my sleeve got stuck to the table .
a voice came from behind the bar that said .
i got up and grabbed a couple menu 's .
looked it over and said .
good beer selection for campus town and reasonably priced .
lots of vandalized light wood .
i was stunned .
we waited an unusually long time for two burgers .
eh , this place was alright .
these were a rendition of the cheese curd but a very sub par one .
next off , i had the burger .
i ordered the mushroom burger which was the tuesday special .
the fries were mediocre at best .
i was here on business and decided to stop in for a drink .
a few people in the group ordered food and said it was n't bad .
from seeing the burgers , they looked pretty decent actually .
the process of ordering food was interesting .
always had a great time .
the only thing i was n't too happy about was the service .
it was quite slow .
it seemed like they were a little understaffed .
bar tenders were super cool and friendly .
awesome service and good prices for whatever domestics were on tap .
for two days i wondered how i burned my mouth .
plus the bartender was friendly and the specials were pretty good .
did they read reviews and decide to show up ?
i had the gypsy skillet and i thought it was dry .
the flavor was good for the most part .
the onions were overwhelming and there were too many potatoes and not enough mushrooms .
i also asked for my eggs to not be runny and they were .
i only gave them two stars because that is what i truly feel .
i might change my mind when and if i go back again .
we were super hungry initially , but omg were we stuffed afterwards !
which was so great !
they had a wide variety of dishes , and many healthy options .
my only complaint was the `` fresh squeezed '' orange juice .
i have to say , i was pleasantly surprised by le peep 's brunch . )
, and i was really happy with my granola blueberry pancakes .
he was n't so friendly and he cut us off while talking .
today i went and got their seafood crepes for $ _ num _ .
i used to frequent le peep .
that was so generous of her .
i answered no .
she asked the same question to the lady behind me that paid .
this breakfast spot had big shoes to fill .
the le peep up near northwestern was one of my favorites .
i went for the irish benedict and a cafe mocha .
i had the ham melt without mushroom and tomato .
my husband got the denver skillet ( $ _ num _ ) .
i tried the potatoes in it and they were good .
i had the raz ma taz smoothie and it was great .
we had a coupon so it was worth the visit .
breakfasted at lepeep on saturday .
service was good .
the pancake special sounded delicious : bacon and pecan .
ordered one .
it was okay .
as i said , food was mediocre .
visited le peep yesterday ( 5/2/2012 ) .
both i and my guest experienced marvelous food .
pictures of both were taken and uploaded .
hers looked fantastic .
my omelette was excellent .
melty cheese that was great .
and the ham was great .
we were treated like royalty .
i took my best buddy here for breakfast today .
i figured i 'd give the chambana le peep a whirl .
i ordered the `` wheat '' pancakes .
our food came rather quickly for a sunday morning .
they were in fact regular old un-nutritious pancakes with wheat germ delicately sprinkled atop .
the potatoes were okay .
my friend said her meal was alright .
the waitress was nice and attentive .
she made sure our drinks were never empty and she was pleasant .
would i return ?
had the seafarer !
breakfast , an omelet , was very average and the service was fair .
there was a _ num _ min wait which in my opinion was not bad .
everything sounded tasty .
it did n't disappoint .
upon delivery it was piping hot and visually pleasant .
each bite was good mmmm good .
the menu was extensive but what i ordered was nothing special .
had breakfast here today and the food was delicious .
i had french toast and it was very tasty .
the bathrooms were very clean .
ordered the fruit cakes & they were totally uninspired .
wish i had found this place sooner .
service was a tad slow .
i was with four others , and we all ordered something different .
yum but it was _ num _ % potatoes .
coworker had something hollandaise and said it was average .
flavored coffee was awesome .
the french toast was above average .
also tried the garden omelette which was very light and also delicious .
service was excellent , and prices were also very good .
hearing only good things about this place , i had relatively high expectations .
i first ordered a strawberry creme smoothie .
it came in a chilled glass mug .
upon first sip , i could taste the strawberries .
the food was served within 10-15 minutes .
and dear god , did the combination of both hit the spot !
the waiter/waitresses were very attentive .
they messed it up .
when a younger man , i did n't care for le peep .
well , some _ num _ years later i tried le peep again .
so on saturday i ordered the la petit french toast .
this was more like ` heated bread ' .
these reminded me of pancakes at ihop : bland tasting black holes for syrup .
another reviewer said lp is like pancake house only more expensive .
and such thing happened for two times already !
i had no idea gravy could be that good .
always had eggs benedict .
sometimes i was craving for their french toast originally i would have given this place _ num _ or _ num _ stars .
i asked if i could have a side salad with extra veggies .
i was told no to every possibility i came up with .
the server seemed annoyed and did n't assist me with any other options .
i ended up with _ num _ eggs and a bowl of plain oatmeal .
got the down home county pie more like down home delicious brunch !
i would recommend this place .
my spinnaker omelet was good , just met expectations .
huevos rancheros were a scramble , not the usual presentation of eggs easy over .
my daughter in law said its really just a fancy denny 's .
service was fast .
i ordered the eggs benedict , and was not at all disappointed .
there was even hot sauce already on the table !
the berry compote was nice and the sour cream was a fun touch .
would i go again ?
the food was edible , and the restaurant was clean and bright .
came with a group of _ num _ with no reservation .
it was busy but we were seated within _ num _ minutes .
i went with the stuffed french toast .
the eggs were good and the fruit was fresh .
only checkout was that check out was a bit chaotic .
pecan coffee was a nice added touch .
sir benedict omelet was delicious .
the shamrock eggs benedict was a 10/10 .
the potatoes were n't bad , despite being a little overcooked and salty .
this time i had the raspberry flavour .
it was amazing .
only issue i had was no bike parking .
so , i went to their website and selected two options .
we arrived around _ num _ on friday and were quickly seated .
but , then came a surprise .
the items mentioned on website were not their on menu .
my anxiety level was high , as i hate when my plan fails .
i loved both .
all of them were great le peep is one of the best forgotten restaurants in champaign .
our waitress molly was especially so .
i got the banana walnut pancakes with a side of links and eggs .
we tried omelette , egg benedict and pasta .
tasted like canned .
i ordered the linguine with white clam sauce .
food was overpriced and not that great .
slow service would n't even refill my drink .
bread served with oil and parmesan cheese .
went here with my girlfriend .
we both agreed it was good not great .
it was n't horrible but it was definitely forgettable .
i thought the prices were high for the food quality .
the tomato gravy was okay .
it would be good on pizza .
( i had the baked lasagna . )
when we arrived it was n't busy , but the service was sub par .
then the restaurant filled up and the service was non-existent .
for an app we had fried ravioli .
which was ok .
had lunch there on a rainy day .
the light was dark so i did not enjoy eating there .
the food was just so-so .
we had to ask for water , which did n't come until much later .
we finally asked for and were given exactly one slice of bread each .
um , why would that be , exactly ?
but , ok , message loudly and clearly received .
i picked the spaghettini and added meatballs .
they were t exactly busy but , ok , whatever .
my daughter-in-law had asked for alfredo sauce to be substituted on her pasta dish .
then , i looked at the bill .
loved the minestrone soup .
friendly atmosphere and waitresses was cute as a button .
nice relaxed menswear store .
i had a short-notice interview and i needed a suit that day .
i 'd always noticed this place downtown , so i stopped in .
the salesman was really great .
he even set me up with an appointment to get the suit altered .
yesterday i bought two stupendous greeting cards just because i liked them .
i really kind of liked this little store .
nicely organized .
did n't feel too cramped like some stores .
i had a lovely time browsing & found some beautiful jewellery .
priced competitively with other major chains .
highly recommended !
i came here from another oil change place that i was n't happy with .
they were nice and honest to me .
i had a very pleasant experience .
and the oil change literally took _ num _ min .
really took 10-20 min for full fluid change for nice price .
i went here based on the good reviews and was not disappointed !
i stopped going to jiffylube because of this .
yah , ya got ta love it .
too bad you missed it .
closed sunday and tuesday .
i never saw any of the arrangements i 've ordered .
do n't bother the nice man that now has the number ; ) went in at midnight on a saturday , and the place was mostly empty .
it was disgusting .
needless to say , we warned the next people who attempted to sit there .
the staff kept me updated every step of the way .
i was wrong they are awesome .
friendly service worked hard to make things write on my crashed van .
it did take them awhile to get it fixed .
several days in a row i got phone calls indicating `` probably tomorrow . ''
i would go there again .
dear franchisee , where the hell was the mayo or ketchup or water-laden lettuce and tomato ?
they told me they were out of chicken tenders ( ? )
yesterday , boyfriend and friends wanted hardee 's .
i asked for ranch dressing .
the drive through wait was longer than i had expected but not the worst .
she said she was just checking to be sure they were there .
clearly the person lied about putting it in the bag .
restaurant review it was effortless to order because there was no line .
this made me nervous with how dirty the restaurant was ... overall the booth 's were simply sticky .
the fries were fresh though .
overall this was my first and last experience with hardee 's .
pro : angus thick burger , a step above mcd but still not restaurant quality cons : dirty store ( bugs , a room that was flooded ... ) hidden gem : _ num _ .
the worst i never had a problem with this in the past .
if they had run out would n't just put a sign up ?
nelson , was that the hardee 's on bradley ?
we had some bad cleanliness issues there years ago .
but i went in .
the shop was clean & the staff were polite but not overly so .
it would n't be described as `` posh '' or `` immaculate . ''
and there was a definite difference in how much liquor each bartender put in .
in my opinion , both were pretty weak pours .
anyway , they asked me questions about my day , then performed it back .
i came of age here in many ways .
i even had a bartender recognize me and say hi outside of the bar .
very laid back and chilled for the most part .
i got there late and there was no seating .
i liked that there was no cover charge .
last time i ordered a glass of w.l .
if you are looking for more commonplace ingredients , i would look elsewhere .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
i finally had them just turn it off .
okay , so i went back to give this place a second chance .
one of my favorite nail salons in town , and newly remodeled .
i had a fill done here the other day .
the tech asked me if i wanted square or round .
my first experience here was excellent .
it was in the fall of _ num _ when i learned i was pregnant .
the third time i went there i had a male tech .
i chose a vanilla colored nail polish and he said the same thing .
i told him i like light colors .
i thought it was sarcasm so i smiled back and just nodded my head .
while u was watching her , i counted way too many health code violations !
then he used tweezers that that had not been cleaned .
he cut my cuticles so low they started bleeding .
if i could give this less stars i would .
my friends and i went here for a pedicure .
she was very sweet and talkative .
i was absolutely astonished .
would never recommend to anyone else .
very nice and relaxed off campus bar .
none of that rushed , overzealous high school service .
also , better priced at app .
the owner was irritated as promised in other yelp reviews .
the dining area was cramped and uninviting .
like the tofu soup and kimchi fried rice here !
fried rice is wrapped in omelet egg .
donot come here in uiuc !
restaurant review my first venture into korean food in champaign was good .
it was easy to order because we were the first customers of the day .
i selected the combo platter of bulgogi which was _ num _ .
pro : average price korean food , large portion cons : long cook time , higher price than average lunch places hidden gem : your meal comes with rice , soup , and _ num _ korean ban chae self service for cost effective .
bibimbap sauce literally redeemed my meal .
but overall , would not recommend to eat with families or close friends .
had to share an actual picture of the deliciousness this time .
our waiter brought us out chips and salsa with two cups of salsa .
then we ordered guacamole , which he did n't bring us .
i ordered a steak quesadilla and it was huge and awesome .
my husband got something called the chevy spread ?
i was craving mexican food .
i ordered the flautas , my usual .
i ordered flautas , not a bloody fruit salad .
i wanted sour cream !
pico de gallo and shredded lettuce !
i would love to buy a tub of that salsa .
you could not pay me $ _ num _ to eat the food i ordered again .
we were starving .
neither of us had eaten all day .
the first thing we did was order the nachos .
there was * maybe * _ num _ ounces of cheese on my chips .
the entire plate of nachos probably cost them $ _ num _ .
we did not finish them .
lucky us , or so we thought .
the beef in my tacos was ground fine .
the beans were the texture of a watery soup .
the chicken taco was edible .
i ate it at least .
i was starving though .
again , we had n't eaten all day .
i did n't touch the nacho cheese coated burritos .
i tried the chimichanga last .
i had two bites .
the rice was the best thing on the plate .
the service was as good as it possibly could have been .
you could tell the servers did not like working there .
our server did n't bring us the check .
he had the busser/dishwasher bring us the check .
honestly , we felt sorry for him .
one time i had a waiter bring more corn cake then entree .
i told him i loved him and left a hefty tip .
ooh , i just remembered something i get .
the tacos were great .
with limited options in campaign this weekend , i suggested chevy 's .
also , the service was mediocre .
she was n't even bad , she just lacked a personality .
bummer chevy 's ... i wanted to like you .
the chips had no salt and the salsa tasted like ketchup .
it looked like baby food and did not hold together at all .
but the food was beyond repulsive .
they followed me here ? )
we saw that on fridays they have a $ _ num _ frozen strawberry margarita special .
that deal was calling our name , so we each got one .
the chips and salsa , however , were totally blargh !
they were n't even worth eating .
also , the bartender was visibly perturbed when we asked for the check .
closed .
i would n't be surprised if it were worth trying .
this place existed before campus got swanked up over the last number of years .
crispy , not too heavily battered , not too greasy .
but my all time favorite is the legends ranch chicken served only on mondays .
i had a delicious chicken wrap with french fries .
i liked the all-wood interior , gave the place a nice feel to it .
wait staff and bartenders were always nice .
we were a bit disappointed to see bags of chips .
if only they would stop repainting the exterior wackier and wackier every _ num _ years ... legendarily lame .
we also really enjoyed the outdoor seating area out back .
but straying from those favorites might make you wish you had n't .
i used to like this bar when i was in college , on occasion .
i definitely had some good times there , and the outdoor area was nice .
you did n't realize this is an illini bar ?
how could you not tell from the blue and traffic cone orange facade ?
i did n't have food or alcohol so i can not comment on those .
come here thursday 's for `` logo night . ''
i was not disappointed .
they came back from the bar after another 20 + minutes without drinks .
another bonus was that the bartender serving me was very cute .
and the student newspaper voted them for best service !
i did n't think it was sleazy .
the bun , beef , and topping could all bring more to the table .
would definitely go again .
looks like a fun bar at night too you really had to twist your head around or rearrange the 50 lb barstools .
they misspelled my name on the ride the rail name list on their wall .
there were only _ num _ bartenders working and the line was very long .
moreover , the bartender got me the wrong beer !
my favorite campus bar , how many grilled chicken sandwiches have i enjoyed here ?
could lunch get any more divine ?
had a fish sandwich on friday and it was quite good .
casual atmosphere and we went early to avoid the late night bar crowd .
he made a substitute drink but it was just awful .
no hassles from the locals , though , which was nice .
in fact , everyone there seemed to be having a chill but fun time .
i ordered the fish sandwich with onion rings and it was so good .
and money wise , it was definitely worth it .
the salsa also had a nice kick too , very delicious .
the service was great too .
the food was pretty decent .
i had a ham and swiss sandwich with guinness mustard on a pretzel bun .
the most disgusting food i have ever been ` served ' in my life .
the fries were cold and the service was less than desirable .
i gave it _ num _ [ $ ] just because it so overpriced .
this however was the worst food i have ever had at any location .
the chicken was so dry and cheese sauce was hard and tasted disgusting .
the philly cheesesteak and burger we had for lunch were very good .
the service was great , waitress was very attentive .
there was only one negative while we were there .
there was a university of illinois football game on .
i nearly walked past the hostess booth i just wanted a beer and the service was horrible .
i got one beer and could n't get the bartender to come back .
btw-for a college town , the girls were n't good looking at all .
maybe because it was monday night and the c team was working .
wings and buffalo shrimp were great .
fried pickles were cooked just right .
service was above average but it was a very slow night .
as always , hooters did n't disappoint .
this place was bad i came in hooters because of course i love it this is a tester store so they try new menus but here is the weird part i 'm _ num _ % puerto rican a well respected one because there was plenty of seats waitresses were great !
waitress came around offering a free margarita to critique the bartender .
walked out after sitting for _ num _ minutes - no service .
the food was great , as usual .
this happened at 8:30 pm .
we were really shocked by looking at the whole experience .
our waitress last time was especially wonderful !
she smiled and engaged us all the way through our meal .
we really appreciated her .
this was a great massage !
i would definitely recommend it , especially because the prices are awesome .
my husband got me a gift certificate for a one-hour massage with glenn .
that was , hands down , the best hour massage i have ever gotten .
both of us were so relaxed and just felt great after .
i loved this no-frills , just-massage approach .
it was my first time there , but not in the building itself .
glenn made me feel comfortable and then gave me an excellent first massage experience .
i came away feeling great , relaxed and renewed .
i 'll be back and would gladly recommend him to friends .
the meal ended with fortune cookies and a plate of succulent oranges .
the service was great and the prices were n't bad either .
i found myself @ peking garden celebrating a friends ' completion of his prelims .
i was horrified and delighted simultaneously .
that was my fault for ordering it , not theirs for making it .
i sampled everyone else 's dishes however , and they were quite tasty .
except the second time -- my fortune was blank .
i had my hopes high ... i took a few bites and threw the rest in the trash ( ... i ca n't believe i 'm confessing to this !
that , and the appetizers were very yummy .
luckily i was able to find one on campusfood.com .
i ordered chicken and broccoli and the portions were huge .
fried rice - fairly standard , right ?
there was nothing in it .
it smelled like cardboard and had no discernible flavor .
just rice doused with soy sauce .
the chicken did not taste like general tso .
it was not spicy .
it was not flavorful .
average fast food chinese served by friendly people .
peking garden was a weird case for me though .
at the time , i would have almost gave it a _ num _ star rating .
i was glad i did n't though .
my entree was great but the soup and egg roll tasted weird .
the service was also bad this trip .
the worst part was that me and my girlfriend got food sickness from it ... it was not fun especially since we both had to work later that day .
i was n't familiar with basil chicken .
so i asked the young lady at the counter what was in it .
she informed me that it was carrots , onions , chicken and sauce .
( i asked because i do not like green peppers or mushrooms . )
it did n't even contain carrots or onions .
since it was their mistake i figured they would make it right .
i called to complain .
she replied , `` i do n't care ! ''
and hung up on me .
i literally would eat it everyday if i had a heart of steel .
forgot to write a review last week .
a friend treated me to dinner here .
it was clean and quiet and the service was prompt and courteous .
the egg rolls were good .
my entree was delicious and plentiful .
again , the house tea was good .
loved their home style tofu and egg plant .
atmosphere was nice .
the owner was very friendly .
also good won ton soup .
the shrimp fried rice is delish !
- the little donuts were super yummy , though standard .
i tried the mandarin beef , mongolian beef and potstickers .
the cashier was also friendly and remembered what i ordered right away .
there were a couple other orders ready when i went .
ordered for delivery _ num _ min before close food came quick food good listened to special requests recommended so , the next best option was to get delivery .
the child screamed .
the man yelled back and then hit him again .
got take out on a monday night .
i used the online ordering which was convenient and easy .
we got a chicken lo mein combo and an empress chicken .
the chicken lo mein was good .
portion size including the rice was huge .
the egg rolls that game with it were average .
my empress chicken was alright .
it tasted like every other sweet and sour sauce .
the chicken also seemed to be a little soft and mushy .
our meal cost $ _ num _ .
i unfortunately was just not very impressed with my empress chicken .
the dumplings were huge and homemade .
dinner for _ num _ with drinks and appetizers came to almost exactly $ _ num _ .
i thought it was a great value .
it was n't the newest .
it was n't the flashiest .
but it was one of the best chinese meals i 've had in years .
i never would have guessed since this place looks pretty average .
i came here 1-2 times a week for a semester .
probably not the healthiest option , but it was one of the most delicious !
he smiled and started making my dog .
both he and the woman working there at the time were very polite .
the dog itself was pretty good .
i had a very average experience here .
i loved dandelion when i lived in champaign .
i went with selling the clothes in favor of the concert .
`` used . ''
i just did n't find it that great .
i would like to see them get more variety of jewelry , however .
i came here with a friend this summer .
we had a blast !
i was certain i would never have shoes like these again .
when i found them here , and in my size !
it was the greatest day !
my fiance got some amazing pants there .
i did n't find anything , but even in la that 's not unusual .
mens items were very clear .
the woman working the register was friendly and helpful .
i was in chambana and i needed new shoes .
i saw this place and i figured -- why not ?
never had a bad time at the tumble inn .
i spent many , many nights here and always had fun .
loved the genuine neighborhood feel and the old busch stadium seats at the tables .
the service was wonderful and the older decor brought a smile !
needless to say i was none too happy and gave up .
i used to love bob evans .
we had pork roast with mashed potatoes and carrots .
anyhoo , they made us feel welcome after a long road trip .
the food was excellent , i had the breakfast .
our waitress could not have been less thrilled to serve us .
the food was decent .
we had french toast and an omelet .
both satisfied the breakfast craving .
service was good and fast .
took about 15-20 minutes to get a table , but the service was good .
i had the potato encrusted pollack with green beans & baked potato .
my daughter had the pancakes with link sausage .
our last visit to bob evans was only ok .
this bob evans was like the others .
good when needing something familiar : - ) decided to try lunch to go today .
i ordered the ham & swiss grilled on sourdough and vegetable soup .
i liked the bread and the swiss cheese .
the vegetable soup was ok but it had a lot of corn in it .
the people working at the counter were very nice and the service was speedy .
however , the second time i went here , it was for breakfast .
service was ok , attentive and friendly .
staff was mostly friendly and courteous .
food was not so good .
they ran out of pico-de-gallo for nachos at noon !
the eggs and biscuits were nice but not as good as other places .
boy oh boy did that joy end quickly !
ordered a full order of biscuits & gravy , the meal came fairly quickly .
it was hot as well .
my 1st indication of an issue were the hard ass biscuits he brought me .
i was completely grossed out !
then my apple juice had something floating in it .
gravy was good & workers were nice .
who would 've thought i 'd be reviewing a library ?
he could n't believe the changes .
now if only i could get a library card !
shelves and shelves of books , organized so intuitively and neatly .
what more could i want ?
i thought that was the point of a library ?
i explained to them that due to a condition i could not sit differently .
they again asked me to move .
every single item on the list was checked to be cleaned .
i was even charged a fee to clean those off .
and you should n't either ... i was happy enough with my apartment with barr .
i would have cleaned it had i known i was supposed to .
i felt like i had no privacy at all .
this lasted at least _ num _ months .
authuser = 0 & feat = directlink pictures i took after cleaning : https : / / picasaweb.google.com/110253500433385469135/510smattisapt107moveoutpictures ?
took _ num _ cats there .
been happy with dr. mcelroy .
he explained everything in detail and always asked for my approval before doing anything .
the staff was great and dr. dust was wonderful .
i liked that the waiting areas for dogs and cats were separated too .
she listened to my concerns and was incredibly receptive to my thoughts and opinions .
he said it was nothing to worry about .
i felt so much better .
took them to vca and all it was was a bladder infection !
: ) my cat received great care from dr. mcelroy at vca .
his backside was very red , swollen , and tender .
he also had an infection in his ear that she prescribed an ointment for .
the veterinarian was wonderful !
i was very happy with the staff .
vca was great through the whole process .
costs were reasonable .
i had the very same experience as sarah .
he had nail polish all over his hands and my toes .
i literally started laughing because it was so absurdly bad .
the whole experience was rushed , which made me feel very uncomfortable .
i was looking forward to a relaxing experience & it did not happen .
this lady ( the owner ) had an overall rough touch .
my wife and i been here several times and were very happy every time .
maybe they got new staff in the _ num _ years since the last review ?
easy access to drinking with the bar wrapped around the `` center '' wall .
the drinks on hand were pretty cool .
never was disappointed once .
we found great seats up in balcony , which had it 's own bar .
were the bar stools and benches comfortable ?
all towns would be so lucky to have a music venue like the highdive .
would never recommend to anyone .
the bouncer was very casual and stamped your hand if you were underage .
he filled my water three times and i was very grateful .
when the band played , my friend and i stood in the middle .
the high dive would be a great experience if you were into the band .
i was here a few weeks ago for the claw event .
it was amazing !
great night , music was really good .
anyone could have taken it !
the sound was nearly perfect .
i would love to come back .
the first time i went there i was astounded by how huge it was .
and they were only $ _ num _ each .
so they definitely had a nice children 's section .
i could spend months in this store .
if only i had more time today .
i told her that i was looking to get my son some p.j .
's , and with that she said `` oh ... carry on ! ''
i was like , wtf !
she then said with a huff , `` fine !
`` , and mumbled something under breath .
i used to go to wet seal , forever _ num _ .
my daughter wanted her hair done so they started to curl it .
kind of awkward walking around the mall with half of your hair curled .
but did purchase some cheap _ num _ scarves last winter .
two people sitting at front desks looked almost surprised that a customer walked in .
i called over looking for a magnepull .
they said they had one and then quoted me a price .
i thanked them for checking .
the guy said they did n't sell anything like that .
i forgot how bad they.are .
we bought a sleep number mattress in this store in january .
the warranty - we were told sure no problem !
i ordered my bed on 8/31 during the labor day sale .
the people at the chandler store were very nice .
they said that the bed would take 2-3 weeks for delivery .
this required me to take a day off from work to receive the bed .
not sure if ready to buy but wanted to explore the product !
the store was `` white-glove '' clean and the atmosphere felt warm and inviting !
was asked my preference of pillow ( i am a soft ! )
: ) he offered to see what we could get out by buffing the scratch .
the minute i pulled in mr. ivey was there to help me .
he would n't even let me do that .
he just asked i remember him if i got in an accident .
i would definitely take my car there again .
doug was very friendly and professional .
our car got hit and needed a paint job on the front bumper .
two cars damaged within a week due to winter weather .
highly recommended .
had my entire bumper replaced after a winter collision .
best price i found in champaign area .
car was finished the day after i dropped it off nice hotel .
bed was comfy .
would stay again .
we spent one night at the la quinta inn in champaign while attending ebertfest .
handicapped-accessible primarily meant a larger bathroom/bathtub , which is always a good thing .
stayed just for a day while visiting friends in urbana .
carpet seemed very new and clean .
breakfast was good .
coffee was very good .
i was not satisfied with my stay .
clean , nicely decorated , close to the highway .
this recently remodeled hotel was perfect for our two night stay for a wedding .
the rooms were clean and nicely decorated .
the main lobby was very nice !
i took it back to my room .
the pool looked nice , we ran out of time to use it .
i would definitely stay there again !
- the staff was all friendly .
- the bed was comfortable , and the room was clean .
since i do n't eat wheat , i did n't have anything .
it was move in day for my daughter at uiuc college .
i was pleasantly surprised .
it was very clean , beds comfortable , breakfast was very nice .
the bathrooms were a bit small but overall the room was very comfortable .
i would stay here again without hesitation .
the staff was friendly .
the room was comfortable .
we were very happy with our stay .
the staff was friendly and helpful .
our room was spacious , clean , and smelled fresh .
the bed was so comfortable .
it had a cheap feel to it .
there was a time _ num _ years ago when la quinta was a quality brand .
the front deck clerk was somewhat arrogant and the breakfast was chintzy .
what really irritated me was the pricing .
i would like to liken this to extortion .
we arrived to find our room exactly as we expected .
it was comfortable , quiet and in an excellent location .
they welcomed our small dog with a doggie biscuit as well .
the room was less than $ 70/night , and it was a steal .
when we got to our king suite , i was pleasantly surprised .
recommended .
i had a very hard time hearing anything my friend said .
we finished our food and got out of there so we could visit .
it took _ num _ minutes for her to come and take our drink order .
and that really made her madder .
both times we also had poor service .
i did not like the pizza .
the waitress seemed to be a little rude .
i really enjoyed my pizza at monical 's .
a schoolmate advised me to ask for their french dressing on my pizza .
it was absurd , of course , but tasted fantastic .
we ordered the stuffed pizza .
it was fabulous !
you got ta try it !
worked at one when i was _ num _ lol .
