morgan _UNK in `` bruce almighty '' who does n't want to be god ?
would angels , if they existed , possess free will ?
and if so , what was the point of god creating mankind ?
i believe angels exist .
i also believe they have free will .
in isaiah the prophet says that the greatest of the angels was lucifer and he _UNK to god 's throne .
he said he would make himself like the almighty .
ok , this is open rebellion .
and a third of the angels in heaven followed him !
you 've got to wonder what the problem was with a third of the angels that they would rather follow lucifer than the lord .
and it says that war was in heaven and lucifer and the angels that followed him were cast out of heaven .
sounds like a lot of free will to me .

how does _UNK sexual violence and crime affect our society ?
there is n't really hard evidence to suggest that it does affect our society in any tangible sense .
there are studies which show that children who watch violent tv programs tend to show higher rates of violent behavior soon afterwards .

additionally , i 'm not aware of any similar studies involving adults .
it 's been _UNK that it could _UNK us to violence , thus making us more accepting of it .
but , the opposite could also be true .
good question , but i 'm afraid the jury 's still out on that .
would anyone be offended if i said i did n't believe zeus existed ?

why does bad sh*t happen for no reason ? ''
does anyone find that offensive ?
zeus , maybe .

its total bs .

christians believe in a god , so that makes them the opposite of an atheist .

a lot f guys present girls like trophies , and wear them like a fancy _UNK - for show .
whoever has the prettiest girl , wins .

in terms of doctrine or things that actually matter like how often you need to go to church , christmas , and etc .
essentially anything that would affect family life .
between the eastern orthodox and the roman catholics ?
is n't one of the main differences that most roman catholic priests are not married and most eastern orthodox priests are permitted to marry ?
-- i think that `` would affect family life '' .
another difference ... roman catholics acknowledge the _UNK of the roman _UNK ; eastern orthodox do not .
similarities include , i think , that they all believe in _UNK .

i am half black and filipino .
it seems that my filipino family members believe my mix is not as beautiful as a white and filipino mix .
can anyone relate to this ?
sadly , especially in my family , i find that my older filipino family members are prejudiced against black people or other _UNK or filipino people .
i do n't know the logic behind it .
maybe it was the way they were brought up , a lack of understanding and tolerance .
do n't despair .
keep in mind that it is n't you that is the problem .
it 's their ignorance that causes you to get that vibe from them .
nothing you can do about it .
it wo n't change their minds .

science & religion ( not vs ) ?
can they ever _UNK ?
the only differences is that religion has god ( s ) and science has the big band theory .
one has religious morals and the other uses human rational .
one believes in a `` higher power '' , the other believes that everthing is connected through organic means .
do n't they both in a way make sense if you looked at their ultimate purpose .
that being , understanding the world in which we live .
therefore theoretically could they not exist under the same roof ?
if not then ( again , theoretically ) what would we have to do in order to balance the scales to make them one .
yes , but both sides have to open their minds , however most _UNK % of christians and _UNK dont have open minds .
so unless they are willing to let their guard down , it will never happen

she knew that after his death , romans took the cross and threw it to the garbage .
she went there and tried to find the place that they threw it .
she told the workers to search there .
and she found it .
they understood that it was the holy cross because they touched a woman that just died that time and she aroused .
i think that the biggest part of the cross is in mount _UNK in greece .
we celebrate in orthodox christianity this event on may 21st .

will divorce rates lessen or increase over time ?
no , because it lost that years ago .

if we get four marriages than what would happen ?

if you elaborate on the meaning of the word , it might be clearer .

in short - you are worried about your brothers ( obvious really ) .

when people say `` do n't work too hard '' what does it really mean ?
i teach english as a second language .
i have done so for years and in several countries .
i dont think that we should pick these words apart to decide what it means .
look at the situations that native speakers use phrase .
what are they 're feelings when they say it .
in my experience people say this to people they care about .
they want this person to be happy and enjoy their life .
maybe they feel they work too much .
or , it is often the case that they want that person to go out that day .
when the reply is , `` i cant , im busy '' one often hears , `` you work too hard '' .
but really , it is mostly said as a _UNK line ... _UNK way to say goodbye .
like take it easy

and as christians , we hope for a christian leader .
but we must not be blind to the possibility that a politician would _UNK `` court '' the christian vote when it is their only way to get elected .
how would one go about proving that their religion is the `` right '' one ?
is there some sort of empirical evidence that proves one over another ?
most problems in this world are created by people who want to prove that their religion or their country or their economic ideology is better than others .
religion is not about 'my dad can beat up your dad ! '
it is quite opposite .
those who want to prove that their religion is superior do n't know the first thing about religion .
organized religions should try to be servants of humanity , not masters .

such _UNK ... ... ... _UNK and eve , sex is sin etc ... so _UNK .
birds and bees do it .
in _UNK , sex is necessary .
it is the same book that said `` ... .go forth and multiply ... ... ... '' .
contradiction in terms .
there are no adams , no _UNK , no hell , no heaven .
just a bunch of _UNK .
it all just evolved .
science proves it .
you prove adam and eve existed .
it 's a belief .
let 's keep it that way .

what prohibits human men from evolving ?
: } people change over time based on nutrition even environment .
the theory of evolution depends on a concept called _UNK of the _UNK .
that theory works as far as our gene pool will allow it to .
there are millions of possible combinations within our gene pool ; at any given time those genes which best allow individuals to survive and prosper will emerge .
but that is change within our genetic structure not evolution .
the reason men do not evolve is that we can not create new dna or new and different genes and they do not occur by chance .
is valentine 's day just a bunch of bull from corporate america ?

feng shui -- live creek or stream in the backyard , good or bad ?
the house rear property is approximately 6-8 feet elevated above the _UNK creek .
deer , birds and small animals drink from it often .
we have a bench _UNK the creek .
note : the creek ( 4-5 feet wide ) works as a buffer zone from the neighbor behind us .
i 'd appreciate any feedback fellow _UNK .
i have read that it is _UNK to have water ponds and _UNK streams in the front of the home to collect beneficial chi .
i know this may not be feasible for you , but i have read this from more than one source on feng shui .
this is even more apparent to me because we have a pond in the backyard with a small circulating _UNK .
to me , it is a bit too close to the house and causes a bit of insecure feelings to build up .
other than that , is is sometimes a very beautiful pond to see .
good luck fellow feng shui _UNK !

as for religion , it does n't matter who you worship .
it all equals out to the same ... .the creator of the earth .
god , allah , and so on .
it 's a damn shame too .
peace to you .

will my relatives like these thanksgiving gifts ?
i 'm 28 years old and i have very low income .
are these gifts ok ?
i was n't aware that you needed to buy thanksgiving presents .
think about the holiday .
it 's about giving thanks for what we have , not expecting or wanting more .
those are nice things because you thought about them , but save them for a month , then give them .
a card with a loving statement about the receiver should be more than enough .

_UNK is based upon the teachings of _UNK , who lived _UNK years ago .
buddhist and _UNK religions have their roots in his doctrine .
should men offer their seat on a _UNK to a woman , regardless of her age ?
any thoughts ?
what a great question !
are there any cultures which associate the 'good ' afterlife with _UNK ' and the 'bad ' afterlife with _UNK ' ?
since ancient greek times we in the west ( and many in the middle east ) have identified _UNK ' with heaven and _UNK ' with hell .
is this a universal among those who believe in an _UNK afterlife ( excluding those who believe in _UNK reincarnation ) ?
i think most _UNK religions tend to believe that 'good ' spirits walk among us here on _UNK , so there 's no real sense of _UNK ' there .
but i like your question .
it 's an interesting one .
a lot of religious concepts and practices pass from one religion to another , so there should be nothing surprising about general _UNK ' like that .

a game for _UNK youth group ?
do you know of a good indoor game for youth group ?
jr high kids with lots of energy , so please no thinking games or verses .
any help would be great .
thanks here 's a site for some games http : _UNK one of my favorite games i learned in junior high youth group is called shuffle your _UNK .
everyone sits in chairs in a circle with one person standing in the middle .
there is one more chair than the number of people that are sitting down .
the person in the middle tries to sit in that seat and the people in the circle switch chairs to keep that person from getting an open chair .
when that person gets an open chair the person to the right has to go in the middle .
the applications are that we need to keep the devil out of our lives and to turn the other cheek .
ok enough of this polygamy business ?
there is a reason why it was stopped .
most of you have never seen a jewish mother-in-law .
thats bad enough , but two !
a normal man can not handle it .
there is a reason my father told me to marry an orphan .
do you think it was an _UNK that abraham , _UNK , and jacob lived thousands of miles away from there in laws ?
you allow polygamy and the _UNK and mother-in-law murder rate will sky rocket !
your father is a wise man .
or a wise guy , i ca n't decide .
only men , with their infinite _UNK , would think polygamy would be like having a _UNK .
the reality is being _UNK in stereo .
you 've dipped up you thanksgiving plate what was the very first thing you tasted ?
mine was the dressing this will probably sound strange .
since it has been so dry and hot this year , there have been very few home grown tomatoes .
someone gave my mom some beautiful home grown tomatoes .
i took one look at them , and knew they were going to be good .
they were deep red and looked so good , trust me they were .
that was the first thing that i tasted and the best .
what thing poeple fear most in these days ?
what is going on in this world now and what it may lead to if something does n't happen to stop it .
is the person of the master different from his teaching ?
rarely can a teacher live up to the total message they are teaching .

the most important thing is develop your own beliefs .

most _UNK rely on peoples ignorance not their own knowledge of the truth .
while fellowship is important in sharing and _UNK what you believe it is n't where you should get your ideas .
study what you believe and think deeply about it .
never be afraid to question yourself or your beliefs because it leads to understanding .

if i dial police dogs , i can use _UNK ... but that 's getting super obscure .
yeah .
ummmm ... ... what was the question ?
who has created god ?
dont say himself .
this is like asking , `` what does blue smell like ? ''
blue is not in the category of things that have odor , so the question itself is flawed .
in the same way , god is not in the category of things that are created , or come into existence , or are caused .
god is _UNK and _UNK - he simply exists .
how do we know this ?
well , we know that from nothing , nothing comes .
so if there was ever a time when there was absolutely nothing in existence then nothing would have ever come to exist .
but things do exist .
therefore , since there could never have been absolutely nothing , something had to have always been existing .
that _UNK thing is what we call god .

what is your opinion of the south african civil unions bill ?
yes , now gays can register a civil union .
but we still can not get married legally .
is this just a _UNK of apartheid ( separate facilities for some groups ) , or should we accept the legislation ?
i agree with you to a degree .
first of all it is disgusting to me that south africa is so far ahead of the us in gay rights .
i think the state needs to get out of the marriage business .
state sanctioned unions should have always been called something other than marriage .
to me marriage is a religious ritual ... .it is between me , the person i love , our community of faith and our god .
why would the government need to be part of that ?
civil unions grant the legal rights of a marriage and are appropriate for the state to perform .
of course , in reality the state is never going to stop doing straight marriages , so we deserve nothing short of equal treatment .

i am new to this country and i do n't know much about the culture here .
so , u might think this is a stupid question but i really do n't know .
cologne is a _UNK liquid that one applies to his body to make him smell better .
it is common in many european countries .
it originated during the black plague in europe .
they would put cologne and perfume on a _UNK and when they passed a deceased person , they would smell the cologne to cover the other smells nearby .
now , though , culture has transformed it into a symbol of status .
you smell like you are wearing expensive cologne and people treat you better .

i have no answer of my own , i just wonder what people think ?

the more i read , the less i believed it was the right religion or path for me .

how is asking what `` god '' does with his left hand perverted ?
the bible talks about his right hand all the time but never talks about his left hand .
i just wanted to know what it does .
you and i both know the answer to this .
it 's not perverted .
it 's that you 're questioning them about their god in a way they 've never been questioned about before , nor have questioned themselves .
it 's like when i ask them if they thought god watched porn !
the reactions you 're getting are because you 're getting them to think ( and i imagine that hurts them , like sunlight does a vampire ) .
how did slaves respond _UNK way that they were treated ?

okay guys , this is my first question on here .
i 've answered many of your questions , honestly and _UNK , so i would appreciate the same consideration .

many people treat the bible like some mysterious book that no one can really understand .
it is understandable , and it is relevant to us today & very helpful .
so , let 's hear what you think .
no .
that phrase is not in the bible !
in fact , it is _UNK to the main teaching of the bible , that god helps those who are helpless !

in heaven or hell .

hey , i 'm a teen and dont have much of a holiday list ... anyone got any ideas ?
do n't mention new video game systems ... hard to find !
it really depends on the person .
most teenage girls would enjoy makeup of some kind , or some relaxing candles or jewelry , as everyone knows .
adults ( parents ) enjoy it when you make something for them .
it is easy to _UNK , glue , and paint a _UNK .
they sell _UNK in most _UNK stores .
with younger children , male teenagers , and younger teenagers , they appreciate it if you give them something that follows their interests .
or you can craft from clay .
it is easy to buy the kind that _UNK , and then paint it .
i do n't suggest _UNK modeling clay , the kind in the plastic bag packaging .
it tends to be very _UNK , like _UNK play doe ( how do you spell it ? )
good luck on gift hunting !

history channel has a program ( just shown two days ago ) about the rise of christianity in the roman empire .

search `` emperor _UNK '' you should find all you need there .
any catholic site will only give you their `` _UNK '' version of what was happening .
why do people kill each other ?
short answer.. , fear longer answer , it 's in our genetic make-up .
as organisms , we are _UNK to survive and reproduce .

again , to better satisfy the original _UNK of survival and reproduction .
we are organisms that kill out of fear ( culture either _UNK or _UNK this _UNK response )
i 'm afraid of talking before people especially while taking _UNK should get out of my stage fear ?
when you stand in front of the group , make a connection with only one person at a time .
just look at him/her and talk as though he/she were the only one in the room .
then at the next phrase or so , switch to another person , and talk to him/her like you would if you were sitting in your kitchen .
excite them ?
remember that as you make a connection with the audience , one person at a time .
you can also try _UNK , which is a great way to get practice .

i 'd recommend just stopping watching the videos .

the book claims that leonardo da vinci is one of the grand masters of the organization called _UNK of _UNK that protects the _UNK of jesus and mary magdalene .

10 points for the best .
there is only one i hate to call it religion cause its not its the heart .
but i want to hear if people can comprehend it like i do .
love god , love others as you would yourself .
jesus replied that to the religious leaders when they asked what is the greatest command of all .
love does not hurt , mock , gossip , judge , kill , anger or anything that would harm others .
god 's true intention of the law is for us to learn what hurts each other and jesus came to fulfill it and now therefore we are under grace .
if love governs our hearts , we would n't do anything that harm others .
the perspective we should try is the motivation of love and not having the pressure to `` obey the law . ''
love _UNK those `` laws '' god loves us regardless of what we do because he looks at the heart .

i 'm muslim and i 'm very proud that i 'm muslim .and i thank god ever day cause he made me muslim

what paths does god want women to have ?
woman have a higher calling than men , according to jesus , and that is to serve .
we men have been chosen to be the leader -- but that is not the greatest calling .
if you noticed , it was the women who received the greatest honors while jesus was on earth .
look at mary and _UNK jesus ' feet , and how jesus honored that act .
it was the women who first saw the risen lord .
why ?
because they were in the process of serving at the time -- to _UNK the body of the `` dead '' .
when you become a christian , you need to learn to think _UNK .

good luck .

sounds to me like you would rather be queer .
well ... ... homosexual , you are queer .

what does _UNK _UNK mean to you ?
words are vehicles that take you to good things or bad things .

so choose carefully , knowing that both of you will be growing up ... do n't do the sex before marriage thing , please .

for those who believe god is a myth ... ?
is he the most important myth of our time ?
hm - good question .
i think the myth of an optimum _UNK system would probably be a stronger contender ( at least in the developed world ) .
the myth of progress ( ie .
that `` progress '' is always a good thing ) is another likely one .
god was probably the most important myth of previous times , but has n't been for a while .
another good question might be `` when did god cease being the most important myth ? ''
some time between the enlightenment and the french revolution ?
another millennium , if the past one was the last one ?
go figure !

what should i do ?
im so bad at this time of stuff .
honey , your age difference should n't matter -- that is n't much and it sounds like an excuse to me .
i think that is his hint that he 's not interested in you as a sexual partner .
you could remain friends if you can tolerate the situation , but do n't expect more .
look elsewhere for someone who deserves your affection and devotion and returns it in kind .
it 's very difficult trying to find your soul mate and you 've only just begun .
in my experience , it takes gay men alot longer than lesbians to find their lifelong partner .
good luck .

how do i find angular velocity ?
it 's telling em to _UNK find the maximum acceleration .
i found that maximum acceleration is amplitude x omega squared .
so i was wondering how i can find the omega .
they gave me that the frequency is 2.0 x 10 to the 12th hertz and that the amplitude is 1.1 x 10 to the negative 11th meters .
i thought that i could find it by using the inverse of 2 x _UNK .
the angular velocity is given by w = _UNK .
in your case w = _UNK = _UNK * _UNK rad/s hence the max acceleration = _UNK ( _UNK ) ^2 = _UNK m/s

what is the result on the pulse rate whilst standing up ?
from the _UNK ( laying down position ) to the standing positions , there are several changes that occur .
when _UNK , the blood is all at the same level as the heart , and as such , all has the same gravitational potential energy .
this means the heart does n't have to work as hard to pump it .
when someone stands up , the blood `` falls '' down , and _UNK in the aorta ( among other places ) cease to be stimulated .
this means there will be less _UNK of the _UNK ( _UNK _UNK lateral _UNK ) .
this response is _UNK , as once pumping increases , flow is maintained , and the heart rate can return to normal .

why is salt water important for fish ?
a fish adapted to salt water must have a certain concentration of salt in the water because of _UNK pressure .
the cells of a fish do n't have cell walls , just like all animal cells .
if a salt water fish is put into fresh water , too much water will rush into its cells .
as you can imagine , this is not too good for the cell .
some fish are adapted to live in fresh water part of their lives and salt water part of their lives .
i really do n't know how they do that , but then again , i 'm not an _UNK .
do black holes ever `` burn out ?
`` ?
according to stephen _UNK , they do `` burn out '' .
his theory of _UNK radiation suggests that black holes emit energy in the thermal range .
this radiation will continue for billions of years until the black hole literally evaporates .
a black hole with the mass of our sun will take many many many times the age of the current universe ( 14 billion years ) to die out .

what degree has the best job opportunities ?
mechanical engineering tech or electronics engineering tech ?
why ?
be wary of the tech aspect to these degrees they will limit your abilities .
the tech aspect is usually associated with a two year degree and pretty much means that you will be limited to being a technician .
if you are looking for that type of work then the electronics would definitely be the better of the two .
the electronics will open you up to a lot of industries that the can not .
plus the pay will usually be a little bit higher .
i would suggest however going all the way with either of the degrees .
you would still be able to do the tech work if you want but the actual engineering _UNK type work would also then be available .
i am currently an electrical engineer and know quite a few people who have been limited by that tech part of their degree .

what are the differences between colonies of bacteria , yeast and _UNK and how are they different ?
main differences and how are they different to each other .
_UNK and _UNK are fungi - these are _UNK different from bacteria ( about as different as we are from a tree ! )
- if you 're interested check back on what makes different kinds of cell different - eg .
plants have a cell wall and animals do n't .
fungi produce _UNK ( a bit like plant roots ) which search for nutrients - these will make the colony look furry .
it will look like a circle ( or in liquid suspension a sphere ) because cells multiply from the point of infection out .
sometimes they can be blank in the middle where nutrients have run out in the centre so the bacteria there have died ( not moved ! )
that 's the main difference - hope that 's helped a bit !

what does _UNK mean ?
to make a _UNK is a follow the example of bees in taking the shortest route from one place to another .
the expression comes from the belief that bees return to the high by the shortest possible way after they have gathered their food .
and the shortest distance between two points is , of course , a straight line .
but on their return home , the bees sometimes make lines , which are far from straight .
these are dancing movements in the air to inform other members of the colony about their source of supply .
they indicate whether the food is pollen or _UNK , the direction and distance from the hive and even the colors of the flowers .
this bee code was discovered by the german _UNK professor k. von _UNK .
he found , for example , that a circular dance says the food source is close to the hive and that a _UNK dance indicates longer distances .
which of these expresses 3/4 + 4 5/8 as an improper fraction ?

where is gravity stronger , on top of mt .
mc _UNK or at the red sea ?
distance from center of mass , but shape of mass may be misleading some of the answers above are correct but with inaccurate explanations .
away from earth 's surface ( a good approximation is _UNK ) , distance decreases its gravitational pull .
but , under earth 's surface , distance also decreases gravitational pull .
at the center of earth , its gravitational pull is zero or _UNK small .
even at the same elevation , gravity has small variations at different locations .
the variations are small enough for us to detect .
but there exists super sensitive people who can detect those variations .
the safe guess is that mt .
_UNK has lower gravitational pull .
but to be sure , we need to do measurements there and at the red sea .

fish do n't live _UNK long in water that has been boiled and brought back to room temperature .
why do you think this is ?
boiling does not remove anything but gases dissolved in the water .
minerals are actually concentrated by boiling since water is removed , but the dissolved solids remain .
so , the correct answer is that the oxygen is driven off .
oxygen has no significant solubility in water that hot .
if you really need to boil the water to kill bacteria or something , you can _UNK the water with an aquarium air rock designed for this purpose .
it releases _UNK of tiny bubbles into the water .
i 'd suggest running it for a day or two for a 20 gal tank before _UNK the fish .

however , it might be possible .
horses and _UNK are genetically _UNK similar to each other than humans and chimps , but can produce young , occasionally even fertile young .
oh , and different chromosome number does not automatically _UNK breeding .
there are some species of butterfly which are capable of producing fertile offspring between individuals with 20 chromosomes and those with over 60 .
what matters is how similar the chromosomes are .
_UNK had two of their chromosomes fuse not far back in evolutionary history .
you can still see the _UNK ( `` _UNK '' of the chromosomes ) in the middle of the one that resulted from the fusion .
since the structure of the genes on the chromosome has n't _UNK much , we may well still be compatible to some extent .

can the rules of mathematical formulas change ?
basic maths : seems to me to have have one rule for some and others for calculus .
i am shore that you transfer x onto the other side by dividing , or multiplying ( depending ) yet here in _UNK .
they subtract x , does this make logical sense , or do people change the rules , or does things like this work out either way ?
thanks .
the rules of math are always consistent .
i 'm not really sure what you 're asking about x , but different problems are solved in different ways .
in algebra , adding or subtracting x is usually enough to get your solution , while calculus often involves multiplying by x or dividing out powers of x .
more complicated math requires more complicated _UNK , but that does n't mean that the rules of the more basic _UNK have been changed .

what is _UNK strength ?
_UNK strength measures the force required to pull something such as rope , wire , or a structural beam to the point where it breaks .
specifically , the _UNK strength of a material is the maximum amount of _UNK stress that it can be subjected to before failure .
the definition of failure can vary according to material type and design methodology .
this is an important concept in engineering , especially in the fields of material science , mechanical engineering and structural engineering .
there are three typical definitions of _UNK strength : * yield strength - the stress a material can withstand without permanent _UNK .
* ultimate strength - the maximum stress a material can withstand .
* breaking strength - the stress coordinate on the _UNK curve at the point of rupture .

when you push your body to consume extra energy , as by exercising , the fat cells are _UNK and you lose weight .
why is the boiling point of _UNK higher than n ( _UNK ) 3 ?
_UNK has hydrogen bonding at the nitrogen , whereas n ( _UNK ) 3 does not .
since nitrogen is more _UNK than carbon , an nitrogen bonded to a hydrogen is a very polar bond with the positive end of the dipole at the hydrogen .
so the positive hydrogen of one molecule will be attracted to the negative nitrogen of another .
this makes it harder to separate molecules of _UNK into the vapor phase , so the boiling point is higher .
how do you find _UNK water on the periodic table ?
i ca n't find it on an old one .

hence , it 's possible for c to be the midpoint , but it could be elsewhere as well .
what is electric charge ?
i doesnt mean its results .
an electrical charge is an imbalance between an atom 's positive and negative units ( _UNK and electrons ) .
a discharge of electrical energy happens when electrons jump from one atom to on that is differently charged to bring the two atoms closer to a balance .
if an atom has more electrons that protons , it is negatively charged .
if it has more protons than electrons , then it is positively charged .
a charge is always changed by changing the number of electrons .
if you change the number of protons , it becomes a nuclear _UNK since the change is happening in the nucleus of the atom .

: - ) you have zero on top and zero on bottom , so you can certainly go ahead and use _UNK .
derivative of top and bottom .
cos ( x ) -1 becomes ( _UNK ) and x^2 becomes 2x .
now you have _UNK / 2x which you need to evaluate for x- > 0 .
on top you have sin ( 0 ) which is zero , and on bottom 2 ( 0 ) is zero .
you have _UNK again , so _UNK again .
_UNK x becomes _UNK x 2x becomes 2 .
now you get _UNK / 2 , evaluated for zero that 's -1/2 .

how does _UNK force work .
_UNK force any motion in a curved path represents accelerated motion , and requires a force directed toward the center of curvature of the path .
this force is called the centripetal force which means `` center seeking '' force .
the centripetal acceleration can be derived for the case of circular motion since the curved path at any point can be extended to a circle .
if the centripetal force must be provided by friction alone on a curve , an increase in speed could lead to an unexpected _UNK if friction is insufficient .

why are people so susceptible to concepts like religion ?
humans worship their fathers ' fathers ' fathers ' gods .

when we grow up and realize that we do n't have an infinite amount of time of this planet , people turn to what they have been taught .
that there is a better life after death but you have to follow a path to get there .
therefore religion steps in and tries to turn your fear of death to faith instead giving hope .

why ca n't we , the us , start using the metric system ?
every other country in the world is using the metric system .
why ca n't we , the us , start using it and gradually phase out our measuring system ?
the least we could do is to start putting the metric measurements next to our measurements .
money is an issue unless you want to fund the cost for the conversion !
the metric system would n't make any technology better .
engineers and scientists still have to think to get things done correctly .
the metric system certainly has n't helped your ability to spell .

many , many tests were taken on me.. the doctors called me a _UNK .
the doctors said i 'd never have kids but somehow i was given the _UNK of children .
so far in their twenties my kids seem to be alright but put weight on easy .
they have been tested .
i wonder if it is possible for them or their children to have problems down the line .
only 2 % of cases of _UNK hypothyroidism are hereditary , so it is unlikely that your grandchildren will have any problems .
even if they do , _UNK _UNK in the u.s. are tested for this before they leave the hospital -- so it would be discovered right away .
as long as they took their _UNK , they would be normal kids and grow up to be normal adults .

is there a connection between the phases of the moon and earthquakes or _UNK ?
yes , there should be a weak connection between phases of the moon and earthquakes or volcanoes .
both earthquakes and emerging volcanoes depend on growing stress within the earth .
the moon can raise tides both in the crust of the earth and the oceans , affecting weight of water over portions of the earth .
the moon tide can serve as the straw that breaks the camel 's back causing an event to happen slightly sooner than it would anyway .
of course phases of the moon deal with the reflection of the sun 's light relative to the positions of the sun , moon and earth .

what prevents thermal cameras from detecting temperatures under _UNK ?
is it related to the _UNK of the _UNK ?
thermal cameras work in the infrared not in uv .
there are cameras that can sense temperatures below -10 c. however , these are expensive and require special lens material .
at such long wavelengths glass is no longer transparent .
materials like _UNK ( an _UNK metal in visible light but transparent in far infrared ) are used to make lenses .
the cameras also require cooling .
you can imagine that a warm camera trying to see _UNK would just see itself .
the lens and the _UNK array will glow and wipe out the image unless they are cooled to well below _UNK .
the signal from the cold object is also very weak so the cameras electrical noise becomes a big issue requiring more sophisticated electronics .
these concerns make such cameras very expensive .

how do you lay 6 cocktail sticks so they all touch each other ?
your question suggests you want an answer that only involves 2 dimensions .
this is not possible .
if you arrange the sticks in a star shape as has been suggested then once two sticks touch you can not get any more across the boundary they create .
if you are allowed into the 3rd dimension slightly then you can arrange the sticks as follows .
arrange two sticks in a v shape .
insert another stick into the v so it touches the other two sticks but does n't push them apart .

what is the ratio of maximum tension with minimum tension ?
if the pendulum _UNK with angular amplitude of 30 degrees how can i determine the ratio of maximum tension with minimum tension ?
really lookin for someone to help walk me through this process .
the first answer is partially correct .
the max tension is when the bob is straight down , but note that that the velocity is also a maximum at this point .
there is a normal acceleration of _UNK which increases the tension .
the tension is m ( g + _UNK ) .
note v is velocity and can be found from conservation of energy .
r is the length of the rope .
the minimum tension has no velocity component and comes only from the gravity component as the person above points out .

why does hot water clean better than cold water ?
first , this is a chemistry question , not biology .
second , any solvent can hold more in suspension when it is hot .
basically , hot water can dissolve more detergent , and more detergent can pick up more dirt particles .
third , any substance like oil or grease will have a lower viscosity at higher temperature and therefore flow more freely .
this will allow the water to rinse it away more easily , independent of detergent .
that 's why you run hot water to rinse greasy pans ; otherwise , the grease would tend to accumulate in the drain pipes and cause a _UNK .
note : if your question is about _UNK , only water above 180 degrees farenheit will do the trick .

why are radio telescopes so important to astronomy ?
several reasons : 1 ) radio waves go through the earth 's atmosphere , so we can detect them and stay on the ground .
this is also true for visible light , but is not true for uv , gamma , and other regions of the spectrum .
2 ) hydrogen has a particularly noticeable radio frequency and that helps us to make maps of where things are in the universe .
3 ) it is relatively easy to do _UNK with radio waves , so more _UNK can be obtained in some studies .
4 ) radio waves go through dust fairly easily , unlike visible light .
this allows us to _UNK ' things with radio that we could not see otherwise .
why salt will be spread on _UNK days ?
contrary to popular belief , salt does not react with ice to make water .

what is the _UNK effect in simple terms ?
all the previous answers are correct .
however , with regards to enthalpy and entropy remember what these terms mean .
while enthalpy is heat energy , entropy is ( essentially ) a universal tendency towards chaos .
so , _UNK interactions decrease the total enthalpy of a system and ( according to some fundamental physics ) increase the entropy of that same system .
the apparent paradox , proteins and lipids forming ordered systems ie .
_UNK , is _UNK when we take into account the ordering of water around these systems .
water molecules become much less ordered when _UNK components are allowed to form contacts .
this is known as decreasing the _UNK shell .
thus , all _UNK interactions are typically exothermic in nature and cause an increase in enthalpy of the system .

where do you use common factors in math in everyday life ?
greatest common factors and all that jazz maths in general are underrated in their use in everyday life .
when you go to the supermarket and compare prices of different sized packages you use common factors .
maths in school is taught in an isolated academic context .
teachers ( of which i am one ) need to relate their subjects to relevant everyday contexts to show the value of the knowledge .
when i was at school , i saw no value of calculus , then i discovered that it was very relevant in my trade .

how are _UNK rays used to treat water ?
explanation required in detail with diagrams showing how water can be _UNK using ultraviolet rays .
i think you should do your own homework .
but , a good place to start is to understand the basic idea .
ultraviolet light is higher in energy than visible light , which means that it can cause damage to living cells .
since you are a big organism , the uv wo n't kill you - unless you stay out in very , very bright sunlight for a long time .
then you 'll get seriously burned and probably get sick and possibly die from an infection .
however , a small organism like bacteria is usually only a single cell !
so the uv will damage their tissue enough to kill the bacteria .
good luck !

what are heating degree days and cooling degree days ?
it 's used for _UNK fuel costs .
each town has an average number of heating degree days for the winter and average number of cooling degree days for the summer .
with those averages , you can calculate how long the air conditioner or heater will run for the year and then calculate the fuel costs .
you can calculate it from the average temperature each day .
example : average temperature for jan. 1 is _UNK .
_UNK - _UNK = _UNK jan 1 is one day , so _UNK difference * 1 day = 35 heating degree days average temperature for jan. 2 is _UNK .
how do convert _UNK _UNK to _UNK ?
the answer `` _UNK and add 30 '' is incorrect .
a simple way that is 100 % accurate is to double the c temperature , then subtract 1/10 of that number , then add 32 .
for instance : 18 degrees c ; double that and you have 36 ; subtract 1/10 of 36 : 36 - _UNK = _UNK .
now add _UNK + 32 = _UNK .

what is _UNK inheritance and how does it affect your eye color ?
i think you are referring to _UNK inheritance .
this is the concept of multiple gene expression .
very simply , _UNK genetics usually suggests one gene pair or allele for any given _UNK or trait .
however , humans are just a _UNK more complicated than a pea plant .
because of this there is not just one gene pair or allele that _UNK eye color .
in fact there are a myriad of genes contributing to human eye color .
that is where the term _UNK comes in .
a person _UNK lots of genes coding for a lot of things .
in this particular case a person _UNK a lot of genes ( _UNK ) for one particular thing ( eye color ) .

why the sky is blue ?
the blue color of the sky is due to rayleigh scattering .
as light moves through the atmosphere , most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through .
little of the red , orange and yellow light is affected by the air .
however , much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules .
the absorbed blue light is then _UNK in different directions .
it gets scattered all around the sky .
whichever direction you look , some of this scattered blue light reaches you .
since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead , the sky looks blue .

determine the correct _UNK to be _UNK and ?
complete the graph by _UNK it .

this represents the equation y = 3 .
since the inequality is strictly greater than , the line should be _UNK ( or _UNK ) .
if it were > = then it would be a solid line .
now you test each half plane for a true value .
you need a point that is not contained on the line .
how about the origin ( that is always the easiest point as long as it is not on the line itself ) .
if we plug the point ( 0,0 ) into the inequality you get the statement 0 > 3 .
is this a true statement ?
no .
therefore , you shade the half plane that does not contain the origin .
if it were true , you would shade the half plane that contains the origin .
hope this helps !

besides going _UNK , is chicken healthier than beef ?
turkey ?
pork ?
this is complicated for a variety of reasons , but i wo n't go int o all of that .
the thing is : chicken is better than turkey unless you 're trying to fall asleep .

a pelvic exam is different from a biopsy .
the person above described a uterine biopsy .
a plain jane pelvic exam , also called a well woman exam or my personal favorite , `` going to the _UNK doctor '' .
is very simple and not painful at all .
the _UNK , or even a general practitioner , can do this .
this is when the doctor checks the cervix for abnormalities .
most docs use the newer method of using a small brush ( looks like a pipe cleaner on a stick to me ) to gather cells from your cervix .
these cells are then sent for testing and you may have to wait about a week for results .
in addition to this the doc will check your other female organs by pressing on your lower abdomen .
check out this site for details .
if this is your first one , try to relax your muscles as much as you can when having the exam .
oh , and do n't go too close to your period ... before or after .
best wishes to you .

use warm water to open your pores and a good facial cleanser ( i like _UNK ) to clean deep down inside your pores .
you should _UNK for 30 seconds and rinse thoroughly .
cold water will reduce the size of your pores but will not clean it .
for an added _UNK and deep cleaning effect , use a facial mask designed for deep cleaning and/or pore _UNK once a month .

yes , completely normal !
obviously we 're not talking _UNK here but a little curvature is perfectly normal .

it does n't feel hot or uncomfortable , and it does n't itch and it 's not swollen .
there is a defined margin to it so it looks like i got punched .
if anyone knows anything about what this may be , please contact me .

how many calories does a person have to have every day ?
generally , nutritional labels go off of the 2,000 or 2,500 calorie diet .
so , if you need more or less calories , you need to adjust .
it really depends on the person 's metabolism and activity level .
even body type can not determine how many calories a person needs each day .
for example , a big guy may have a slow metabolism , and _UNK , a small guy could have a high metabolism .
a person with higher metabolism needs more calories a day and vice-versa .
also , the more active you are , the more calories you need .
because , you will be burning up calories through your cardio exercises .
in addition , you probably have more lean muscle mass which burns calories as well .

i have a fairly high metabolism and i am pretty active .

some eat huge amounts of calories and protein to bulk up , some do n't worry so much about that .

why does your ankle swell when u _UNK it ?
i need 2 no y ur ankle swells when u _UNK it for my hw !
swelling occurs when ligaments are injured because the ligaments are _UNK connected with the functioning of the joints .
ligaments hold our joints together , helping to maintain the structural integrity of the skeletal system .
this increase in _UNK fluid causes the joint to swell .
this swelling is our body 's way of sending us a strong and important message .
if my _UNK was _UNK on _UNK and now _UNK today , that is more than doubling right ?
does it sound like multiples o or do i just have lots of hormones the doubling rule .
doctors can also perform quantitative serum beta _UNK levels .
the measurement is done in _UNK , and a level above 25 _UNK usually indicates the presence of a pregnancy .
two tests are usually necessary to verify a normal increase , usually 2-3 days apart .
the increase in serum _UNK can be _UNK monitored .
below an _UNK level of _UNK _UNK the _UNK usually doubles every _UNK hours , though a rise of _UNK % is still considered normal .
failure to increase normally may indicate that the pregnancy is not developing well and can be an early sign for a possible miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy .

your egg is only viable for about 24 hours after ovulation , but sperm can live for about 3 days in your vagina .

yes .
but everything in moderation .
as a _UNK it 's nice to see yourself progressing through the game , achieving good scores or passing levels things like that .
but one can become way too wrapped up in it and forget that the real world exists too .
games often promote critical thinking , problem solving skills , _UNK and not to mention determination .
even the `` bad '' games like _UNK or halo promote quick reflexes , sharp thinking and lots of determination .
just the opposite could also be said for games how they rot ones mind or make people lose their grip on reality .

to _UNK .
yes it was unprotected sex , i came off on the 4th and had sex on the 11th .
is there a chance yes .
anytime you have unprotected sex , you run the risk of getting pregnant .
unless your periods are `` textbook '' and are regular like _UNK , you can ovulate at any time .
`` textbook '' cycles work like this : the first day of your period is day 1 of your cycle .
you are most fertile day 14 thru 21 .
so if your period started on , for example the 1st , then you would be on day 11 of your cycle when you had sex .
if you _UNK 3 days early , it would be possible to get pregnant .
in all my experience working _UNK i would say to never never have unprotected sex unless you want to get pregnant .

their is no _UNK rule concerning this .
and just because somebody is emotionally weak now , does not mean they will be emotionally weak in the future .

questions about motrin ?
how can you tell someone you think they have bipolar disorder ( kindly ) ?
first of all i think you should leave that part to a professional .
but , to tell someone you think they may need to see a _UNK can be very tricky .
start by telling the person how much you care about them .
do n't push the conversation but try to let it come naturally .
they may get offensive but stress how concerned you are for them .
alot of times the one talk wo n't have an effect so if it does n't do n't get discouraged .
do n't nag but bring up on more occasions when you think your friend will be more _UNK .
maybe you 'll luck out the first time and your friend will be _UNK that you care enough to notice and seek help .
good luck .

`` a person is innocent unless proven guilty of a crime '' is this _UNK ad _UNK ?
no ; the failure of a court system to convict a person does not logically imply that a person is truly innocent of the crime .

if the system is reasonably sure a person is innocent , they are not punished .
the law is n't about strict logic as no empirical science can be , but is rather about fair and effective implementation of the law .

can i apply ms after i get associate degree ?
an associates degree usually takes 1-2 years to obtain .

an ms is specifically a master 's of science degree .
best of luck if you pursue either of those !

_UNK question ?
_UNK first of all its not an ip address , it a network id .
an ip address ca n't have 0 or _UNK as the last digit .
if its 0 then its network id and if its _UNK then it broadcast ip .
now `` _UNK '' i.e class c. hence first three _UNK for network and 1 octet for host .
5 _UNK ... _UNK 3 bits from host portion .
so that _UNK = 8. i.e you will get 8 _UNK out of which 6 are useful and since you require 5 so this will work .
clear up your concepts .

i am trying to add my own image to myspace for my background and it wo n't work .
please help !
the image you are trying to add is accessible from the internet , right ?
your image must have a valid url in order to be referenced from your myspace page .
i know a lot of people use photobucket for their image hosting needs .
the main thing is to make sure that the picture is being hosted on a server of some type that accepts requests from the internet , e.g .
a myspace page .

since china is a communist country and does n't practice democracy , freedoms are very limited .

after that i can not go online therefore i have to restart my pc so internet will work again .
thank you two possibilities : 1 ) your isp connection software has a _UNK configured to shut down your connection after an hour of _UNK .
solution : change the _UNK , or stop using the isp 's software and configure windows to connect without it .
you usually do n't need it .
2 ) your broadband device is using dhcp to assign your pc an ip address , and changing it frequently .
the pc does n't keep up , and when they get out of sync they do n't talk any more .
solution : configure the device to assign your pc a static ip based on its network card 's mac address .
your isp 's customer support should be able to talk you through either of these things .

how do i restore my lost taskbar icons ?
my comp is protected with symantec anti virus , now the icons in task bar ( right hand side below ) have disappeared , how do i restore them ?
you may loose the taskbar icons if the computer is booted in the safe mode .
ensure that its not booted in safe mode .
if the taskbar icons are missing even on a normal mode then it may be because the system has been booted in the selective startup mode .
3 ) ensure that you have the option normal startup selected .
if not select , normal startup and click on ok .
it may request you to restart the computer .
let the computer restart and you would find the icons back .
if you still do n't get the icons , it could be because that the program is uninstalled or corrupted .
can you turn off a pc at the powerpoint ?
and if not - why ?
i am referring to a home pc .
if i closed all the running programs and logged off , then just turn the pc off using the powerpoint would this harm it ?
i guess you 're saying either turn it off with the power switch or pulling the power .
neither way is a recommended method .
even if you 've closed all programs there are still processes running in the background in windows .
doing the shut down procedure in windows is the preferred way because it stops everything and then turns it off .
now sometimes it 's not _UNK such as during a _UNK but that 's the only time i would suggest doing that .
over many times of shutting the machine off _UNK you will get system errors .

http : _UNK good luck !
i bought a new lap top but when you close the lid and _UNK the screen is dead i have to restart why ?
if it is a windows system , what is happening is the system is going into _UNK when you close the lid .
_UNK causes all the internal electronics , including the display drivers to shut down as an energy and power savings technique .
you can change this by going into the control panel and selecting display .
somewhere in this folder are the options that allow you to select what you want the system to do under what conditions , such as lowering the display .
if you need help , select help on the menu bar and search for display power settings .

what are the advantages and disadvantages of using ajax ?
the advantage is the end product .
the end product will be a website that gives the user the same feel as an application on your own desktop .
a person could perform a function on your site , send the data to the server , get the results , all without ever refreshing the web page .
the disadvantage is the development .
it is difficult , _UNK , and the tools are not fully developed .
also , a lot of handling needs to be built into the site so that the user can understand what is happening .

the cheapest can often depend on what you have laying around .
i have often made `` network servers '' with old computers laying around .
simply find anything that can run linux or nt 4.0 , and put your drives in it .
the computer does not have to be very powerful , anything 200 mhz or higher should do just fine .
this is also a `` green '' solution , by recycling something that would have been thrown away otherwise .

there are reasons that these are blocked at your `` _UNK '' .
my guess is it is at school and you want to get out to play games without being caught by the internet filters .
these applications are put in place to protect not just the `` _UNK '' but also the `` _UNK '' .
even through _UNK .
proxy sites your nat ip address can be traced back to the _UNK location and you then make that place liable for anything that you do .
after your email : try this : open internet explorer .
_UNK _UNK click the lan settings button select the proxy server check box .
enter this ip : _UNK click ok until closed .
now your ie will let _UNK the filters .
is it possible that i can build a true or un true os in vb ?
i would say no .
vb depends too much on the operating system underneath it .
but with vb you 'd have to rewrite the entire vb run time which would require lots of reverse engineering and could not be done in vb itself !
now `` untrue '' os ?
you could write a `` simulation '' of an os in vb .
sure .
but it would be slow and would not be too useful .
i 've written _UNK for _UNK in vb , which is similar .
but that is n't really an os and really is n't very practical .
you might consider asking a more specific question about what you want to accomplish .

i copied all my files ( including os ) onto another hard drive , but some windows components apparently were not , such as windows task manager .

if you used imaging software to copy the hard drive , you may want to try formatting the new drive and trying it again .

i think any college you can get to will be the right step in getting where you need to go .

soccer _UNK ?
why ca n't you have more than one goalie ?
so ... i 've been watching the world cup .
when the other team has a corner kick or a penalty shot why ca n't the defending team put a few extra players there to grab the ball .
yes , it would probably be a penalty but it would save a goal .
my question is ... what is the penalty if a _UNK saves the ball from going into the goal with his hands ?
is it a goal ?
or does the other team get a free kick ?
a goal keeper is just an extra player in each game .
that 's why ten players plus a keeper is eleven which is an odd number .
the ten players are not supposed to touch the ball with their hands .
if they do so intentionally they can get a red or yellow card .
and to differentiate the players from the goalkeeper , the goalie must not wear the uniform the other players are wearing .
they should put on diffrent color , long or _UNK .

what do you think of jeff weaver ?
he 's been one of my favorite players since he was on the yankees ( even though i hate them ) .
its great he 's finally proved the world what he can do .
what do you think of him ?
weaver is a mediocre pitcher .
he has been his whole career .
he pitched very well in the world series , and he deserves credit for that .
but let 's not forget that he was so bad with the angels early in the season that they designated him for assignment .
weaver is a free agent , and he will command a big salary because there are few pitchers available on the market .
imo , whoever signs weaver will regret it .
he will have his moments , but he is very inconsistent .

what is +/- mean in hockey ?
every team has _UNK at every game , and the nhl does too , i think , to gather all the information .
a goal is scored for your team when your on the ice gives you a plus 1 .
if your on the ice when you get scored upon , you get a minus 1 .
this is not so much indicative of the player , more for the team strength and when a player is on the ice .
offensive forwards generally have plus ratings .
even the best defense man may have a minus rating .
a strong team that scores a lot and everyone on the team may be a plus .
best times !

advantages and disadvantages of banks loan ?
for the most part it depends on what type of loan you are talking about ... home loan ?
business loan ?
equity loan ?
the main advantage is getting the money you need for whatever you need .
the main disadvantage is the possibility of losing that asset if something happens that you can not afford to continue paying .
in some cases credit unions are better places to get loans than banks but it depends on the amount and use for the money .
if you do n't need a loan , do n't take one .
why pay interest on loans if you can simply save enough to pay cash even if that means waiting 10 years to avoid a 30 year mortgage ?
always try to pay more on your loans than minimum requirements to get the debt paid off , reduce the interest , and develop a shiny credit report .

the rate of return anticipated on a bond if it is held until the maturity date .

how do i create a transparent background ?
you need 2 lights to get contrast .
set one at 10 _UNK and one at 7 _UNK .
put a _UNK ( white paper ) in front of the 7 _UNK lite ( you want half the light from that one ) .
use a background with a single strong color ( not the same as the product ) that you can select in photoshop to delete out the background .
support the product on a rod ( stick it on using putty ) that is behind the product so it does not show .
keep the background as far away as possible and use as large an f stop as you can while keeping the whole product in focus .
that 's about it !

is there a legal way to cancel a automobile finance contract ?
i cant afford my current vehicle due to loss of income .
i am trying to figure out how to get out from under the contract .
no .
you need to realize when you finance a car , the finance company in essence owns the car .
that is why they have the title to it and you do n't .
what you need to do is as soon as possible call them and explain the situation .
most companies will work out something with you to help out for a few months while you look for new income .
the only other options you have is to sell the car , or allow the bank to _UNK it .
_UNK is the last resort because it destroys your credit and the bank does n't want the hassle of _UNK the car at a loss .

your credit rating is a _UNK of how safe of an investment you are .

if you have _UNK loans you are not necessarily considered to be an unsafe _UNK .
however if you miss payments or some of your loans are credit card based and near or at the credit limit you would be considered risky .

due to this if you are getting this consolidation loan near to another loan you received you could damage your credit rating slightly .
however , paying off high interest loans with the consolidation loan and then making your payments on time would do more good than bad .

if you have to say you 're a gangster ... .
does n't that make you a _UNK ( _UNK gangster ) ?
rappers call themselves gangsters all the time .
if you have to say it , you ai n't one .
it 's like walking around going `` i 'm so cool ! ''
or `` i 'm not gay ! ''
or `` i 'm not a sexy korean girl ! ''
why do people use & & in im 's ?
on myspace or aim people use & & for bad example : `` i saw alex & & he gave me a ride so i didnt have to walk .
one more thing , bring your pen & & paper to my house '' how are you supposed to pronounce the double & & ?
it’s a conjunction that many myspace people use , which results in a truly horrific sentence .
it is pronounced _UNK _UNK and originated with programming languages , which use this command for _UNK logical operations .
that said , the proper use of & & ( if so be one ) would function much like the _UNK is the longer _UNK and demonstrated _UNK .
the _UNK kids tend to _UNK this punctuation by inserting it everywhere an _UNK is present .
it is not functional as such and is better used to replace a dash .
what should you look for in buying your first cello ?

best of luck to you , i think the cello is way cool !

a man dies and _UNK 17 camels to his 3 sons .
to the _UNK son , he gives 1/2 .
to the middle son , he gives 1/3 .
to the youngest , he gives _UNK .
the sons are confused because it seems they may have to slaughter one of the camels in order to fulfill their father 's wishes .
however , a wise man arrives at the scene riding upon his own camel and solves the problem for the three sons .
no camels needed to be slaughtered , and the father 's wishes were fulfilled .
the wise man bid farewell as he rode away on his camel .

add them up and you get 17 .

why is britney spears partying so much when she 's got two little ones to care for ?
it 's very simple .
she cares more about partying than she does about her children .
she can say whatever she likes -- that they mean the world to her .
that they are the most important thing in her life .
that she would do anything for them .
anything that does n't interfere with her partying , obviously .
that 's where she has drawn the line .
behaviour is more indicative of what one feels and believes than what comes out of their mouths .

the sex was great for us both .
it was n't planned but just happened .
now he feels bad and so do i , how can we get past that .
it 's hard , but some time apart to digest what happened will help .

lets move forward .
and accept whatever comes your way .
if he wants to end it , okay , you 'll find someone better who 'll stick around after sex .
if he wants to work it , take it a little slower until he 's comfortable again .
but it 'll work out .
you just need a little time to get over all of this .
good luck !

a girl that is _UNK and has an opinion .
i 'm okay with some _UNK , but not _UNK .

whe knows what she wants and goes for it .
i also like a girl who 's not afraid to argue with me .

just take your time and do what feels right .
i know it sounds simple but there is no perfect way to kiss .
think about it , when you kiss someone do you want them to think that you are just like everyone else ?

do girls look in the money factor when choosing for long term boyfriend ?
just asking whether money is a important factor when a gal choose a boyfriend ?
well , we look at it and consider it a lot .
fortunately , there are still girls willing to look away from a guy 's financial difficulties .
take note , this happens when a girl is already decided that she loves the guy .
just try to take it slow before _UNK the long term issue .
that way , she would have seen a lot of good character from you and it would be easier to put the money thing aside .
show her that you can compensate for that with something else : )
im not sure if a guy likes me ?
and if you read my details and think he does > how do i approach him ?
dude looks at me at least once a day .

i am a bit confused , should i take interest for the sake of making my first gf or should i play it slow .
how should i react when i meet her ?
definitely do n't make her your girlfriend for the sake of having one .
just be friends .
how many people can say that you `` know for a fact '' that you are not being cheated on , and how do you know ?
in any relationship you have to have an open and honest line of communication .

i can pick up the phone and call him .
also he 's at home with me every night .

we are very good family friends i.e .
my family and my girls family .
but my mom & dad kind of like her just 60 % .

i really want to contact her but i 'm not .
well learn from your mistakes .

can someone tell me about.. ?
can someone tell me about anal sex ?
i just gave my fiance `` permission '' and want to know what to expect .
thank you : ) lubrication , lubrication , lubrication .
that is the most important part of anal sex .
it can be quite enjoyable if he takes things slow and uses a condom that is well _UNK .
also it is important that you do your best not to tense up .
that will cause it to hurt .
if it hurts , tell him to stop where he is and then work to make yourself relax those muscles .
it 's possible to tense them without really realizing that you did .
it 's very important that you 're not afraid to communicate with him during something like this .
you ca n't just let him go to town .
it 's a process .
but once you get it down , it can be a wonderful addition to your sex life .
good luck and have fun .
need some opinions ... .. ?
i 'm a single 23 yr old and am in a professional field and at a point in my life where i want to have children .
i am thinking about having a child and raising the child on my own , just wanted peoples opinions on it .
if you are financially able to provide and support a child on your own then you should go for it as long as your also mentally ready .
but you dont need to have a `` man '' in your life just to have a baby .
there are many women they are _UNK and raise their child on their own without the help of a husband or boyfriend .
hope this helped good luck .
in a male and female relationship who gives there all and all in the realtionship ?
stop the madness !
there is no such thing .
i have heard some say the woman but lets stop for a moment and think .
both parties give .
they just give in different ways .
so neither the man nor woman is superior in this regard .
you can get the whole spectrum from bad to good from both .
i am sure you have heard of men that are giving and same applies to women that just take .
so just think about things with an open mind and usually you will see that stereotypical ideas hold no water .
its just a lazy way to label people .
does this new guy that i just met really like me ?
no , he thinks you are easy and just wants to score .
oh wait , the crystal ball says yes , he is your true love .
oh wait , the magic eight ball says definitely no .

what can give me more confidence ?
i 'm not ugly by any means .

anxiety takes over and i start sweating always worrying about what the other person is thinking about me .
i need help !

someone help me with my boy problem ?
i like this boy and it seems like he might like me _UNK dont want to wait on him to ask me out .
i really want to ask him out bu i have like a rejection phobia .
what should i do ?
we all fear rejection , but you ca n't live your life in fear .
if you do you will miss out on a lot of good things in life including this guy .
if you let fear rule you and some other girl asks him out then you will always regret it .
rejection sucks and hurts but it is still better than always wondering what might have been .

does everybody eventually want to settle down and not keep on `` chasing '' ?
when , in your opinion , are people ready to settle down ?
it tends to be once they are secure in themselves .
people can also want to do this because they are not secure .
if that makes sense ... _UNK tend to be the first option ( waiting _UNK they 're secure in themselves ) and women tend to be the latter .
it also depends on the maturity of th individual , i would imagine .

married for two years , seperate bank _UNK .
children from previous marriages and x spouses .
it should as long as you have do n't have any debts tied to the business in both of your names .
usually your debt is your debt and his debt is his debt if it was owned before coming into the marriage .
we could be wrong but an attorney can lead you in the right direction .
even so , divorce should n't be an option to keep yourself from owing money .
please consider this _UNK .
and to the post above : it 's you 're !
not your .
i am assuming you are saying she is pathetic not that she owns being pathetic .

his books are quite informative and have also served to assist the wider public .
but put yourself in his shoes , how would you feel if you had to deal with and listen to all those problems everyday ?
he deserves every cent he has .
me & my bf are so stressed , what can i do that could cheer him up and make him feel special .
any advice forget them ... _UNK , just go and do sumthing fun together , to bring the happiness back and get ur mind off things .
maybe take him to a _UNK , or to a _UNK game or sumthin if thats wot he likes .
sumthin that u know will _UNK get his mind off it .
but plz , dnt just ignore the pregnancy .
u should both talk about it very seriously aswell .
dnt wait till u find out and then freak out .
its not healthy .
plan ahead .

if you boyfriend does n't want to hold hands and thinks it 's embarrassing , does that mean he does n't like you ?
no it does n't .
some people think that their private life is just that , private .
dome are just not comfortable with public display of emotions .
my husband and i are both like that .

my ex girl broke up with me and sometimes my ex looks at me but she does not talk to me .
but she is having fun than when we went out or before we went out .

_UNK name changes ... ?
i find this tradition really offensive .
women say they want to change their name to show commitment to their husbands .
but what about their husband 's commitment ?
should n't they change their name too ?
please , i 'd like to know why this tradition continues and how come more women are n't pissed off that this is expected from them ?
i did n't change my name when i married , because i do think it 's outdated .
we have two children who have my husband 's last name .
what i find offensive is when they try to give you the first name , too , as in `` mrs. john smith . ''
for heavens ' sake .
i do n't know why this tradition has continued , but it is difficult to find a solution that is concise and clear .
either you have to explain and defend having a different name , or you have to adopt both , which gets pretty _UNK .
what should i do if this boy asked to marry me but i didnt give him a answer .
im not sure yet but i luv him .
after another year we had both found good jobs , finished school and settled in nicely together .
we then had a wonderful wedding ( plus she got a much better engagement and wedding ring !
; ) ) just be honest and straightforward .
if he loves you as much as you love him , he will wait until you are ready .
hope this helps , and best of luck !

i 'm starting to fall in love with my best friend 's sister , she 's two years younger than me .
i 'm not sure what to do talk to your best friend about it .
and you should be very respectable about it to .
do n't just go to him and say `` hey i wan na bone your sister really bad '' .
all joking aside , if you guys are close and your a good guy , he will be glad she is with you and not some scum bag .

is it possible for a man to fall in love with a women after being with her for a week ?
my boyfriend who i just met last week is claiming he loves me .
how is this possible ?
because some people do tend to fall quickly , they are also more likely to tire quickly as well ... _UNK rush in .
real relationships are based on time , connections , and chemistry ... _UNK caution .
i have been with me b/f for 4 years and he doesnt want people to know yet what should i do ?
say he ca n't be _UNK !
you deserve better than a man who regrets what you really are !
ok guys , young women in 20s who is chubby or older woman say 30s who is skinny ?
both are kinda cute who do you choose ?
the first one that will have me , i 'm not shallow .
may the best girl win ...
on a first date with a friend , what do i say to sweep her off her feet ?
we are going out to `` lunch '' but i really want to try to start a _UNK with her .
we have been friends for 3 years .
i just want good things to happen .
it 's not much what you say as all the other `` little '' things you must do on the date .
as for conversation , keep it light , funny , interesting .
and although you may want to start a relationship with her , on your first `` real '' date , you probably should n't bring that up as yet .
wait until you 've been on at least 3 dates , then _UNK the subject .
by then you 'll know if she 's also romantically interested in you or if only as a friend .
teach me ... ?
my heart is crushed .
there is a girl i have been talking to through e-mail .
i am just getting out of a relationship and we do n't know each other well so we decided to take it slowly .
she said in time she can tell me if she likes me too .
but now she says that she sorta likes someone else and thinks they might like her to .
so i 'm really confused and do n't want to get too invested but i do n't want to not try at all .
so what should i do ?
getting over her will not be easy .
she is the most beautiful girl i 've seen and i really like her mind and heart .
you should just stay friends with her .
it might work out if you do n't get too pushy with things
how can i forgive my guy for lying to me ?
move on .
if he 's lying about this what else might he be lying about ?

please contact _UNK @ yahoo.com contact social services in _UNK they may be able to help .

depends on the girl .
i have done it in the past .
i would do it again , but i would prefer to get to know her a little bit _UNK jumping into the sack for fear of getting a std .

those are n't good odds at all !

_UNK is a small mistake .

i 'm in love with someone on the other side of the country !
what do i do ?
i 'm in love with someone of the other side of the globe literally .
if it 's _UNK here , it 's _UNK on her side of the globe .
it 's damn hard .
since you 've got more options than i do and i wish i 'm in your shoes right now .
if i 'm in your shoes right now , i 'd call .
let me see , i 'm a guy and you 're a girl .
we have a different position but the same case .
if i 'm the guy , whatever you do does n't really matter if i do n't like you .
if i like you , i 'd enjoy getting in touch with you .

is there any girl who likes to break heart ?
that is the strangest thing i have ever heard .
someone who actually like getting hurt .
well if mental pain makes you feel good , why not try physical and let someone knock some sense into you .
what do i do if i am gay but do not want to be ?
i get no pleasure from a woman , but do from a man and hate it what do you mean you hate it ?
because a lot of stupid straight conservative people hate it ?
if that 's who you are then who the hell should care whether your gay or not !
people who are _UNK against gay people are themselves insecure , _UNK , _UNK , and have no respect !
there is nothing unnatural about loving someone of the same sex , there 's no harm being done .
like the saying goes make love , not war .
stand up to what you believe in because it will make a difference someday , to not just yourself but the world !

what 's so bad about being a back up ... anything ?
as long as you get some of the sweet stuff ( and not all the baggage ) you should count yourself lucky .
shoot for a friendship with benefits but do stay friends .
if you do n't expect more than a friendship then maybe you will not be disappointed .
good friends are hard to find .

i just caught my man masturbating in front of computer , and every instinct says to kick him to the curb ... ?
but i would like some more advice besides throwing away my marriage .
men are visually stimulated , and all men masturbate .
it makes us ladies angry , and it hurts us too , but it is n't always something we should take personally .
talk to him about it , after you cool down .
what really bothers you about it ?
tell him , and maybe it will be fine , and you 'll learn somethings about him you did n't know .
oh , and just an after thought , did you wipe off the keyboard before you asked the question ?
: ) keep smiling
who is better at giving oral sex ... _UNK or females ?
let 's answer that question with some more questions , shall we ?
when you go down on a woman , where are you focused and is that where she wants you focused ?

if so , what are you doing with them - in other words , what kind of motion are you making ?
do you listen to how she 's breathing ?
what does it mean when she holds her breath ?
what does it mean when her legs tense up ?
if a man knows the right answers to all those questions , he 's in the game .
if not , she 's better at giving than him , guaranteed .

if you are the direct type , bring him to a nice place and confess !
why is akward to be in the same room with an _UNK ?
you shared a relationship with that person that is like no other .
you know each other in a different way than anyone else ever will .

plus , you have the added _UNK of other people around you knowing you 2 as a couple so it is mildly wierd for them as well .

why do some men refuse to commit to a relationship or want to ever marry ?
first of all why do some men marry ?
to celebrate their relationship , to belong to the woman they love , to have a friend , to have a family of their own .
i guess the others refuse because of fear of taking responsibility ( once you are _UNK , all major decision of life are influenced by it e.g.
, changing job , moving to new location etc. )
or fear of _UNK in other person so much as to make them a part of your life and become theirs .
some do not believe in the institution of marriage because for their own reasons .
women generally want to stay in a relationship & work on it even if it is not going on the right track with the hope that it might work .
guys dont .
they know if its not a correct choice , its not worth giving life for .
and for some , variety is the spice of life : ) )

use _UNK instead .
yes , she has been a real mom to you by _UNK you to your _UNK parents .
but your _UNK parents have been real parents by raising you till now .
if you say `` real mom '' about your _UNK , then is your mom your `` fake mom '' ?
i 'm sure you did n't mean anything negative by it , but trust me it will hurt your _UNK parents to hear it .

i asked this question earlier in the society section but think i will get a more interesting set of answers here .
social pressure is an issue , but the key is social gradient .

does a diffrence of 9 years make diffrence in husband and wife relation ?
depends on your sister .
she will probably be well taken care of and a lot of women would prefer that over any deep relationship .
women do want `` security '' to feel comfortable in a relationship .
the guy has been in school for a whole 8 years longer than most people so he is probably emotionally 8 to 10 years younger anyway .
he gets a trophy wife and she gets the much sought after `` security '' .

well i just recently gone through a break up but im so attached to this boy that i cant get over him wat 2 do ?
my boyfriend of almost 9 month and i broke up last week and i still have the strongest feelings for him and its been hurting so much .
im sorry .
how old is everyone here ?
jst put ow old u r _UNK one foot in the grave .
if you broke up from your man from cheating , but still love him , he proofs he 's change , would u take him back ?
guys can answer too .
but if you say that you love him and truly mean it and you believe in your heart that he has changed his ways then go for it .
but by going back to a relationship like that you know that he has done it before so you risk being his fool and getting hurt again .
i like this girl and i want to ask her out but i dont want to be embarrassed in front of _UNK ; what should ?

where i find these types of _UNK ?
where do we start ?
why girls make a big deal of `` i love you '' ?
seems like when i said it was a big deal for her .
i dont remember when i said that .
she just reminded me because they expected that you meant those words , not that you did n't even remember when you said them .
it would probably also be because they felt that way about you .
saying `` i love you , '' in the heat of the moment is wrong , and girls should realize that .
some are young or innocent , though , and do n't .
so , do n't say those precious words unless you mean them .
hi , whats the best wary to _UNK about someone that you really for a long time ?

_UNK : how do you improve your orgasm ?
any tips or techniques that you are willing to share ?
well , i 'm a girl and the only way that a person can improve an orgasm is to spend more time on the foreplay .
that is the build-up and the orgasm is the release .
so if the peak is higher the fall will be father and longer .
if all else fails , bring in some `` aids '' to help you out .
not only can you have one , you can have more .
and how can that be any better ?
i am 26 i dont like younger guys , how old is to old for me to go when dating ?
before i married my husband ... who happens to be 1 year younger than me ... .i had always dated older men .
some slightly older some were quite a bit older .
i was 24 or 25 when i started seeing a guy who was 28 .
after him i dated a guy who was 42 .
so it all depends on who you find attractive .
gosh when i was 21 i was seeing a guy who was 45 or 46 , he was a real piece of work though .
so really there is no age limit ... just your own preference is mandated .
go out ... have fun ... .and enjoy life !

ur too young 2 think about relationship & if a guy smile or looking at u , he wants 2 get attention frm u or just 4 fun .
ask him if u want the answer but be careful .
why does my girlfriend love ace young so much ?

it is still something special that you will be able to share with the guy of your dreams one day .

my husband started smoking crack 1 1/2 years ago .
i put him in rehab but he started using again .
now he swears he wants off the drugs .
i want him to go to _UNK for long term _UNK .

he needs a tough love environment .
if i loved my husband very much , i would be on his ass non stop ... keeping him busy with other things .
painting , cleaning , anything to keep his hands busy .
but he will go through a huge depression period .
it will not be easy .
why does my 29 year old son live with his mother ?
good looking son _UNK not enough info to answer this question .
if he is your son , why are n't you asking him ?
i 'm sure he would explain his _UNK to you .
maybe he feels like he needs to be there to protect her and , since he is n't married , he is free to do that .
if you are divorced from her , he might feel that he needs to protect her since the world is n't always safe for women .
he probably pays rent and helps her to afford the place .
maybe she does n't have enough money to afford to live on her own .
many women end up in poverty after a divorce .
as i said , these are only `` guesses '' since you have n't given any background information so do n't take any of my `` _UNK '' personally .
just saying you need to ask him since we do n't know the entire story .

you ca n't force her not to be shy .
kiss her on the forehead instead of the lips .
kiss her fingers too .

my best friend is my 3 year old sister .
i desperately need help making friends .
i am 12 years old and i do n't have any friends at school .
i probably only had about 5 friends in my entire life , all which were the kids of my parents ' friends .
i am really lonely and wish i had someone to call and talk to whenever i 'm having a problem .
nobody at my school even notices me .
you will grow out of this as you start to mature and grow into your self .
you still dont know who you are yet .
most 20 year olds dont know who they are yet or where they want to be in life .
as time goes on and you start to determine which direction life is taking you , you will begin to make friends like you .
give it some time .
be _UNK ( probably not spelled right ) introduce yourself to people make yourself known .
can you just sleep with someone ?
i have been in an _UNK relationship with this man for the last 2yrs .
he says its only sex , but i think there is more , so is it possible he is just in it for the sex ?
is this a question ?
if he just wants sex , then you do n't belong together .
if he just wants sex , then you are not in a relationship .
you are sex buddies .
if you want a relationship , go find one .
when you find someone interesting , have one last _UNK with your sex buddy and tell him it 's been fun .
but if you ca n't help feeling committed to a man who does n't care about you , then you 're going to get yourself hurt .
so stop sleeping with him .
how do i get my girlfriend to try a threesome ?
well , i 've managed to do it twice .
each time it started with talking about her sexual _UNK .
the common fantasy was about them interacting with another woman .
this led to hot bedroom action .
next , watch movies that have hot sex scenes and discuss them .
talk about how they made her feel emotionally .
try `` wild things '' or something similar for the girl on girl action .
follow that with more great sex .
through the movies , i learned that both were curious about strip clubs and we went together and watched .
again , hot action followed back at home .
it is _UNK -- you have to do it slowly and gradually .
women 's desires are n't that far off from men 's .
you must make a woman feel safe in her environment and in their relationship with you or it probably is n't going to happen .
if it does n't , you will have had a lot of great sex trying , so you are out absolutely nothing .
any veggie , 40s , in london or about ?
nope .

i have been _UNK sex with my gf 4 last 3 months but now she is not into it ?
if she is not into it , do n't do it .
if you are with her just for that , then you should leave her and find the girl you will be with for her , not for that .
try talking to her .
find out why she is n't into it .
maybe you will have to give it up for a bit .
why are my friends so embarrassed to go out with me ?
you are beautiful just forget all those jealous people out there .

what do i do when a man i am in love with wants me only for my money .
turn away from him , as fast as you can .
whenever he meets somebody with more money , you will be history or he will double dip .
then you will feel terribly used and low , because he took advantage of you .
i was in a similar situation , so i speak from experience .
i was too blind to notice until i found out he was going out with two more people .
man can perceive this , and they really take advantage .
i wish you meet somebody with good feelings towards you .
there are plenty of men in the world .
good luck .
what you do feel when your in love ?
your body releases chemicals that are very similar to tweak ( as in speed or crystal meth ) .
so you lose your _UNK and feel a bit _UNK .
but then when that all wears off , if the girl is still as great as when you first started falling in love with her , the magic happens .
you feel like you are only really complete when you are together .
like part of you is missing when she is n't there .
you know you would do anything to save her from a burning building ( or any other threatening situation ) even if you know it would kill you .

you should live with a guy .

it 'll be a sticky situation .
unless your not straight , then it would be the other way around .
a rich husband who dosent care or a poor husband who cares ?
choose ?
definitely a poor husband who cares .
you can always make money by finding a good job and become rich .
but you can never change the character of any person who is no care type and who goes behind money , who does n't care for any relations .

guys ... .what do u notice ?
what do you notice in a girl ?
i always notice the way a woman _UNK herself from the first step .
when she first says anything to you if the eye contact stays during that first conversation , normally she speaks truth and that 's a good start .
her style of clothes , the make up she wears and her physical condition tells you how in control of herself she is .
once all of that is _UNK , then its the _UNK .
i saw a woman just today that everything about her said sexy ... except for her eyes .
i soon learned she had a small problem with her car and needed someone to help her .
the eyes will always give it away .
i love him but he beats _UNK should i do ?
real love never dies , but people do !
ladies , what do you expect your man to get you this valentines day ?
explain in full detail ... ?
in my opinion , if you love somebody , you do n't expect for anything in return .
so basically i do n't expect anything .
i 'll just be happy that the love in our hearts for each other remains .
if your significant other goes clubbing & dances on another person in front of you or not , is that cheating ?
i would consider it cheating , b/c your pretty much dry _UNK the way dancing is nowadays .
its like having sex on the dance floor with clothes on .
if a woman dances on a guy , the boyfriend will get mad & the woman says its just dancing .
but if a guy dances on another girl , the woman will get defensive and wonders if your into the girl or just dancing .
its not _UNK think hes just trying to get you jealous .
you do the same n see how he feels
how can i add more intimacy and four play to my relationship ?
such as new and exciting things to do tie your partner up and tease them for awhile till you finally have sex with them

my favorite is a _UNK dong .

what is the _UNK of an emotional , _UNK working wife vs ?
loving , practical , _UNK , _UNK husband ?
some serious inputs !

the fun loving working wife with emotions can help the husband see things in a different light .
neither partner should expect to change the other 's attitudes but if they accept eachother as they are and love eachother it can work quite well .
is it smart to go back out with one of your ex girlfriends that broke up with you ?
even if you do really like or maybe love them .

in fact i look nothing like it ... .there are no fat 52 year old avatars available
how can you get your boyfriend to just a little bit more romantic things with you .
they ca n't be trained , or _UNK , my dear .
has to come from within , when they realize it 's the right thing to do .
for example : i knew a girl who wanted to try indian food .
she mentioned this once ; so without saying a thing before , next time we went to dinner , we tried one .
she instantly remembered telling me - mucho points for eli !
so be patient - or look for a guy who actually listens to you !
- eli

infatuation : 1 .
a foolish , _UNK , or _UNK passion or attraction .

is sex an absolute factor or just a _UNK for you ?
how old do you have to be to be considered a sugar daddy ?
i 'm just curious to know if this is a hobby or just a way of being needed .
i used to have one .
i think he was just lonely .
he spent his life with his wife and after she passed he looked for _UNK .
i did n't take advantage of him .
i remained his friend and in return he extended his kindness as well .
he took care of the things i would allow him to .
i believe that was the thrill for him ... .
just knowing that he could be needed again at times .
at what age you lost your virginity ?

clothes for guy to wear , _UNK him look like a man ?
ladies , what styles & brands should a guy wear casually and professionally so that he looks like a respectful , mature gentleman ?
i think u should go with some nice _UNK , _UNK or polo or something , but loose .
not _UNK just loose .
then go with a button down .
usually _UNK looks best .
do n't buy the ones in a package those are old man shirts .
look on the _UNK .
usually _UNK ( if u have one in your area ) has nice clothes .
love letters ?
does any one out there used or still receive love letters or notes from your sweetheart ?
or is it only e-mails & text messages now !
what do you think about love letters , is ti still on or is something from the past ?
love letters are great and are more personal then an email or txt .
because their hand written their more special .
me and my partner used to write love letters before we moved in together !
i think more couples should write them rather than use modern technology to declare their love !

thoughts ?

- would be my main question here .
i was much more impressed with the fact that my husband owned a home and managed his money well .

for example : friends are like pillows , they are comforting .
they can be funny like friends are like banks , you can always _UNK money from them .
i ca n't use these because they were the teacher 's examples .
they can be sweet , sad , funny , anything .
plz help .
thanks and god bless you !

make plans on when and how you are going to slow down - together .

= )
_UNK wrong with me ?
any idea ?
no need to worry .
many people feel pressured into thinking they have to have lots of relationships and date just like everybody else ... but you do n't !
if you do n't trust the guys , then you are totally justified in not staying with them .
how do you have a good relationship if you are not very _UNK ?
there is much more to a relationship than affection .
personally i love affection , but there are those that are _UNK , and they lead healthy strong relationship .
the key is the connection between the two in the relationship .
if one person lives for affection and the other hates it well then that 's a recipe for disaster .
then on the other hand if the person feels other things are important in the relationship like kindness or emotional support or even financial support .
they the relationship will be _UNK it really boils down to the individuals in the relationship .
there dozens of things that make people compatible and _UNK .
affection is just one aspect ... good luck .
what do you do if you love your boyfriend but want to be with someone else ?
i dont want to be with him because he makes me feel like crap but on the other hand i love him so much !
someone help me put things right .
_UNK ... there is an old saying .
if you _UNK a fence , all you get is a sore crotch !
step over to one side or the other !
by the sounds of it , if your b/f makes you feel like crap , then you should be looking to move on and find someone that wo n't .
a man worth having lets you know and feel that you are special , and important to them .
so , if your current b/f makes you feel like crap , then take your dump and move off the fence .
good luck !
i am worried about first night of marriage !
how can i give my wife at first night a super sexual relation beside every other thing that life requires ?
it 's not all about the first night !
sex is not a magical thing that you get right the first time .
a loving relationship works because sex changes and grows as your relationship does .
it wo n't always be great , and as long as you are ok with that , it gets better with time and communication !
you have to talk to each other to learn what you like and do n't like .
internet dating ?
why do most girls on online dating sites post old photos to fool guys and prefer to hide than to show themselves honestly to guys .
they never look like their picture ?
what 's up girls ?
desperate has nothing to do with it i 'm a , single parent i choose to raise my child than worry about me .
meeting someone online just a better way of expressing yourself things you can not say face to face .
which part on a girl attract guys the most , the _UNK , breast , _UNK or the face ?
personally , i really love the breast .
it 's the gods gift to all of us !
i should pick all of the above but what i like the most is breast .
i agree with you 100 % breast is the best thing girls could ever have .
how do you get over a broken heart ?
its not easy .
time is the only real way .
although memories stay with us forever , their effects diminish with time .
you will feel better eventually but like i say , it will take time ...

does love mean sex now a days ?
hello guys and girls , does love mean sex now a days .
i mean have you come across any relationships with out physical relation ships ?
do you agree with me that sex brings more care _UNK your partner ?
please be _UNK in your answers .
the truth is they are not the same .
but sad to say , people treat them as if you ca n't love without having sex .
although , it is somewhat the expression of love .
sex is a gift from god for married people , it is supposed to be sacred in the _UNK of marriage .
in my opinion , wait till you are married then have sex all you want .
that is why i respect the filipino culture that says something about this .
sad to say too , we are slowly losing it .
though some still believe that sex should be done only when you are married .
and i believe that .
there is nothing like having it first with your husband ... it will be grand !
wht is difference between involving sex ?

if you do n't kiss her on the first date , you are likely to get the `` we are just friends '' disease .

how many people do n't get engagement rings ?
i 've heard of couples with really cheap _UNK rings or just none at all ... yes , it happens .
but i 've found the `` cheap '' rings usually mean more than the expensive ones .
when my husband and i got married , we were poor college students with no jobs so he could n't afford an engagement ring .
the man we bought it from warned it was expensive .
since my husband had $ 10 , he got me the ring and to this day we refer to it as my `` very expensive ring '' .
although he now has a good job and we are no longer poor , i love that ring and will never get another one .
for me , it is worth more than all the gold and diamonds in the world .
is it wrong to only want one partner for the rest of your life ?
no .

that 's how it was meant to be .
showing a lifetime commitment .

if you think back about your relationship , you will probably realize that she was using and abusing you all along .

sometimes we are so _UNK with the other person that we choose to close our eyes to all the hurtful things they do , hoping it will get better .
but things will only get worse until we say `` enough ! ''
remember you are of value .
it is an honor to be with you , not a right .
expect more respect from the other person .
if you truly give unconditional love , then you should expect to get it back .

they 're my best friends in the world .
if i went out with one of them , my friendships with them could be ruined .
what should i do ?
first of all , do you like any of them .
if you do then it might be problematic if the 4 of you dont sit down and discuss whats up .
if you dont like them then at some point you will have to tell them how you feel .
they certainly have made it obvious to you how they feel .
the more important issue is to keep the friendship first ; that is what all 4 of you need to look at .
sit down and make sure that the 4 of you understand that at the end of the day you want to be each others best friend .
now there is no guarantee that can happen .
what can be said is that by talking it out you know how everyone feels about the situation .

so , yes , we do project to some extent .

we are all individual .
what i think is real love to me , might not be for you .

its unlikely that they are just going to come knocking on your door looking for you .
if you are really serious about finding a girlfriend you 're going to have to invest some time and actually date .
you could try online like yahoo personals or meeting people out and about .
if you really ca n't invest the time then just get yourself a prostitute .

he is not there just because he wants to find a way to make your life miserable .

are men who wear panties gay , bi or straight est percentage for each ?
i think what they wear does n't determine their sexual orientation .
there are straight men who enjoy wearing women 's underwear for the excitement of it being `` naughty '' and the thought of `` getting caught '' .
i would venture a guess that the vast majority who do this are straight or bi , and not as many are gay .
not sure why i think this , and i 've never dated a man who 's wanted to wear my undies .
i guess it 's just based on the psychology of it .
either way , if it makes the guy happy and their partners enjoy it , too , more power to 'em !
guys are hopeless ?
it either friends or driving him totally away
if not , tell him ur not .
if he says he will dump you , dump him because a person who really cares for u would not dump u for not having sex with them

love and lust ?
what is the difference ?
which comes first ?
well , there is a huge difference .
you can feel those things for anyone , your sisters , your children , your friends , even your pet .
lust is a strong physical attraction , a craving for someone if you will , that is hard to control , trust me , lol .
it is difficult to say which comes .
i think it depends on the situation .
if you 're friends with someone and then become attracted to them then it is obvious that love would come first .
it varies certainly .

am i being logical about my choice to this situation ?
my husband wants to start a _UNK with his friend promoting _UNK at clubs .
i told him that i support him in whatever he is doing but he should try out the first event first to see how the outcome is .

what do guys want to find in a _UNK ?
this is an easy question and yet complex .
every guys will want different things .
i like long hair , preferably red .
an attractive figure is also great .
superficial _UNK aside , she needs to be able to carry a conversation .
i would rather have an average looking girl that is equally smart and can hold an intelligent conversation , rather than a perfect 10 that all guys _UNK over .
with a girl that is extremely beautiful you sometimes wonder if she is being faithful .
that takes allot of faith on the guys part to trust her just as it takes trust for the girl to think the guys is not cheating .
if the girl ca n't say anything smart allot of people will look at her and _UNK she is a _UNK .
i know i am _UNK on so , in my opinion intelligence , good looks , loyalty , willingness to compromise , _UNK .

it walked over to the bed and lifted my foot up by the big toe about 15 inches off the bed .
i screamed and it disappeared into itself .
my mother heard my scream and i told her never mind , i thought i saw a ghost .
in the morning i heard her laughing about it with my dad so i told her about how it lifted my big toe up into the air .
she _UNK and then told me that that was how her mother used to wake her up of a morning .
my _UNK has been deceased since i was 7 years old .
i havnt seen her since but i would like to .
she is obviously watching over me .
why love is there in all of our lives ?
love is very important in our lives .
if no love u wouldnt be ther to type such a question .

how would you feel if your boyfriend kissed another female ?
i do n't know about you but i have zero tolerance for that stuff .
how can i get my guy friend that we have been friends for 3 years to get him to like me ?
more than a friend ?

he may be just trying to spare your feelings .
my advice is to let it go for awhile and maybe just maybe he 'll come around .
if not then just be thankful for the friendship

i think that this would be a mistake .
i know that my husband _UNK says things about a _UNK , but in the end he would have a problem with it .
he would hate knowing that another man has touched me that way .
i do n't think he would be able to look at me the same way .

men and women both play mind games , some more than others , depending on the person .

get out , or do n't act so interested .

what is the size of an average penis and the depth of a vagina ?
first of all - black men are not `` larger '' than any other men .
it is a myth .
i know people who 've had small black _UNK , and had asians who had big meat .
so what !
average size _UNK is about 5 or 6 inches .
average size erect is near 9 , but men all have different sizes when erect .
some are tiny and then become huge when erect .
as for the vagina - women have different depth inside .
less than 10 inches to reach her _UNK .

when your a gurl and your a teenager do boyz just use you for u know having sex with you ?
which is stronger ?
`` love '' or `` like '' and whats the difference ?
i disagree with some of these answers .
i think `` like '' is the one that yells it out and `` love '' is more quiet .
like is that first feeling when youre _UNK and sometimes obsessed with someone .
real love doesnt happen at first sight , or on one romantic night , it _UNK in slowly over the years and is stable and secure .
all the butterflies and kisses in the rain , thats just to make movies more interesting .
is it normal if you are married to be in your mind only attracted to someone else .
you are not going to have a relationship but it is in your mind only .
you are not even sure if the person you are attracted to knows it .
would he sense it and if he does even though you are not trying to have a relationship would he disrespect you .
as long as youre still attracted to your spouse i dont see why it has to be a problem .
everyone gets turned on by others after they 're married , its not just you !

because it is so wonderful .
your heart expands so that it can feel more .

hope i answered your question enough to help

take her dates .
send her flowers .
do things together .
try to _UNK her desire .

parent help ?
my dad is soo over protective .
_UNK your daughter did this what would you do ?
i know you might be different from my dad but i think its my choice and just wanted to hear some opinions ?
it 's not your choice if he carried insurance on you .
belly button piercings get infected very easily and that will mean a trip to the doctor and medication .
its not fair to put that on your parents when they said no to begin with .
if my daughter came home with it done anyway she would have to remove it and then be grounded ... at least .
when you have your own job and insurance then by all means , have at it .
pierce whatever you want .

female , male !
how can i win a girls heart who is already in love with someone other ?
computer professional .
if she is truely in love with another , the best you can do is be her friend .

just be there and be a friend to her .

i have a similar situation .
my ex agrees that our son has attention problems but does n't agree he should be medicated .
you have several options , one have your ex meet with your child 's teachers and have him go along to the next doctor appointment .
that is what i did .
my ex wanted to feel like he was being heard and that his opinion _UNK .
second , you could take your child to a different doctor for a second opinion , one of your ex choosing and get the diagnosis confirmed .
third , ignore the ex .
most kids do n't take add meds on weekends anyways .
just make sure he has it for school and that your ex knows he takes it on school days .
good luck

how do you now when the right time to say _UNK u is ?
expressing your emotions this way will just make the other person disregard your opinion right off the bat .
use different approach , avoid and ignore .

is there anyway to be romantic even after i moved ?
she 15 , i 'm 16 i live in northern oregon and she lives in southern california .
i moved right after she said she would be my girlfriend .
and my dad kind of screwed me over by telling me the next day that we were moving .
so i didnt get to do much before i moved .
i still love her and she loves me .
but i 'm still very new at the whole dating thing and its even harder with a long distance realtionship .
so does anybody have any ideas of how i can be romantic even over about 500 miles away .
she isnt much of a material girl and dosent like me spending lots of money on her so i dont really know wat to get her .
well it really dose n't take much to make some girls happy .
just keep in touch with her and send her different little gifts when she least expect it .
help i 'm confused ?
ok , this girl and i eat lunch every wednesday and we talk almost everyday .
the other day she told me she expected me to get her a small gift for her birthday , her birthday is tomorrow .

she calls me her facebook stalker , because we talk on there also .
she also has stated that we should take a class next semester .
she also has a boyfriend .
nothing else needs to be said .
good luck , and _UNK !

women are hot .
hot hot hot hot hot .
women have always been more _UNK to each other .
it is accepted if two women are touchy and _UNK with each other its never questioned .
guys are not naturally physically close with other men .
no touching , no way .

so they get closer and closer then slap !

what does the preacher say when people are getting married ?
i take my date to a _UNK , she wears a short skirt , should i try to move my hand under her skirt ?
only if you want to .
just kidding , of course .
my opinion ?
before you start making out with her ... no .
after you start making out with her and you 're at least ten minutes into it ... yes !
you bet !
if she does n't want you there , she 'll let you know one way or the other .
by the way , when i was growing up , getting under a girl 's skirt was considered third base .
and i think we all know that you do n't go directly from the batter 's box directly to third base .
it 's against the rules !
you start from the top and work your way down ... slowly , ever so slowly .
to _UNK : you 're cute !
do siblings have rights to see their step brother , just a marriage gone bad , _UNK is bitter mom left .
the _UNK mom has out of state visitation .
the _UNK father is not allowing the 11 year old brother to see his siblings as in 2 older sisters and older brother .
they have brainwashed their brother into not calling and will not let him see his sisters or brother to spend time with them after 6 years of being together .

am sure you 'll find something useful .
by the way , as no one is _UNK your question give my answer , the best answer .

if you still have contact info try calling ( but block id in case their screening your call . )
this 'll catch em off guard and ha no choice but to talk to u .
why _UNK tell everybody our business .
when we have an _UNK he have to get people _UNK .
when most people do that , they are trying to find people who will side with them to prove they are in the right .
it makes him feel good for others to say `` man , you were right , she 's wrong '' .
i bet he would n't tell people if those people sided with you everytime yall fight .
he 'd get tired of hearing he was wrong .

and he make _UNK happy alot ?
there 's this guy ... ?
she is just doing that because she is scared .
she is scared that if you date her brother she will be left out cause you two will probably spend all your free time with each other .
so my advice to you is to go out with him , but remember to make time for your friend .

and why ?

im having issues telling the guy i like , that i really like him ... ..what do i _UNK !
why men like to sleep with them self ?
i touch myself because it feels good , relieves physical and mental tension , and helps me exhaust my body before i go to sleep !
do girls like guys who play sports ?
i wrestle and i was wondering if girls like guys who wrestle or just do any sport ?
what 's the best brand condom and why ?

it 's safe and it does n't have latex smell !
o.k there is this guy i'v known him forever ( 2 years ) and know i want to go out with him what should ii do ?
and what should i do so he likes me back ?
( it took him 2 months to talk to me again ) just ask him out .
having others do it for you is a sign that you dont have the confidence to talk to him about personal things .
and if a relationship _UNK you probably wont be able to talk to open _UNK about things
hey !

give me some advice on what i should do ?
ive liked this boy since last year and he kissed one of my bestfriends but im not sure if he ever liked me .
the only reason he kissed my friend was because she had a bigger butt and was kinda fast .
but we always fight not for real though just to play around and little flirting things like that .
so what should i do ?
should i just move on or wait until i actually think he likes me .
i mean there are other guys out there too .
move on .
learn more about guys by being with some other ones .
you may find one you like better than this guy .
and who knows , as you get more mature and more confident around guys , this one might `` _UNK '' you .
have fun and good luck !
should i dump my boyfriend if he is being a jerk to everyone but me ?
probably .
eventually he 'll be a jerk to you , too .
why would you want to be with someone who is a jerk to everyone , anyway ?
do n't you want a social life ?
do n't you want your friends and family around ?
he could be a controlling person who wants you all to himself , so he tries to drive everyone else away .
i 'd avoid him like he was poison ... because he is .
have u ever told someone u loved them and not really known it was true ?
yes , and it was wrong to do so .
i 've never told a girl i love them , to get sex -- never .
but i have responded to an i love your , by saying i love her back .
it still is n't right , as women are definitely more emotionally tied to a guy they are having sex with .
but life is a some of your experiences , and sometimes you make bad decisions , and if your smart , you learn from them .
he left me when i was pregnant and went and married someone else and had _UNK please ?
men are out to get one thing and that is sex , and he does not care about the factors of your feelings or respect .
if women just say no , and stop making it so easy for men to robbed us from our bodies and etc .
we wil get more respect then we got .
unfortunately to many women are not using thier brains , and keeping the legs close and just say and mean no !
you were used , just like so many other women .
do n't make it easy for a man to use you just for sex !

your friend should n't worried about what the other kids say about him .
you are the only one that cares and loves him .
he may be different from the other kids and you have to show them that he is special .
he is a kind and gentle person .
you have to show him that or he 'll really kill himself .
talk to him and show him how you love him .
talking to him will change his mind .
good luck !

do you think an unmarried couple who have been together for _UNK .
should ( if they want ) have a child ?
this is more of a moral question for me .
yes .
it 's not that difficult .

to be _UNK ' married does not require that much of an effort or expense .
so if they 're committed to being long term partners , why not get married before bringing a child into this world ?

me and my boyfriend have been living together for over a year now and he just recently started telling me he loves me .
i am just _UNK as to why it takes a guy so long to say it and when it takes him that long does he really mean it ?
he doesnt tell me everyday but when he does say it i melt .
he surprises me and tells me when i am not expecting it at all .
i love this guy and he knows how much i love him i just want to know he loves me to .
if you ate steak all day everyday how precious would steak be to you after a week ?
that feeling you get when he tells you he loves you sounds to me like he 's doing it right .
i 'm 20 yrs old , a 31 yrs old guy likes me !
i think i like him too ?
he is good looking and a very nice guy , i 'm not sure if should date him ot not ?
just be careful ... ...
how do you know if you 're in love ?
when you know everything about them no matter if its good or bad and you wouldnt change them you want them just the way they are ... .
when you would do anything for them even if it mean jumping in _UNK of a train to push them out of the way ... .
when you miss them so much you start to cry before theyre even gone ... .
when you cant picture them out of your life ever ... .
when you want to do things for them just to see a smile on their face ... .
then you know your in love ... .
and that person is truly special and you should never let them go ... .. _UNK

possibly , but as long as that double standard exists , nobody is talking about it ...
do i love him ?
he loves me very much , everybody tells me that i love him but i don`t know , how can i understand that ?
how do you feel , when you 're infront of him ?
ever notice how different you feel when you 're with him , than when with someone else , or alone ?

my guess is , yes , you love him .

hes the nicest guy ive ever met and i can really be myself around _UNK ... but he smokes soo much !

only you can decide if you 'll accept the behavior or walk away .
this is not anything against you - the guy simply likes getting high !

or is it just me ?
i read this book called the five love languages by gary _UNK .
i talks about the five different ways people express love to each other .
the ones i can remember , are time , gifts , words .
the last two i ca n't remember .
i know that i usually express my love by giving people gifts , it 's just natural for me , if i like somebody , i give them something .
for others , what they say matters more than what they give , or for others thier time is more valuable than words or gifts .
so look for the way that your loved ones see love expressed and try to show it to them in that way .

girls likes ?
tell me what is the best features you like about the opposite sex .
for the guys is it the girls bottom , breast , lips , hips ... .

without being a _UNK , while you are busy ?
i get asked out all the time .
i am a hottie
what did he see in her ?
a guy friend is telling me about his girl in his class .
she does n't talk much , but she smiles a lot , kinda pretty and a little chubby .
he said they always look at each other 's eyes and just smile .
he asked her out but she said she was busy .
but my friend said he 's not giving up yet .
what do you think he saw in her that made him want to date her ?
is it just because she 's like a challenge to him because he would n't go out with him ?
do guys really like shy girls ?
when people want something badly enough , they do n't give up ... trust me on that .
maybe he just likes her too much , he has his reasons though , i 'm sure .

every guy likes her , what does she have that i do n't ?
she 's blonde , but why do _UNK like her ?
thats a good question .
a better question would be : why should you compare yourself to her ?
i bet your attract your fair share of guys , but you simply dont know it .
the girl jessica is probably very _UNK at dealing with people , and that isnt something we are all good at .

depending on your state , the date of separation can be important as far as responsibility for bills , and assets .
if you were separated on jan 1st , and opened a charge account in feb , your partner probably would n't have to pay any part of that .
an attorney would be able to give you the exact laws for your situation .

all the best .

but i could be wrong and the law has already been changed .

all business will be conducted in english _UNK compelling circumstances . ''

really , he knows their there .
and they are a growing group .
and they have asked for a meeting with him .

this should be a slam dunk .
do you think torture is acceptable ?
no .
how do people stray from that ?
do they not have an education ?

how ?
how is the percentage of people who think torture is okay not the same as the percentage of people who think the earth is round ?
i try to teach my children to `` treat others as you want them to treat you , not the way that they do treat you '' .
as far as i am concerned , two negatives only make a positive in math .

those who think that is acceptable are completely barbaric and would surely change their minds once they have been tortured .

no !
we should n't support illegals .
this is a very complex issue because there are very good pro 's & con 's .

example , i have a friend that work as a _UNK for a national hotel chain .
she works 6 days a week 10-12 hours a day .
she gets paid more than minimum wage but less than $ 10 an hour and she has had this job for more than 10 years .
i believe that america should take care of our own first but by no means ignore the rest of the world .

a fire at a hospital full of patients will have higher priority than a fire an an empty warehouse .
each case is different .

personally , i would go with germany , despite the high labor costs .
though i do n't know much about the _UNK countries or australia .

india has simply had very little _UNK and never had the capital it needs to build it .
ironically , this lack of _UNK may now be an advantage because they can build _UNK from the ground up while learning from the mistakes of others .

a question to the illegal immigrants .
why do you think the americans do not like you ?
how would you call a person who _UNK into your house without your _UNK and what would you do in this case ?
would you call to the police or give the _UNK a bed to sleep on , food to eat or maybe a job ?

how would you treat them ?

someone tell me about welfare to work _UNK ?
all of the us states run welfare programs .
each state has their own rules .
if you are able to work and qualify for welfare , you collect welfare while you are looking or training for employment .
the welfare payments are limited to two years in my state .
some people can not work and have never worked , so they do not qualify for social security .
say a person is blind and confined to a wheel chair .
that person will never be able to work , so he is entitled to welfare for as long as he lives , or until state laws change .
how many recognized political parties in world ?
it 's hard to say .
it depends what the criteria is for something to be considered a political party .
and then there might be instances where two different parties go by the same name .

for example , in the united states , there are numerous socialist parties .
would you group them all together or count them individually ?
the millennium goals ?
hoax or reality ?
is the united nations truly inclined to help the _UNK poverty ?

i think i remember hearing about a federal regulation that prohibits individual states from requiring the use of original ( _UNK ) parts for automotive repairs .
can anybody point me in the right direction as to where i can find this ?
thanks .
that is clearly something that each state should be able to decide for itself .
they would have to make an extremely hard case for it being an interstate commerce issue , and without that , it 's definitely unconstitutional .

is n't there 1 law for the rich and another for the poor ?
to me its obvious that the law was written by the rich , for the rich .

sometimes i think there are no laws for the rich but many for the poor
if you do n't vote , do you think you have the right to criticize the government and politicians ?

what did you make of the whole terry _UNK situation ?
i would say that poor , poor woman except that she was for all _UNK and purposes dead while all that crap was _UNK around her .

apartment in seattle ?

they 'd have to do a background check , and even then , you 're probably ok .
it 's when you get a felony that your options in life become extremely limited .
you can buy a gun in many states with a misdemeanor , so you 're probably worrying a little too much when it comes to being a _UNK .
heck , many landlords go by a credit check now anyway and would n't even be checking your record .
why would the supreme court make a seemingly stupid decision about _UNK domain , taking property from ... .
a private land owner and giving it to a private corporation .

the govt .

increasing a tax base is a legitimate state interest .
which countries are not better to live at than the u.s. ?
not better for a short list there are many countries which are not better to live in than the us .
maybe it would be easier to ask which ones are better .
in this case i would say the _UNK countries , holland , switzerland , luxembourg , canada undoubtedly .
maybe some other european nations too , but this could be _UNK .
there are many good things about america too , but people who insist that it is the best have obviously not traveled much .

the _UNK there is unbelievable and there is almost always a surplus of money .
the virginia state government never takes that money to help us poorer counties .
its almost if we dont exist .

should racial profiling be an _UNK method of police tactics ?
if you were con what would be your thoughts on this topic .
no , but not because of why you might think .
when you profile something , you tend to miss those that do n't fit the profile .
just like any other problem that you are trying to solve , you must approach it with an open mind or you will make mistakes .
i want law enforcement to catch all terrorists , not just the ones that fit the profile .
all law enforcement should be done with an open and fair mind to protect us all .

i do n't think he should have been stopped in the middle but i do think he should n't be invited back .

i think laws should be for one purpose .

it 's getting crazy .
i agree too and i am largely a libertarian which i guess you are too .

if someone was diagnosed with a terminal illness , should that person ( _UNK ) have the right to choose the end his / her own life ?
in oregon and the netherlands , there is this thing called `` assisted suicide '' .
in those 2 places , the person has this choice to ask a doctor for a pill .
then he/she takes the pill that will kill him/her .
it is `` assisted suicide '' because the doctor assists the patient to suicide by giving that patient a prescription of a `` death pill . ''
i actually think that a person should not have the right to end his/her life .
why ?
because when people are ill they can feel like they want to die at that moment .
but if they did not give up and survived , later on , they would realize that they were glad that they did not die .
so , my answer would be no .
what does `` criminal summons issued '' mean ?
it is an order by the court of jurisdiction to appear before that court at the date and time specified .
it is sent instead of having a law enforcement officer arrest you .
by showing up as ordered it will look better for you and will save you a day or two in the county jail .
however , if you fail to appear an arrest warrant will be issued and you will go to jail , possibly needing a bail bond to get released .
suggestion ... ... _UNK up !
do dems need to provide a solution to bush 's invasion of iraq ?
is it the dems responsibility to fix the intentional `` mistake '' , or is it _UNK that they do in congress .
ultimately all they can do is advise ... the president is still the _UNK ( commander in chief ) so look for little to change other than casualties rising .

how to get _UNK cards from the president ?
should bill clinton be allowed to be un secretary general ?
also , consider the fact that his wife wants to be the president of the us .
is this too much power for one family to have ?
hell no !
we do not need another _UNK in the u.n. !
the u.n. is a worthless organization that just leeches off the u.s. !
they should be kicked out of our country !

how can i get a restraining order in illinois ?
it should be available at your local courthouse .
you can ask for an injunction against harrassment .
please file police reports whenever she does it .
once the injunction has been issued , she will not be able to continue this harrassment .
if she does , contact the police immediately .
is bill clinton smarter than george w bush coz both were born in 1946 but clinton became the p first ?
neutral answers + bush had a greater parental background than clinton no , clinton is not smarter than bush because he became president first .
he is smarter than bush because he actually made use of his brain and have an intellectual curiosity that bush does not have or care for .
he actually reads the stuff the intelligence community gives him and ask intelligent questions , unlike bush who takes every word that is fed to him as gospel .
