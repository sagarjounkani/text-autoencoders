husband loves the thin crust pizza .
breadsticks are great too
monicals pizza is by far one of my favorite pizzas .
the traditional thin crust topped with sausage and pinnaple it where its at .
i also like this location .
it has two levels which gives is a more homey feeeling .
and more unbelievably the pizza served was missing a portion .
the reason ?
`` the oven ate it '' - according to the waitress .
absolutely love their thin crust pizzas .
have n't found one as crispy anywhere else .
slow service and bad food .
the pizza is just ok .
the appetizers are frozen and low quality .
service is always slow and they constantly forget basic things like straws .
the family environment is nice for kids or big groups .
ok pizza .
i 've ate here many times after # illini football games .
service is great & fast .
reasonably priced .
accept credit .
i suggest the family meal .
_num_ pizzas , _num_ family salad & _num_ pitcher of soda .
three thumbs up !
_num_ wok a try .
i am glad we did .
i suggest the chow fun .
it 's very good and not too greasy ...
cheap and perfectly adequate .
the kind of place you order from because it 's close and cheap .
mmm .
the food here is n't great but it is n't bad either .
among the cheaper options though , this is about par .
i really think this is some of the best chinese food in champaign .
i love this place for take out chinese .
when i get other things i am happy with the food .
the price match the quantity ...
not at number one .
every time i order it comes exactly as expected and exceeds taste wise .
the fried dumplings are a must if you ever visit this place .
could n't be more happy with their service either .
i order for pick up and it 's always ready right on time .
perfect .
food is actually pretty delicious .
price is okay , but the amount that they give you is amazing .
definitely worth going for if you want good quick chinese food
the biggest serving of crab rangoon my lonely eyes have ever seen .
they could use a fork upgrade , but the rice was nice .
i got the garlic chicken with vegetables with lo mein .
paid over $ _num_ and it was pretty greasy and just very underwhelming .
# _num_ wok !
; d
we just are n't too adventurous , so .
you really ca n't do those things wrong .
well , you ca n't do them wrong easily .
there were only two better , and sadly , they 've long since closed .
for a fair price , head on in !
total date night , right there in a strip mall .
good times ... good times .
and good food for sure !
teej is from southern california .
teej is afraid of the cold .
teej is in desperate need of winter clothes .
teej also speaks in third person .
i walked in and briefly fingered coats , feeling lost and confused .
`` have you spent a winter here before ? ''
she asked , eyeing my confused expression .
`` uh ... no , '' i admitted .
`` i just moved here from southern california .
`` where are you from ! ? ''
she demanded instantly .
`` i 'm from the south bay . ''
`` me too ! ''
i shouted .
then we got down to coat-shopping .
definitely check out champaign surplus .
they rule !
i am a comparison shopper .
i check prices , models and when i spend my money i spend deliberately .
i also try to buy locally .
checked champaign surplus and the price was exactly the same !
score !
i can get them instantly and try them on !
so i took the _num_ 's .
boo .
i lost my receipt .
boo .
this is why we should all shop locally .
service like this wo n't be found at a chain store or online .
here 's why champaign surplus rocks
service and selection .
prior to this they were a north face , mountain hardwear , patagonia mill .
its better than wildcountry , but those are really two different stores .
do n't miss their sidewalk sale !
kudos to ira and co
champaign surplus is a great store .
what a pleasant surprise this store was !
this is the better of the two local outdoor/outfitter stores in town .
in the back is their army-surplus store .
the sale is a great place to get gloves/mittens/hats , too .
or an electronic kiosk or something along those lines .
this is for sure the best place to go for your outdoor/winter clothes needs .
they have a nice selection of stuff and the prices seem just about right .
their camping and sporting stuff is pretty aweosme too .
definitely a fan !
( wtf )
so that makes the price difference more palatable , especially if you need help .
this is a nice store : lots of great brands and selection .
prices reflect the good brands -- do n't expect a bargain .
i was also hoping that as a surplus store they 'd carry more gear .
they have some , but very limited in type and variety .
the focus here is on clothing .
an institution , but has come so far since i was a kid .
they 're now a mini rei , both in size/selection and quality .
prices too , really , but i 'm used to inflated prices .
hubby found a cute cap here for our upcoming cold-weather trip .
good quality and good service once you find someone to help .
for our area this is a good military surplus store .
they carry abig line of domestic & international military clothing & gear .
they also carry fort knox & alpha jackets and coats .
went there today .
good service and some good tips .
by the foot , a modest selection of buckles/cord locks etc .
) .
on the internet there are no blank stares ...
this store is always well-stocked and well-staffed .
this store is dangerous for people who like camping gadgets .
i am one of those people .
really ? )
i will forgive them for this because they have all the smartwool .
all of it .
a fantastic local supply store for explorers and outdoor adventurers .
came here with my boyfriend to get some new hiking shoes .
sometimes if you 're just shopping during a sale , they can be annoying .
do n't forget to check the back room for the best deals !
also , do n't come here expecting actual military surplus .
they charge extra for bags so do n't forget to bring your own !
i 've been shopping at champaign surplus since _num_ .
i told him i was n't in the habit of saving receipts for socks .
he told me he could n't exchange them .
that said , there are some excellent ones too .
this place has a fun dance atmosphere .
i remember driving to champaign from kankakee to go to `` c street '' .
it was worth the drive .
when it is warm , you can hang out on the patio as well .
c street is where the boys are in champaign .
they also have free popcorn .
i 'll have to check it out again on a busier night .
weird , weird and more weird !
this bar is pure vintage .
chester street is where my club life began .
the dance floor is massive with a giant mirror in the back .
c/u is a fun town period .
this bar is what you make out of it .
music is fun and meeting people there is memorable .
drag show is recommendable .
parking is close and fairly big .
bathrooms are not good , and the cover is a bummer .
floor / counter tops can be sloshing with alcoholic liquid though ...
this is usually the last stop of the night whenever i go out .
hands down this place has the best hot nachos in the city !
_num_ .
bazooka bubblegum martini
_num_ .
bahama mama
_num_ .
tanning bed
_num_ .
summer in a glass
_num_ .
flirty blue hawaii
they play the best edm in the champaign .
parking is relatively easy .
there 's always parking in the rear .
what is this magical place you call c street ?
i used to be afraid of this place as a closed-minded junior .
but i gave it a shot one day and wow .
c street has the best dj 's and dance floor on/near campus .
ps .
it 's usually fine .
the bartender , andrew is a bit chatty but nice .
today i go in the bf is tending bar .
decides he is gon na be a jerk ; no manners .
i leave .
must be rolling in the tips too .
anyway , plenty of other bars that would be happy to have my money .
cheers !
the drag shows are awesome and the music is usually great for dancing .
the drinks are good , and the beer selection is okay .
overall it 's a cool place with a great vibe .
if i were closer i would probably go more often .
hey c-street .
i was really looking forward to hearing alexander spin some spooky music last night .
i know how this is supposed to work !
packed .
lovely .
the bar is full and the drinks are strong .
the music is loud and the people are ... well..cute .
lol or usually not .
but that 's just me .
clean the floors .
remodel the bathrooms .
keep on gettin it with the drag shows .
i 'm a fan of the drag shows every sunday night .
the bartender was amazing .
it made my night .
the show area was cool too .
the sound was great , the artist was better .
i danced my butt off , and i had a blast .
yo floors sticky
additionally , modern bars are offering more than two draught selections .
overall , i 'm extremely happy !
i 've been going to dr. albert 's office for the last few years .
i am always extremely impressed by the thoroughness and efficiency of her exams .
she is very friendly , helpful , and open to any questions .
all of my appointments have lasted around 30-40 minutes .
i really appreciate doctors who respect my time !
i 'm surprised there are n't more reviews of dr. albert here .
she discovered that i had prism , which was the cause of my headache .
i went to illini eye care before but they did not test for that .
they are great at helping to find a flattering and fashionable pair of glasses .
i love this place !
they have a good selection of frames incl .
some very unique ones .
dr. albert is great too and provides very thorough exams .
highly recommend .
what really brings me back , though , is the great staff there .
yes , linda ! !
she 'll just bring me several frames , and then the fun begins .
i have really appreciated that .
for such a small shop , they can be busy .
for an eye exam , of course you need an appointment .
but for adjustments , you can 'walk in . ''
they are definitely work the wait !
highly recommended .
dr jodi is a really nice optometrist .
i 'm not sure if that was on purpose or by accident ...
i am in cu for graduate school and needed new glasses and an exam .
i have to say that i was impressed .
still , i found frames that i really liked and i 'm pretty picky .
in a medical office !
wonderful products , wonderful service !
love eddie bauer products , high quality outdoor wear .
you should definitely pop by .
good products , but very , very limited selection compared to their catalog .
i am always surprised that they generate enough income to pay the rent .
but here 's my beef ...
it has gotten to the point that i hate to go into the store .
to which i answered `` do n't worry about it . ''
to which , i said nothing ... but thought plenty
i probably do not want to have a conversation with you about anything .
please shut the f*** up and leave me the f*** alone .
same old , same old ... verbally assaulted by 20-something clerk ...
no , i do not need your assistance .
no , i do not want to discuss my weekend plans with you .
no , i do n't care anything about you or your life .
very friendly service .
i went to do-it-best today for the first time .
i expected do-it-best to be small , stuffy , and overpriced .
i was wrong !
this is my go-to hardware store .
i can get in and out in a short amount of time .
what really sets this store apart from other hardware stores is their employees .
they have quality items and are always happy to help .
that said , i always find what i need .
they have expanded a little with garden tool rentals .
their prices are not far off the big box stores .
this is almost worth a trip to champaign .
so well stocked , i 've never seen a better collection .
low-keyed , extraordinarily well stocked , highly organized , very clean , good prices .
thought it was just a paint store from the signage .
pleasant surprise .
this is my go-to hardware store .
the employees are very helpful and knowledgeable .
there is a huge difference between shopping here and somewhere like menards/lowes .
they provide a _num_ % discount if you show your icard !
the hip , go-to hair salon .
and i think that says something ...
love this place !
i love rebecca !
i love amy !
i love lindsey !
i love jake !
the whole staff is rad and i 'll never go anywhere else .
i 'd definitely recommend it , especially if you want something more edgy/funky .
they 'll take good care of you and make sure you 're happy !
i 'm not suburban-bland , but i 'm not a hipster either .
so best of luck to them , but i 've decamped .
but the more i went , the less they seemed to want me there .
it 's champaign-urbana for crissakes -- do we have to be so pretentious ?
recently i found myself in a bit of a hair rut .
step in : abby from ippatsu .
thank you , abby !
i have one the best haircuts ever !
i just love it !
plus a bonus is that shes so sweet !
they are the best place to get a haircut , color , etc .
even if you like contemporary to unique , they got it down .
everyone who works there is very sweet and genuine too !
i 'm gon na miss this place so much when i move : (
but maybe i 'm pretty easy going so that 's just my preference .
i was a little bit worried because i saw his hands shaking a bit ?
but i think that 's just how he is .
at the end , i was very pleased with my hair .
i think she 's the owner 's dog .
it was a nice distraction to have around : )
when i walked in for my appointment i was a little surprised .
the staff seems pretty young ( most under _num_ ?
) , but very nice .
someone immediately took my coat and amy introduced herself right away .
she decided on color and went to work .
i love the cut and color and will definitely go back .
and yes , roxie , the chihuahua , is adorable !
both times , it was doug .
i pictured myself ending up with a mohawk , or a gigantic japanese-style quiff .
my only quibble is the cost .
i 'll probably go here again next time i feel like splurging though .
i recently moved to chicago after graduating from u of i this spring .
i have never felt so comfortable with someone cutting my hair !
( though i know their other stylists are awesome as well ! )
i just got out of my hair appointment about _num_ min .
ago , and i could n't be happier .
my stylist was amy , who was very friendly , relaxed , and confident .
if you 're looking for a new salon , go to ippatsu .
i loooove the place .
friendly staff , warm atmosphere , excellent service .
i see kate when i go there , and she does really stylish haircuts .
i myself am very indecisive about what to do with my hair .
the place has not match in cu .
i am a far cry from being scene .
they were always happy to have me there .
i do n't think it exists in champaign .
service :
ippatsu has young staff who like to express themselves .
quality of work :
*i have never dyed my hair here , only had hair cuts .
i wish she were more gentle with her hands .
price :
costly .
jake is great !
i was pretty nervous about it , but am quite pleased with the outcome .
he took his time cutting it and was very thorough .
i have curly hair that i wear both curly and straight .
i definitely recommend him to people of all hair types .
he also has some kind of certification in cutting curly hair .
ippatsu is as close as i 've found to that experience .
she also does a great cut and style .
i have major cow licks and i come out with poker straight hair .
i 've been so impressed i 'm using ippatsu for my wedding !
ippatsu rocks my face off .
rebecca is the stuff dreams are made of .
period .
many people complain that the environment and staff in ippatsu seem pretentious .
i 'm new to the area and decided to give ippatsu a try .
ok , i can take partial responsibility for being late , but _num_ minutes ?
really ?
and the bad service i experienced will keep me from coming back .
i 've had difficulty finding someone who could cut long curly hair .
jake was amazing , skilled and friendly .
i was impressed and readily recommended the salon to everyone i knew .
not to mention , my hair was cut after it was dried and curled .
i 've learned cutting curly hair dry is almost always a disaster .
i was throughly disappointed .
i will not be returning here .
jake was the person that cut my hair and he was awesome .
the salon is very different but i liked ! ! .
lol !
!
quit being cheap people and get a good hair cut !
!
just got my devacut with doug last week .
and of course , doug is awesome .
he recommended products without being a salesman and i love everything i bought .
the deva curl one condition is amazing .
we ended my cut with a hug .
wherever doug is , that 's where i 'll go .
but i really like ippatsu .
plus , it 's right downtown next to some tasty cafes and bakeries .
doug is my hero !
i 'd resigned myself to looking horrible forever .
i look forward to our visits - very fun & relaxed .
much more down-to-earth than one might expect from the downtown vibe .
plus , the price is incredibly reasonable for such a high-quality cut !
!
he has earned my highest recommendation !
avoid at all costs ! ! !
doug ended up completely butchering my hair .
also , the salon was a sauna !
the other stylists stared and awkwardly eavesdropped while i was getting my hair cut .
overall , it was a really horrible experience .
kate cut my curly hair and completely , utterly butchered it .
it literally was meant to destroy my appearance .
awful , amateur job .
dealing with ippatsu was a joy from start to finish !
doug was wonderful .
the results are subtle , just what i wanted .
i brought along a bag of the products i use .
doug spent 1-1/2 hours with me .
i love how unique , artsy , and friendly they are .
i will definitely be returning to ippatsu and jamie for haircuts !
!
p.s .
do n't forget that they 've moved to their new location on chester !
: )
in truth , the experience was great !
jake is super nice and approachable as other reviews mentioned .
he seemed very knowledgable .
my hair looks great , has nice volume and frames my face better .
most importantly , it works with and accentuates my naturally curly hair .
if you have curly hair , i absolutely recommend the devacut .
if you can get it with jake at ippatsu even better .
it 's seriously one of the best hair cuts i have ever had .
p.s .
i hate to spend money -- especially on haircuts .
i believe the extra expense if worth every penny .
i love getting my hair cut here !
jamie marlow is the world 's best hairstylist .
there is no one i would rather go to .
she does exactly what you want and works with you and your hair .
she makes it work .
jamie listens , cares , and is just the best .
i 've never had better hair .
without a doubt , the very best salon in c-u .
i 've tried other salons in the area and always regretted it .
rebecca is an outstanding owner and artist .
kate , my stylist , is simply outstanding .
it wo n't happen again , ippatsu !
i can not say enough about how great my experience was here .
jake was these two things combined .
jake is great for a number of reasons .
) .
also , tis place is absolutely not at all whatsoever overpriced .
ca n't say a bad word about the folks at ippatsu .
but i finally found it !
i love my new hair cut !
amy did an amazing job !
she 's nice and friendly and was able to give me a beautiful trim .
i 'll definitely be going back .
i really enjoyed my overall experience at ippatsu salon .
the salon has an overall trendy vibe .
i liked the decoration and water was available in the waiting area .
it was a comfortable temperature and was a pleasant place to be .
i got there a bit early and my appointment started on time .
amy was friendly and seemed very knowledgable .
if you need a curly cut , see jake !
he 's a master in his field !
big city style and experience for a small town price !
i went from a dark blonde to auburn and i absolutely love it !
johnathon was friendly , enthusiastic , and did a fantastic job !
i would highly recommend johnathon and ippatsu to anyone who asks !
yes , it 's pricey but it 's well worth it !
i will definitely be back !
seriously !
does it get any better than that ?
nope .
it does n't .
oh , and ( most importantly ) they 're good at what they do .
: - )
i saw amy for a hair cut .
i had long curly hair that was weighed down and damaged .
i would say it is the best haircut i have ever had !
so so happy !
the environment is inviting and friendly .
i recommend this salon .
he is fairly easy-going and caring your thoughts and concerns .
thanks jake to make my hair survive = )
jake jake jake !
i love this salon .
amy is fabulous !
go see her .
she listens and gave me the look i was going for .
this salon is a great vibe , chill and relaxed .
overall fantastic experience and i highly advise anyone to go b
i asked for a basic color service and the stylist burned my scalp .
never again .
go elsewhere !
i know no one reviews mcdonalds , but this drive through is seriously awesome .
ok so we all know that mcdonalds is awesome .
there 's nothing i can complain about .
liars !
mcdonalds is generally mcdonalds .
the food here is fine , but service/atmosphere is lacking .
also , they have very strict bbq sauce quotas .
it 's mcdonald 's .
enough said .
service can range time to time , but that 's expected with fast food .
!
i only use the drive through at this mcdonalds .
_num_ of the last _num_ times i 've been the order has been wrong .
i did n't realize either time until i got to work .
i 'm guessing they ca n't leave after work stars and neither can i .
done with this mcd 's .
it 's not much different from most other mcdonald 's .
customer service is average .
the service is horrendous .
went there numerous times and my orders have been messed up .
how do i hate thee ?
let me count the ways .
seriously .
i hate this mcdonalds .
i 'm not exaggerating .
i 'm dead serious .
i had the number one .
the coke from the fountain was fine .
after i finished the meal ,
thank goodness for mcdonalds .
this is why america is awesome .
my first mcdonald when i got to america .
the playground smells horrible .
the worst quality mcdonald i have been to .
my mcchicken only comes with one slice of bun ... ... ...
the other side is missing .
terrible service and management .
never again .
this is a terrible place for anybody looking to enjoy themselves .
if having fun is not your thing , check out fat city .
inside , the place does n't *look* that bad .
the second time i went was a tuesday night .
so the service was great , right ?
nope .
the worst i 've experienced in champaign-urbana .
drinks took literally _num_ minutes .
those three drinks will cost you $ _num_ plus 20-35 minutes of your life .
the music system sucks .
) .
the food sucks .
on tuesday , they have $ _num_ margaritas that are terrible .
) .
then my buddy got his blue moon draft in a plastic cup .
went here wednesday night with a friend .
they have $ _num_ domestic beers on wednesday night .
we sat outside and the outside area is really nice .
we ordered the nachos and my friend really liked them .
overall it was a nice place to sit outside and visit with friends .
it was not crowded at all .
i went for the dollar beer again and met a friend for dinner .
i had the grilled chicken buffalo wrap .
the homemade potato chips that they served with the wrap were excellent .
lots of memories at this dive , and a place for townies mostly .
this place has been through several owners ( one being my cousins ) .
a beer garden that has hosted plenty of bands .
anybody from the boat drunks to tons of fun band .
plenty of tv 's that put a premium on illini sports .
i will always remember watching the illinois/arizona ncaa game during the 04-05 season here .
always a fun time .
she was always polite and very conscious of any discomfort .
never heard or experienced any thing like that before .
will not be going back ...
worse cleaning i have ever had .
the crow they said would cost _num_ .
i went here for their new customer cleaning discount .
i made the appointment last week .
i showed up _num_ minutes before my 2:00 o'clock appointment as requested .
i left .
i have never seen such colossal unprofessionalism .
judging by the other reviews here , i clearly dodged a bullet .
good to see .
did n't see any old lady maybe that 's why .
they also cooked the vegetables up fresh for you .
i was able to have a fulfilling meal and take some home for later .
not `` chinese food '' .
just same things fried in same sauce .
will never go unless iam stuck in the mall and hungry
when i go to a restaurant during prime time i expect results .
i did not get them at panda express at the mall .
after completing my order they legitimately offered me something that was unavailable .
this is my usual lunch spot when i am out shopping with my family .
it is very popular and the line is usually quite long .
i do n't know what was up , but it was very slow going .
given that the food is already prepared , does n't make much sense .
i ordered a two entree orange chicken ( my fave ) with white rice .
she asked if i wanted to wait or get something else .
being that i only drink diet soda , it meant must go without .
i got water instead .
it was kinda vinegary .
thanks , g-mart , for being the best comics shop in town .
there 's a good selection of comics here , including some small press titles .
a lot of trade paperbacks too , and some action figures .
oh , and i love their pre-ordering system .
definitely the best comic store in the area .
i love diving into quarter bins and g-mart has some of the best .
every time i head back down to champaign , i stop by g-mart .
so , let me get this straight -- i love comics .
a lot .
oh .
my .
thor .
i have missed this .
a lot .
on saturday , they had free pizza for comic book day .
and storm troopers .
and a guy dressed up as iron man .
hells to the mothereffin ' yes .
you have to search a little bit to find it these days .
they 're on-hand stock is a bit underwhelming overall .
but i 'm not sure cu could support such a store .
this is probably one of the best places to order comics .
my favorite comic book stores usually have some kind of back-issue collection .
_num_ word .
colbotron .
fortunately , no one has ever entered g-mart when goldfrapp is not playing .
alright , seriously though , colby makes the store .
_num_ stars ... i do n't have the heart to give it _num_ .
i feel kind of bad hatin ' on g-mart .
but i was disappointed when i stopped by to check it out .
then you actually enter the comic book shop .
it 's ... a lot smaller than i was expecting .
and not very densely stocked .
i noticed a few cool indie comics , including paping .
also quite a few boxes of back-issues , which are always fun to browse .
i really like trade paperbacks/graphic novels and the selection was pretty limited .
however , for anything else i would n't count on it .
one of my favorite things about going to a comic book shop is browsing .
i know this is somewhat frowned upon .
do n't read the comics and all that jazz .
or buy it directly from fantagraphics .
or drawn & quarterly .
or what ever .
why is it almost totally empty ?
so many more comics could fit into this store .
i guess i just do n't understand why the space seems so poorly utilized .
there could be so much more awesomeness going on here !
but there is n't .
boys , girls , challenged , gifted .
.
.
like comics !
!
street signage and visibility is zero .
service was laid back , friendly , and helpful .
would certainly recommend and return .
extremely friendly staff helped kids pick out a few free comic books .
kids are excited to read their comics .
we 'll be back - they just made us new customers .
i purchased a viola here in february for _num_ months same as cash .
the person argued with me and altimately refused my payment .
it 's a shame this business has gotten a few poor reviews .
my experience was different .
please support our local businesses before going online .
it is a value added service and a benefit to our local community .
whenever my boyfriend and i are in the area , we always stop in .
apparently , this place has the best prices on guitar strings - whoodathunk ! ?
i 'm no musician , but i 've had nothing but great experiences here .
get your hot pot supplies here ! ! !
i believe that they typically get their shipments in on fridays .
sometimes they even have random seafood products like littleneck clams or blue crab .
this place rocked .
i never would have known about it except through word of mouth .
bizarre fruits , strange flavors , and interesting ingredients are abundant .
asian grocery store in a super cramped building .
i do n't think they like white people .
it was kind of offensive , but whatever .
they have good , cheap produce and lots of imported canned and boxed food .
i get the feeling that they may not .
to summarize :
pros : lots of variety , relatively inexpensive
cons : dirty , can be difficult to locate what you 're looking for
this is the asians ' asian grocery store .
update : the reviews on here are for the far east grocery store .
far east grocery has a huge variety for such a little place .
as long as you are respectful to them not obnoxious .
some other customers have accused the store of being `` dirty . ''
sometimes they even have a box of live crabs available for adventurous eaters !
i describe this place to my friends as a concrete box with a door .
as far as decor goes , you should n't expect anything above that .
`` where ... where am i ?
you 're in asia , my friend .
appalling appearances aside ( awesome alliteration , amen ?
prices are reasonable but its a pain that they only accept cash or check .
recently i visited a handful of international food stores in champaign , il .
far east market was the most impressive among them .
their produce selection was incredible .
there was a variety of mushrooms .
they offer very fresh seafood .
they take both checks and cash but do not accept credit .
) .
interesting approach .
but this spot does ok .
absolutely my favorite asian market in c-u .
cash only , do n't forget !
this has got to be my favorite grocery store for asian goods .
you also get a waft of that chinese grocery store smell .
the selection of fish is pretty good .
there are many kinds of whole fish and filets .
it could be interesting fruit , seafood , packaged goodies , etc .
but the best thing of all are the owners .
they are extremely nice and helpful .
they also give good recipes and recommendations .
it 's really cozy and i feel so invited every time .
i wish i could take the store with me .
far east is very close to my sister 's apartment .
are you sure this is a safe street ? ''
my sister nodded in agreement and gave a funny look .
well , mom knows her stuff .
yes , it 's creepy from the outside .
yes , it 's a little weird smelling when you first walk in .
but the produce and authentic asian things are spot on .
i bought produce and drove it home to chicago .
that 's how good it was .
they also have all of the condiments your at-home-asian-cooking-heart desires .
let 's not even start on the candy .
yan yan .
pocky .
koala yummies .
i die .
cash only so be prepared for that .
i wish i lived in between far east and world harvest !
great place to get asian food !
i cant .
my family `` lovingly '' refers to this place as the crack house .
i refer to it disgustedly as the crack house .
i just dont trust this place .
i went in once and lasted less than _num_ minutes .
it was filthy and smelled so rotten i wanted to vomit .
let me repeat that ...
they have seafood .
in boxes .
on the floor .
should n't that shit be in a cooler or something ?
my sister went there yesterday to pick up some noodles .
what probably should have cost her $ _num_ cost her $ _num_ .
they only accept cash , probably because they make up prices as they go .
rate it _num_ because its like the only asian grocery store in town .
does n't accept cards .
can be inconvenient .
really do n't recommend to shop in this store .
lots of foods are expired and still on the shelf for sale .
i was grinning so hard when i finally made it here .
it was so funny thinking back on these reviews as i was checking out .
like , i was expecting something revolting .
too .
funny .
so yeah , it 's totally fine .
do n't let these crackers confuse you .
it has a nice asian stank in there .
oh my god .
i found my nuoc mam , chili oil , and fresh lemongrass .
they have a ton of cool sweets too .
the products in this place are reasonably priced .
so correction to my last review , you wo n't find everything you need .
that 's not the reason why i 'm giving far east _num_ stars .
i 'm not sure what is going on with that .
but that 's just for personal consumption .
there 's got to be something banning this sort of thing .
even if there is n't , this is an unsavory practice as a business .
who knows how long the meat has been left out .
i would avoid the meat .
and i would avoid the produce .
too old .
too old .
far east , you 're worrying me .
you get to keep a star for your shelf items .
check those expiration dates though .
just left the store , great employees .
produce was awesome !
got a durian today .
going back tomorrow with my husband .
lots of stuff to choose from here .
great place to get a variety of fresh authentic asian groceries .
taking a close a look at the ingredients before buying would help .
various kinds of food can satisfy my needs but the quality .
you will often buy expired food and food without expiration date .
can not imagine the poor quality of some food .
they just put expired food at the most obvious place on the shelf .
far east has a lot of chinese/asian grocery items .
i think they mostly emphasize chinese ethnic food .
the aisles are really narrow !
if you 're claustrophobic , you 've been warned !
despite some drawbacks , i will continue to come here for my grocery needs .
i saw a young lady helping another customer and asked her .
headed towards the cashier and realized i 'd left my store coupon home .
here i was , willing to spend .
hey , at least it 's way better than the target !
store review :
all around dorm/home good store .
there are some nice high end items that can be bought with good sales .
pros : large selection of home items
cons : very high prices !
hidden deals :
never anyone around to help .
easier to use amazon.com .
how times have changed .
nonetheless , i have a fat face .
not a happy girl here .
would not do again .
= )
they did n't charge for any of this either .
i ca n't comment on their other services but for .
adjustments , i was extremely satisfied .
my visit with the optometrist 's office in lenscrafters was very pleasant .
next , i stopped by their shop to select new frames .
i settled on a pair of everyday glasses and sunglasses .
i walked out of lenscrafters feeling fairly positive about the whole transaction ...
... until today .
was there something weird about the lenses ?
did they stop manufacturing the type of frames i chose ?
$ _num_ w/ tax !
pro tip : shop the return section !
great selection , same frames , $ 60+ off the price of frames !
why only _num_ stars ?
they can be busy at times .
do yourself a favor and go in the evening on a weekday .
no biggie .
unbelievable .
wo n't be doing that again !
he literally saved the day for me .
he is professional , courteous and knowledgable on lenscrafters eyewear .
the doctor side of lenscrafters gets _num_ stars .
however .
i 've found the retail side of lenscrafters to be a complete rip off .
ever wonder why glasses are ungodly expensive here ?
youtube : luxottica _num_ minutes .
now this seemed insane since my frames somehow got lenses in them inititally .
her excuse was that my frames were to `` beat up '' .
all for a fraction of the price .
i have gone to lense crafters several times .
i have always been happy with their service until recently .
my son is playing sports in the fall and will need contacts .
i scheduled an appointment , then received a call the day before the appointment .
`` we ca n't take new contact appointments after 4pm . ''
so i rescheduled the appointment for 3:20 .
again , the day before the appointment i received another call .
`` we ca n't accept new contact appointments after 2pm . ''
this time i did not reschedule .
when i asked to speak with manager , she was not taking calls .
not bad for champaign .
helpful associates .
baby clothes always on sale .
prices are high but you can find anything .
what really impressed me was the amount of starter instruments for kids .
anything you can think of , at a reasonable price .
newly remodeled and service is friendly and available .
they do n't price match .
i was told they will only price match their own webiste .
i still ca n't find anything though .
you sell the best toys.you are aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawssomeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee .
i ca n't stand this place ... . or maybe the corporation .
if you want the blu-ray ... .
forget it , that 's in another part of the store .
`` you have a coupon to buy `` peter pan '' ? ?
`` you have a coupon on your phone ?
`` target and walmart are selling `` little mermaid '' for a lower price ?
well ma'am , you have to bring the ad in to us ''
`` you have the ad on your phone ? ?
we ca n't sell you the movie if we do n't have it ''
uggggh ! ! ! !
damn you toys r us ! ! !
damn you ! ! ! ! !
!
store review :
pros : large selection of toys
cons : higher than average prices
hidden deals :
sign up for a tru credit card to earn cash back on purchases
we had our travel system picked after much research/trial .
we wasted all the time we had on that and got nothing else done .
get control of your registry people champaign toys r us !
help only if asked and get stuff right the first time !
great-tasting deep dish pizzas .
they make a mean calzone as well .
i 'm a little sad that they do n't use fresh mushrooms .
dude , this pizza is gross .
canned mushrooms ?
such a deal-breaker .
and the clumps were cold .
crust takes almost exactly like cardboard and the toppings are icky .
i ca n't imagine why anyone would order from here .
pretty smart , huh ?
too bad they would n't let me though .
so i canceled the ordered and kept on walking .
and walking .
and walking .
it 's a long way to east urbana from downtown champaign .
in the cold .
on new year 's eve .
forget the pizza here .
just forget it .
it 's not nearly as good as garcia 's or papa del 's .
in fact it 's not even better than papa john 's .
calzones .
they have fabulous calzones here .
they just ooze delicious cheese and are stuffed with toppings .
their stuffed pizza is good , but not comparable to others in town .
mind you , he had no idea what i had already paid !
this is really , really good pizza , particularly for the price .
okay , i did n't get the mushrooms .
okay , so they use canned ( or jarred ) mushrooms .
the cheese is delicious ( also had the cheesy bread ) .
but i thought the food here was terrific .
revising my earlier review .
i just had the stuffed pizza , on special for a ridiculously low price .
horrific .
and hard to recognize what i received as a stuffed pizza .
all the other reviewers seem to be rich , snobs .
it is delivery or pick-up only ... .you do n't go there for aesthetics .
this is the kind of mom & pop pizzeria pizza i grew up with .
pan is the way to go , skip the stuffed .
thumbs up on the calzones .
thumbs down on the pasta .
yuuuuuck .
something 's very wrong .
wtf ?
i made the mistake of stopping by on and ordering a pizza there .
it took like _num_ minutes ( which is to be expected ) .
i ordered a sausage and pepperoni pizza
pizza is not anything to write home about , that is for sure .
the poorboys are also good , but i really ca n't recommend the pizza .
they are lucky they have my favorite calzones in town .
this place is definitely worth stopping into if you 're a gamer .
chambananites ,
this is a local business that deserves to stay in-town .
so i can not testify for the other rpg or game types they have .
it is not to say that i have been tempted though .
everytime i come , i can not help but peruse what they have .
the staff is friendly and helpful .
did i forget to mention that there is a cat in the store ?
not a bad little shop .
lot 's of choices , lots of variety .
i can not say enough about the staff at this facility .
my story begins with picking my cat up at the groomer 's .
i was very emotional and the staff was very understanding .
they were able to set her leg and send her home very quickly .
each time we went back , they were very loving and compassionate .
have faith your pet is in good hands here .
why wo n't yelp let me give zero stars ? ! ? !
?
the animal emergency clinic of champaign is a scam .
they charge exorbitant fees and do a very poor job .
i brought my dog in after she pulled out some stitches .
very minor stuff .
the original surgery itself was n't much more than that !
but they knew they had me cornered , and they ran with it ,
they also charged just shy of $ _num_ to clean the wound ( !
) , but gave us back a dog that was covered in blood .
?
this was not by any means my first experience at the aec .
until now , i 'd been very happy with their services .
i think anyone affiliated with the aec should be ashamed of themselves .
overcharging and taking advantage of people in desperate situations is inexcusable .
they could care less about your pet .
i am glad i have pet insurance !
so caring , so patient , wonderful people and service ! !
but it is a blessing that they are there when you need them ! !
i called ahead and they were ready and waiting .
one day i thought my dog have injested something poisonous .
i found the aspca poison control number .
wonderful experience here .
she ended up needing surgery to remove her eye .
upon checkout , i received excellent discharge instructions .
they also called within the week to check on her again .
very caring and thorough care during a stressful time !
i brought my dog in who was very sick and not doing well .
is n't that what i asked !
i ca n't say enough about my vet , she is awesome and thorough .
as for animal emergency clinic , they are boobery and nothing more .
humans do n't even get charged this much for simple iv therapy !
this place is a joke to the highest magnitude !
so wonderful .
helped my guy with urine in his crystals a few months ago .
once again their friendly service came to the rescue !
circles has saved me on more than one occasion .
beautiful jewelry , yummy sweaters , and fun bags too .
she also has her own clothing line which is worth checking out .
jennifer north is way better .
how can you not love comfort and sleekness all in one ?
in a nutshell , circles = cute but utterly unaffordable .
ps : they are now on neil st , next to pekara .
it 's uncalled for , and it 's stupid .
i do n't get it .
it 's demeaning and unnecessary .
it 's not worth the visit .
bella is more professional .
i totally agree with jade .
.
.the store where she got rejected !
the clerk was staring at me like i was some kind of a kleptomaniac .
the shop was just okay for me .
love it there !
circles is a great place to find that one-of-a-kind piece .
well made fabrics , that will last many years with amazing style .
thanks circles !
definitely try it out if you have n't been before !
i love this store .
it stands alone here .
you 're better than that , girl .
literally , she spends a bar of gold on clothes for me at circles .
am i ashamed ?
that 's how i sleep at night .
in my skunkfunk fancies .
no union , no historic lincoln ... .yes super _num_ .
now , super _num_ is ... a super _num_ .
i gulped back shame as i reached for the doorknob to leave .
`` um , yeah , can you febreeze it ? ''
that night it smelled like someone had been smoking in a flowery meadow .
the one additional star is for the free wireless in the room .
i 'm so sorry , pops .
but thanks for the febreezin ' anyway .
there is even a nicer super _num_ near lincoln avenue .
i do not know what else you could possibly be looking for in champaign .
also , some other indian guy accidentally barged in my room .
i have stayed here twice now !
i must say the service was great .
no complaints here , and i will def be back to stay .
honestly , do n't stay here unless every other hotel is booked .
we waited too long to book and this was all we could find .
the sheets in the bed looked clean but they were very worn .
i decided to skip a morning shower .
i just did n't want to touch anything in there .
the lobby was under construction and the staff was very pleasant .
do not stay here ! !
i screamed , my boyfriend squished it with a napkin .
seriously ?
no .
thank .
you .
we booked the room through priceline , only paid $ _num_ for room .
i do n't need fancy , i just need comfy .
it was so gross !
old , smelly , & creepy .
( of course my hubby would point out they had old tvs too . )
my hubby called to say he could n't stay there .
he went next door to la quinta for $ _num_ .
because i booked through priceline i was not allowed a refund .
this should tell you it is not ok to stay there !
classic case of getting what you pay for .
room size and cleanliness were acceptable and so was was the continental breakfast .
the room smell made the stay uncomfortable .
i will look for another place next time .
i 've heard of the saying `` beauty is pain '' - but sheesh !
get some fresh air flowing in here !
overall , it 's not awkward .
i was n't completely pleased with how quickly everything grew back ... grrrr .
kane & company is a little pricey for this town .
great people , great hair , great location .
i always get a great cut and color from erica .
she is a great stylist !
erica has been cutting my hair for a few years .
she does a great job and i would recommend her to friends !
i went to kane & co twice to get my hair done .
not to mention , her scissors were not sharp .
you can imagine what that felt like .
ursa cut my hair ( she 's new to the salon ) .
she did a fantastic job !
i felt like she really cared and is a very talented stylist .
i would go back !
i 've been a client of paul kane for over a decade .
excellent haircuts in a nice setting .
the salon has a friendly feel and a good vibe .
first of all , i love the calm atmosphere in the salon .
and i really think i found her .
i went in to see jillanna back in march and had a fabulous experience .
a cut costs $ _num_ but is worth every penny .
i highly highly recommend her !
he 's brilliant .
carly did a lovely job on my hair .
but not carly !
the end result is a fantastic edgy cut that is completely wash and go .
love it !
con : mega expensive
i have been following my girl ursa all around the town .
she is just the best and she is sooooo cute .
ps : i am a straight female : )
ursa rocks !
her work is top notch .
she is friendly and does n't rush through your appointment .
alex is also great at doing makeup .
ursa is simply the best .
ursa always did an amazing job and i ca n't recommend her enough .
i 've been getting my haircut by terra for the past _num_ years .
she has given me cuts that were more conservative and some more edgy .
terra simply knows exactly how to bring my hair from blah to amazing .
also kane and company is top notch .
the staff is super friendly and its easy to make appointments .
it took me _num_ years of college to find this place .
the salon staff are really friendly , and ursa is great !
the interior is nice and it 's in a beautiful old building .
so i have to say ursa always delivers .
finally found a nice salon that i can trust and is in my budget !
the owners and stylists are very nice and i loved my haircut .
i will definitely be coming back here from now on .
in fact , it was awful .
i reluctantly accepted the response and scheduled my appointment .
i reluctantly paid the $ _num_ and left .
they talked on the phone the next day and he was extremely rude .
they do n't care about anything except for your money .
i finally found my perfect salon !
everyone is so nice and the place is clean and organized .
i see carly to get my hair cut and she does an awesome job .
i wanted to cut my hair short and she really catered to my needs .
i just came in today for the first time and saw jenn .
i 'm very pleased with the service and the cut .
overall , i 'm a satisfied client and will be back !
definitely better than what 's currently available at ippatsu , at least .
i find her cuts to always be contemporary and flattering .
today she did a partial foil , using both high and low lights .
it really brightened things up without going over the top .
she has a good eye for style and good technical skills .
i am happy to have her as my stylist .
( i also have gone to alex who is top notch too ) .
i find her a delightful person to chat with too .
kane and co offers a pleasant , clean and bright setting .
i like that they remind me the day before an appointment .
i hope this makes the cut .
!
.
i plan on scheduling myself an appointment i 'll review that one also !
hopefully i 'll be just as pleased .
so happy to of found the perfect hair stylist for me !
i was a walk in and they were great !
the atmosphere is great , and very trendy .
they have water , teas , coffee to drink while getting a cut .
the staff was very friendly , and the price was great .
i will be back .
from receptionist to stylists , kane and co is professional and friendly .
when my stylist johnathon moved here from another salon i happily followed !
ursa is a rock star .
great cuts and color and great personality .
it does not hurt that she is very cute too : )
they are awesome .
this is th best barber shop i found in town .
i like my hair style .
like the chat .
definitely recommend this .
i 've been going here for _num_ years ! ! !
everywhere i go i always get compliments !
her personality and charisma make the visit so much fun and they look awesome !
we highly recommend kane & co. ! ! !
!
wow ...
so incredibly unprofessional !
they said they had no record of my appointment being made .
some got it close but others would always fall short of my expectations .
for reference , i 'm an asian male with relatively thick hair .
the same .
went there after seeing so many five star reviews on yelp .
and the second visit totally ruined my hair .
for sure will never ever go there again .
first , it 's very pricy .
forty-dollar 's hair cut .
it 's not worth the price .
i have tried twice .
after a few months , i gave a second try .
i totally obeyed their stylist recommendation and this time was even worse !
not recommended .
she 's amazing with coloring and cutting my hair exactly how i want .
i highly recommend her !
!
they are all so friendly and helpful !
i will definitely be going back for just about everything .
it looks almost exactly like the picture i brought in .
then she blow-dried and curled my hair for me and it looked amazing .
i would definitely see her for another dye appointment !
it 's always a good experience for me !
danielle can really handle any skin concerns and is super generous with her insights .
and , my previous review still totally stands !
most of the staff is very friendly and easy to talk to .
i love coming in here .
the only downside is the pricing .
came here for a drastic haircut today and loved it !
will be coming back !
humidity-proof , shiny ) .
i read one of the reviews which recommended lauren .
i see danielle for my eyebrows and she is amazing ! !
only person i will go to ever !
!
i had a bad experience the first time cutting my hair at the salon .
i highly recommend her .
danielle took care of all of my waxing needs .
fabulous cuts and wonderful customer service .
melissa did a wonderful job ! ! !
the salon is really nice , reasonable prices , and my highlights/cut look perfect !
thank you !
!
michelle benjamin-remember that name , write it down if you have to !
michelle is an esthetician and she is levels more than that .
my skin is glowing and looks better than it has since my youth .
i adore this salon and will be back very soon .
i love love love melissa cave .
ca n't wait for my next appointment : )
melissa 's got the men 's hair game down to a tee .
and there 's wine too .
she got my requests spot on , preserving my hairstyle .
very professional , hassle-free and friendly .
i like that .
!
danielle ( esthetics/skin care ) at kane and company is amazing .
needless to say , i will be returning !
!
needless to say , i will never gp back to shaving !
l-o-v-e this place !
loved my color and cut .
thank you melissa !
!
i went here to find out about wedding dress alterations .
i would not recommend .
the proprietor can be a bit brusque , but not rude .
the alterations took about a week .
i also found her rude , unwilling to answer questions .
she has been doing repairs for me for years .
she is excellent and fair priced .
she actually did alterations for my wedding dress and it was perfect .
in conclusion - yes for barbara if you need something taken in .
they did a good job on taking in the skirts and hemming .
however i did think that they were a bit pricey .
i will visit again , though .
they know what they are doing , and that is the most important thing .
i ca n't recommend barbara enough .
her work is consistent , timely , and a bargain .
barbara is great for the small fix as well as the bigger projects .
and she still managed it !
she has hit the nail on the head _num_ times .
i do n't understand people commenting on her attitude .
thanks
trust yelp , ladies and gentlemen .
kay jewelers was one of those times .
i said i saw what i wanted online and could they order it ?
really ! ! !
i even had a business card and she gave a weird look .
she did n't know the warranty plans when i asked her .
even sold the wrong size ring to us after we tried it on .
could have been one of those days ... consumer beware
i live in coffee shops .
i 've been to almost every one in champaign/urbana and many in chicago .
this one will always be my favorite .
parking is a little tough sometimes , but that 's normal for the town .
it 's small too , so sometimes you ca n't find a seat .
in true caf style , the art on the walls is always changing .
this is cu 's top-notch coffee shop .
they have delicious hot and cold drinks and wonderfully fresh pastries .
and a diverse enough menu to provide sustenance .
here is what i love at kopi :
the staff
the vibe
the cucumber , roasted red pepper , goat cheese sandwich
the green salad
the grilled cheese with tomatoes
the princess cookies
the earl grey tea
the cucumber water
the doorway to circles
cafe kopi is one of the better cafs in town .
loads better than espresso royal , panera , and starbucks for sure .
i would give it _num_ 1/2 stars if i could give half-stars .
i find their coffee to be robust without being bitter .
their chai is some of the best in town .
that is not so tasty to me .
definitely the best coffee shop in champaign-urbana .
great coffee , plus you can get port and some other boozy drinks .
ok so the chairs are uncomfortable after a while , that 's true .
no couches to encourage settling in for the long haul .
that 's probably good for business though ; nobody would ever leave otherwise .
the ambiance is great , and sitting outside people-watching on walnut is wonderful .
nice atmosphere but not so nice hot chocolate .
eww .
i lived in champaign-urbana for nine years .
kopi was my favorite .
alright ... cafe kopi deserves its full _num_ stars .
you 'd almost forget you 're in champaign for a second .
relaxed laid-back atmosphere , cool music , friendly service .
great coffee shop !
easily the best espresso for at least a _num_ mile radius .
the coffee at kopi is wicked good .
love it .
a thousand times better at night when it 's brightly lit .
afternoons are gross .
i really liked this place .
and open tables .
and right over the air conditioning vent .
i tried the pesto turkey panini which was fabulous .
and they wear gloves when they make your sandwhiches .
and cute garnishes .
i suppose it 's worth it ) .
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
okay , not all tables and chairs are created equal .
i ended up sitting at a very uncomfortable table .
to visit and chat- no problem .
but studying- towards the back would be better .
luckily someone left and i grabbed a different table .
but still , great coffee , music , and good place to go .
i still definitely recommend .
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
and i still love their turkey panini !
!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
i prefer their house coffee to their `` coffee of the day '' .
i admit the coffee here is stellar .
however , the ambience is all wrong .
its super dim and crowded ambiance rubbed me a little the wrong way .
however , every single table was taken by some student ! ?
geez .
your eyes will go bad if you try to read in that light !
you 're growing on me , kopi .
night times are great to study here , or cold rainy days .
also , the tuna bacon melt is the greatest thing in the universe .
one day i saw him write `` glasses , blue sweater , beard -- ''
also , scotch enthusiasts : they serve it .
i know .
odd .
but delicious .
having basically moved in here during last semester , i must rave about it !
great atmosphere with regulars and they do n't mind if you camp out .
i second the praise of the mediterranean sandwich too !
kopi is ... meh .
i go here a lot because i live nearby .
let 's take one example : the flies in the pastry case .
they act like flies are an insurmountable puzzle never before encountered by anyone else .
try a flyswatter .
or a trap that does n't use insecticide ( like the sticky ones ) .
or buy a larger insect zapper .
i still go there because there are n't that many nearby cafes .
the staff are very nice and the curried egg salad pita is good .
also i wish the dim lighting and the weak espresso could be improved .
but the bagels are good .
it 's a mixed bag .
whatever .
i also was n't too impressed with the snicker-doodles that we ordered .
not bad , but not great either .
i guess i 'd try this place once more , just to be fair .
good coffee .
not as strong as i 'd like , but tasteful .
kopi was a random choice & it fits my purposes perfectly !
they even have sandwiches for when i 'm hungry again !
if we move here , i 'll be back to kopi !
the sandwiches are okay .
they use high quality ingredients , but they are still just sandwiches .
their soups are not great .
great place to study .
it 's an indie coffee shop which is a nice change from starbucks/panera .
drinks are really good , priced about the same as starbucks .
daily specials are on the cheap side .
food and pastries are good but a little overpriced .
definitely one of my favorite places in champaign .
not really a fan .
i usually have a pretty good experience here .
the old woodwork in the building is peaceful .
huh ?
$ _num_ for a condiment ?
not worth it .
great place for coffee and good studying ! !
or the other way around ?
whichever .
as far as customer service , it 's fair .
not the best cafe , but i return here frequently to get studying/work done .
i would recommend this place to others .
cafe kopi has the best cappuccino 's in champaign/urbana .
something is just not right about the espresso ; it has a metallic taste .
machine needs cleaning perhaps ?
needs filtered water ?
cafe kopi 's ok ... .
at kopi a latte is espresso with warmed up milk , not steamed milk .
the espresso 's also not as good as it could be .
i 've bought their beans and made stuff at home .
i really do n't know what they 're doing back there .
i do n't think they have any idea how to make espresso beverages either .
if only we could combine aroma cafe and cafe kopi .
then downtown champaign would finally have the perfect coffee house .
oh , cafe kopi .
the food is good , especially the lox and cream cheese on a bagel .
umph .
god , so tasty .
i come from washington , so i know good salmon .
i 've tried , but no dice .
put some of that shit on the floor .
second , the service here is pretty iffy .
every third member of the staff is friendly and helpful .
come on , dude .
you 're picking up my napkins and washing my plate after i leave .
you 're not better than me .
so , i dunno , i 'm torn .
but lord almighty , that lox .
i love this place !
the drinks are always delicious .
definitely the best coffee shop in the champaign-urbana area .
on top of this , they have consistent closing hours at midnight .
also , the sandwich sizes are tiny given their price .
great mochas .
very tasty .
worth the walk from campus .
i love it here .
nice atmosphere , good drinks .
i love the cafe miel and the mate latte .
love this place .
i used to live basically upstairs and this was my go to spot .
no compaints here !
great atmosphere , delicious coffee , awesome food .
this is my default stop for coffee or a place to spend the afternoon .
it can get a little crowded at times though .
the thai tempeh sandwhich is amazing , also try the cold brew coffee sometime .
prices are out of hand at kopi .
$ _num_ for a pint of pasta salad ?
$ _num_ for a cup of yogurt with _num_ blueberries and some granola ?
as best i can guess , kopi mgt .
bigger kitchen for more diverse menu ?
catering ?
advertise the booze ?
thankfully by reference of a patient of mine i was referred to kopi .
i couldnt be more pleased .
the food is pretty scrumptious too .
enjoy !
try the baby greens salad or the greek salad with no feta cheese .
some soups are vegan but ask to make sure !
also , try the thai tempe or the matty pooh hummus .
for drinks , get the chai latte with soy and no honey .
and their chocolate for mochas are vegan !
i love the atmosphere here , it 's very chill .
their coffee is n't bad and the service is pretty good .
it 's all in the details .
the drinks themselves were rich and delicious .
music selection is kind of weird ( whiny sounding hipster music ?
basically : i really like this place .
hip and what not but still a good place .
do n't order the food unless you are desperate .
lesson learned : do n't get the thai tempeh panini .
i really would want to avoid this place because of the service .
every time i 've been here , they always get something wrong .
i just feel that the are n't very attentive .
first of all , it was sweltering outside and i ordered iced mochas .
one with soy , one regular .
ugh .
i dunno , new hire ?
the sandwiches are decent ( had the turkey and gruyere .
i have enjoyed kopi for a number of years .
the coffee is always decent .
i enjoy the tuna melt as well .
both are not fantastic but very solid .
however , i love their chai bomb .
it elevates my rating from _num_ to _num_ .
although i would love a _num_ .
highly recommended .
kopi is always a place to stop when in the cu area .
i do n't know .
the coffee is just ok .
my favorite sandwiches for lunch -- great mediterranean and grilled cheese + tomato sandwiches .
best chai latte in town , if not in the country ; d
really great food !
chai latte is yummy and not too sweet .
the chicken salad and sugar cookies are delicious .
food presentation is fantastic .
food is way better than espresso royale ( saran wrap = no go ) .
service is prompt and usually cheerful .
leave them a good tip !
the space is great ... if you can poach a table .
for those who bike , there are racks on the curb .
cafe kopi did not disappoint !
we all finished off with some sweets .
i came here with a friend hearing good things .
it 's a great place to come study and get off campus .
the drinks are pretty good .
i had the mango italian soda .
it 's fizzy and sweet .
the staff is super friendly and knowledgable .
last friday i visited with my daughter who lives in champaign .
after lunch and shopping what 's next ?
you guessed it , coffee !
there 's a nice little patio , good food for lunch and great coffee !
it was pretty warm so i had their iced vanilla latte .
i had their iced ginger cookies and they were really good .
this is my home away from home .
this place is wonderful , granted you can find a place to sit .
sometimes it 's a chocolaty blend from nicaragua or something strong from peru .
i 'm probably making this up .
there 's wi-fi , obviously .
there 's a decent food selection , too .
i love their pita and hummus .
they also have everything bagels , which i like lightly toasted and plain .
anyway , what really makes this place great is the staff .
hands down -- the friendliest bunch of baristas in town .
i have no shame in spending every waking hour in this coffee shop .
i get all my work done , and i see friendly faces .
i feel like one of them .
lol .
okay , i 'll stop now .
try the latte or the tea .
great selection of herbal teas -- my goodness .
excellent stuff .
also , the `` pots of tea '' are great .
i 'd suggest that anyone spending time in downtown champaign come here !
what kind of place would ever serve a latte in a tumbler ?
for the listed reasons , the latte was given zero stars .
the coffee is good , the tea selection is very nice .
the quality of the food is very good .
i had some time to kill a couple times in champaign .
i tried this place and also cafe aroma .
both were nice but i definitely would go back to cafe kopi .
it 's as good as it gets with regard to coffee houses .
the food was really delicious and the coffee was excellent too .
the atmosphere was very pleasant and the people seemed good-natured .
i 'd remove this from your list of coffee options when visiting champaign-urbana .
located this place on yelp and stopped for lunch .
great atmosphere and character , clearly a place to study on the weekend .
we ordered a sandwich and a coffee , which both were great .
recommend the turkey and brie open faced sandwich .
love this place .
amazing coffee , some of the best i 've ever had .
very unique flavor .
incredibly helpful and friendly staff .
everything i ordered was suggested to me by the man taking my order .
the turkey sandwich he suggested was absolutely delicious .
wish i lived closer so that i could come here more often !
i 've been here over a dozen times .
for a coffee shop , it 's terrible .
the only good coffee drink i 've had is the cafe miel .
also , the baked goods are just terrible .
so why am i giving it 3/5 stars ?
because the lunch is excellent .
and the environment is the best .
i love it for that but i would n't recommend it to an outsider .
there are much better places in town !
the coffee is decent , too .
i will say that i am not a fan of the food here .
i think it 's overpriced and sloppy .
once i had an oreo brownie here , and it was beyond terrible .
i love cafe kopi !
my husband and i come here every saturday and have for years .
the owner and staff could not be friendlier !
they are efficient , courteous and always polite .
the only slight negative i would give is the scones .
that does not deter me from my _num_ star rating !
!
i love this place , but wish it would be open later than midnight .
i could honestly work here for hours at a time .
docking _num_ star only because it 's usually hard to find a good spot .
i guess i should say something about the beverages ...
tea , however , is the surprise triumph , here .
the bold green `` earthiness '' is balanced with a sweet shot of vanilla .
five stars , minus the lack of seats .
if you find one , you 're set .
i 've recently been experiencing very hit or miss service .
this coffee shop got me through college .
i use to love going here in the summer .
lots of outdoor seat .
when i first started going there , they served beer and wine .
it was amazing .
haha and thats fine .
it is a mix of vanilla and honey .
let me tell you ... it is perfect .
i get it every time i am down in champaign .
i do n't think i have ever had another latte like it anywhere else .
and i used to work at a coffee shop in chicago .
plus their food is organic and delicious .
great place for late night studying since they 're open until midnight !
i love the big room with little lamps at the tables .
also , a very friendly staff and great coffee , of course .
good coffee and hot drinks .
breakfast menu leaves a bit to be desired .
something other than pastries ?
very delicious and not too sweet drinks !
one the cutest and coolest coffee joints i 've ever seen .
the baristas are awesome .
i really like this coffee shop !
i have been here a few times when my band has played in town !
lots of outlets , clean bathrooms , and great service !
i 'm a coffee shop-kind of girl .
i thoroughly enjoyed it as i read my book on this quiet sunday morning .
it was definitely a nice option for those that are not mocha lovers .
) .
they have a yummy hummus and the coffee is ok .
to cap it off , they 're credit card friendly !
i think cafe kopi must be the most overrated coffee shop in town .
yes , the wifi is good , but the prices are outrageous .
afe kopi is my favorite coffee shop in this town .
the baristas are angels .
nothing about the food ( appearance , taste ) are worth $ _num_ .
their bakery items are also really bad yet somehow very expensive .
tuna salad is six dollars !
what ?
!
about that straight espresso though ...
the barista clearly had no idea what she was doing .
the end result : a syurpy , ungodly-sour brew with no pleasant flavors .
this is a great study spot with good coffee .
it has a great cozy-coffee shop feel .
they have a lot of power outlets and the music is not overpowering .
my favorite thing to get here is the chai tea latte .
the customers have this mutual understanding that it is a study spot .
was looking for a good espresso while driving through , found it here .
also a great selection of snacks and light meals .
would go again when in the area .
i thoroughly enjoyed my time at cafe kopi .
i was there on a tuesday afternoon for a couple of hours .
internet speeds were great and the food was fantastic .
i ordered a turkey and swiss from the sandwich menu .
they have free cucumber or orange infused water .
the art was beautiful and the atmosphere was on point .
_num_ stars from me !
upon entering , i was definitely feeling the relaxing vibe .
i could definitely see myself studying here if i went to school here .
it was quiet , chill , and clean .
another thing i liked .
unfortunately , neither barista greeted us , even after eye contact .
and there were five of us .
i know they saw us .
immediately overwhelmed by the 'oh-you're-not-a-hipster-like-us ? '
vibe , which , ironically , did go with the ambiance of the place .
ordering was as pleasant as the barista 's demeanor , what a surprise .
/sarcasm
opted for the cafe late , which turned out to be delicious !
was n't too hot , was n't too cold .
perfect for the weather .
there are stairs in the back , but do not go up these .
there is no seating !
it 's a trap !
oh , and make sure to clean up after yourselves when you 're done !
there are tubs for dishes and glassware here and there for you .
no one likes to clean up after someone else 's mess !
key points then ;
-good drinks
-snooty baristas
-very full
all the right stuff here , for my needs today .
fresh made food items and great coffee also .
i had the goat cheese sandwich with pesto on side .
really good .
friend had the brie/turkey sandwich and said also very good .
great service here from entire staff .
my kind of coffee stop .
thanks folks .
well done .
one of the greatest places for coffee in town .
a good coffee experience !
the ambience is eclectic and comfortable , with spacious outdoor seating .
staff was friendly and my drink came out quickly .
prices are reasonable - at least compared to chicago !
amazing , relaxing atmosphere , great for doing work or just chilling .
good range of espresso drinks .
top _num_ cappucino in the c-u area , easily
wifi is rather slow .
they should password-protect it .
this espresso is divine .
not burnt like some places .
it 's just delightful , and the employees are wonderful here
the cafe is totally worth a visit .
i live locally and often go to kopi to study for tests .
just watch your timing !
during finals time , you will be hard pressed to find a seat .
cafe kopi is hands down my favorite coffee shop in the cu area .
i can not even count the number of times i have journeyed to kopi .
my favorite thing to order in the winter is the gingerbread chai latte .
it has the perfect combination of cinnamon , coffee , and gingerbread notes .
in the summer i have iced tea .
if you go there often , consider buying a kopi cup .
you get discounts if you bring it in !
the atmosphere is what really gets me .
the wooden tables look rugged , but they are so smooth !
there is local artwork on the walls that gives a `` hometown '' atmosphere .
there is about _num_ or _num_ tables outside that you can sit at .
not a word , and i even gave them a tip !
avoid until they get over themselves .
i love this place !
it 's a cool space , different wooden chairs/tables and some chill tunes .
they have awesome staff members and delicious drinks .
i like the americano , or mocha lattes .
it was great that they open late ( until midnight ) on most days .
good coffee and environment with internet to do work .
love the wood table and chairs .
hands down my favorite cafe to get work done .
closes at midnight and plenty of indoor/outdoor seating .
need a study break ?
order a panini and salad .
getting sleepy ?
grab one of their caffeinated drinks .
just stopped in for a cappuccino and a little dessert after a big dinner .
cappuccino was also perfectly acceptable and hit the spot .
i like the outdoor tables .
they have a ton of teas , baked goods and seating too .
i really like this local and awesome bussiness .
cute place and great coffee .
i ordered a latte with almond milk .
very good !
not many places offer almond , soy , and coconut milk .
i appreciate the options since i ca n't have dairy .
lots of tables and great selection of drinks .
the music is softer than a few other places in town .
sometimes a little cold .
around lunch time , it can be hard to find a table .
check it out .
one of the best cafes in chambana .
i specifically love their teas and lattes .
very interesting urban feel to the place .
literally , they use old desks from the university .
you wo n't be disappointed with kopi !
my absolute favorite coffee shop in all of champaign .
the baristas are always super friendly , nice , and helpful .
the coffee is solid and the food there is perfect for what it is .
the drinks are good .
food is ok. free wifi .
drink & food specials on the chalkboard at the entrance of the caf .
can be crowded & loud at times .
my go-to coffee place for study sessions , hangout/meetups or even just a coffee .
love the ambience .
the barristers are super friendly , the place is nice .
to top it , they usually have some daily specials on expresso drinks !
what exactly is a four star coffee shop ?
i 'm not a coffee lover so my understanding of their prices is minimal .
however , they do have bagels , croissants , and muffins .
i ordered a red tea latte , which was really delicious !
cafe kopi is large with many seating areas .
they also have free wifi , which is a plus .
a cute little cafe in downtown champaign .
i am a huge fan of fizzy water so they were both great !
my only complaint was that the place was a little crammed !
but i had very high expectations going in , so overall wonderful ( :
my favorite coffee in town .
i appreciate their consistent presence in downtown champaign .
staff is always on point .
i like coffee .
i like vegetarian food .
i like good places to hang out and enjoy both of these things .
this place has that .
plus sweet sugary treats .
low key .
nice vibe .
be there .
one of the best spots i 've found during my time in c-u .
the interior is really warm and cozy .
they also have free wifi .
it was fresh , light and tasty .
so this place is definitely one of the gems in downtown champaign .
it 's very similar to aroma cafe and pekara bakery in the area .
they have a larger seating space than the other cafes though .
man was i disappointed by my experience here .
it was .
so i said , `` do you think it 's the machine ?
could you type it in or run it again ?
i double checked my balance and it 's fine '' .
the woman said `` no i do n't need to run it again .
your card was rejected .
deal with it .
call the bank if you want .
but leave .
i need you to leave the counter now ''
but thanks anyway for throwing a little negativity my way .
last time i 'll come here .
love the atmosphere here .
so relaxing ! ! !
coffee is delicious and services are very friendly .
highly recommended !
!
i really love cafe kopi ! !
i also love their chai latte !
ithis place has a very cozy feel to it !
i love finding local hidden gems and checking them out .
though cafe kopi is n't so hidden , the inside is completely unsuspecting .
i eagerly awaited my delicious delectables with my clown fish table marker in tow .
the crowd here is very friendly and surprisingly open .
now the reason for the three stars .
back on track , it eerily resembled the white chocolate mocha at starbucks .
spot on resembled it , which is n't bad .
i was expecting something unique and bold just like the cafe kopi .
though i loved everything else- service , patrons , atmosphere and yummy food .
had a delicious light lunch after the champaign historical walking tour in april .
tuna melt and soup were delicious .
and that was the first real live cream soda that i 've ever had .
that was amazing !
please try it .
what makes this beverage pop is the honey .
no overkill here , but just the right recipe for a latt .
their great for staying and savoring your beverage or for on the go .
when i think of champaign i think of cafe kopi .
it has that cool , hipster coffee shop vibe that i crave .
i recommend trying the red latte and chicken salad pita .
those are my favorites .
whenever i need a place to relax i choose kopi .
also ... .the poetry desk .
it 's so cool seeing what other people have left behind .
check it out !
the best service ever !
once i came here extremely sick and i kept coughing .
met a colleague here for a meeting , and it was the perfect spot .
free wifi with no password required .
they also had plenty of seating .
that 's me being very picky , though .
sadly .
i will say that for the basics , it 'll do just fine .
also , the service is always lacked .
it 's strange .
i was just there and saw a sale sign for an ott-lite .
the sign said _num_ watt on sale for _num_ regular _num_ - great deal .
however , it rang up as _num_ .
i brought him the sign and he reluctantly called the manager .
why should i bother shopping here ?
i love this store , this was my first time there on a sunday .
happy that they are open on a sunday .
the service was very friendly and quick and so was the check out .
also bought some fabric for a very good price .
i know i will visit more often .
at least jo-ann 's matches competitor coupons .
i have only been here a couple of times .
my last visit was for some material for a table cloth .
the person cutting the fabric was very nice and the check out was fast .
i was in and out in less than _num_ minutes .
great store for arts and crafts supplies , very helpful staff .
saved me a bunch of money !
store is not at address on neil street .
it is near hhgregg on prospect .
someone should update the address/location .
this store , on par with most , is an extravaganza of the senses !
from chiffon by the bolt to potpourri fragrance packets , joann 's stock assails !
can benefit from a trip !
say it with me now : blaaaaaaaaaand .
i 've always ordered pad thai , and i like it .
i burned my tongue eating it but i could n't stop myself : ) .
that is the only thing i order whenever i go there .
yay !
i dig nitaya .
most importantly , our waiter was awesome .
he was friendly , engaging and ultimately really helpful .
i loved me some nitaya .
i 'll be back .
: )
so much so , that ti deserves a five star .
the best part , however ?
he made a reference to `` pedagogy of teh oppressed . ''
fantastic .
now , can we make the food a bit more exciting next time ?
almost everything was well over $ _num_ per meal , even the staple stuff .
second problem : no leftovers .
you fucked it up ! ''
i really enjoyed the pad thai from this place .
they can even specialize yours by making it more spicy if you want .
nitaya thai is a good thai restaurant .
their pad thai with chicken is very good .
i find the portions to be more than enough and the pricing reasonable .
go trya nitaya !
the food is good here , quite good actually .
their pad thai is fairly good .
it 's not drowned with peanut sauce so you can actually taste the tamarind .
the decor is dated classic for a thai restaurant .
they have a full bar , which is really nice .
a strong ipa pairs well with most everything on the menu .
their green curry is delectable .
flavor spot-on .
i ordered the spiciness level at american hot .
it was amazing- just on the verge of being too spicy for me .
perfection !
the tom kah was fairly good .
tom kah should be made with straw mushies .
straw !
first off , our waiter only understood about _num_ % of what we said .
he checked with the chef and came back and verified my suspicions .
he did n't understand and sent the manager over .
i cook thai food at home .
i know what different fish taste like .
we wo n't be going back !
nitaya , how do you survive ?
the food is not offensively bad , just forgettable .
) .
wanted thai while on champaign for work .
tried this place and it was good but very small portions .
sorry , not a fan .
after the disappointing crab rangoon , i was served my chicken pad kee mao .
i ordered it spicy .
ok. maybe that 's a tad overdramatic but seriously , this stuff was hawt .
whew .
it was n't really bad but it just was n't great either .
i did however enjoy the ambience and the comfy booths .
we ate tonight at nitaya , and our food was excellent .
i had the pineapple chicken curry and my wife had a modified number _num_ .
we had potstickers for an appetizer and sticky rice and mango for dessert .
the service was great and no problems with english understanding him or us .
the food is delicious .
we have gone twice , and both times were great .
first we went for the lunch special and had green curry .
they give you a free soup to begin , which was nice and warming .
the curry was savory and creamy .
i had the padthai , which was excellent .
the waitstaff is friendly and professional .
the only weird thing is how empty the place always is .
this was the must disgusting restaurant i have eaten at in years .
we ordered the dumplings and they arrived freezer cold .
really .
ok , could have lived with that .
green curry arrived with hair in both the rice and the curry dish .
next up was going to the bathroom .
this place is a health hazard .
my husband and i went there and i ordered the pad thai .
i took a couple bites and noticed a hair in it .
a black , curly-ish , _num_ inch long , hair .
i was obviously disgusted and i told the waiter .
i said i could n't eat it and he turned and left .
he ran away because he did n't want to deal with it .
i tried to get his attention but he was ignoring us !
what ?
really ?
also , the few bites of pad thai that i did have were awful .
not flavorful at all .
the sauce was almost creamy .
i understand , sometimes things may end up in the food .
i 'll be reasonable about that .
they did n't do that or even try .
i will never be back .
good authentic thai food .
my only issue is that the portions could be a little bit bigger .
i ordered the pad-see-ew and was glad the chicken resembled chicken .
friendly staff .
the space is weird , but makes it different .
feels like your at mom 's house being served hot/fresh , delicious food .
sweet sweet , fast wait staff , lovely environment
if only i 'd written this review so much sooner *smh* soooo yummy
good food but they need to be more consistent .
in fact , i think their food is the best thai in town .
old school thai restaurant .
) , and a rice bean noodle dish i love .
i order everything medium , heat wise and it 's still pretty hot .
four years ago i mistakenly ordered hot and it burned twice !
food is good too .
a let down ...

http : //www.thaifoodaficionado.com/2012/06/nitaya-thai-champaign-il.html
found a bug in my rice ...
if you are prepared to be treated like that , visit it .
this place has the best tom yum soup in all of champaign/ urbana ! !
do n't judge a book by its cover !
reasonably priced & great food !
i wish they had mee krob with the red sweet & sour sauce .
i ca n't find this dish anywhere in c-u !
!
that said , this place was great .
i like my food really , really spicy .
keep in mind i fix tacos with bhut jolokias and habanero peppers .
i like spicy food .
the setting was fun , service was great , mango sticky rice was fantastic .
so far , it is my top in champaign .
had a lunch special and spring roll for appetizer .
forgot the name of the lunch special .
it was a stir-fried meat and vegetable dish with rice .
it was too oily for me .
thank to the lunch special the price was not expensive .
but i think i 'll never visit this restaurant again .
their food is average .
i did n't hate anything but there 's nothing too special about it .
i did have a small problem with the service .
we had to approach her to ask for whatever we needed .
kind of annoying .
besides that , it was okay .
nitaya thai never disappoints !
it was the first place i had thai .
the crab rangoon is amazing .
my fav is the pad thai .
it is full of flavor .
be careful when choosing your spice level !
medium spicy is plenty spicy and i love spicy food .
some of the best thai food i have had in a long time .
they have the best pad thai in town .
if you are looking for real thai food go here !
ordered mock duck curry and mussamun curry .
very disappointed .
both seemed very oily and extremely watery .
the consistency of the curry was just not there .
potato in the curry tasted like it was canned .
no authentic thai flavors .
bland and tasteless .
no taste of herbs or coconut milk .
have tried some of their noodles before which is good .
will probably give one more chance .
that being said , it 's definitely not my favorite place in the area .
but eating there is just kind of depressing sometimes .
i wo n't be back .
this was the worst thai food i 've ever had !
they used canned mango for my mango and sticky rice dessert .
the chicken stays were microwaved .
this experience was very disappointing .
the older woman who started to serve me was not very nice at all .
the thai iced tea was delicious !
my friends ' dishes looked delicious as well .
they did n't seem to have many servers working .
i felt like it was a little expensive for what i got .
this review is for take out service .
the girl at the counter was polite and friendly .
she helped me select a delicious meal .
food : i felt both soup and curry to be very watery .
the curry was good a lot of curry not a lot of shrimp .
but again the flavors of not the consistency were in point .
warning check your credit cards and bill ! ! !
refused to refund fraud charges ! !
!
me and my friend were double charged on our credit cards !
but when i came in she would n't refund me ! !
she told me i should have handled it that night .
i had to dispute it from the credit card company .
the sad part ?
the food was n't even good : (
update : after _num_ months the credit card issue was resolved .
what 's worse ?
dont eat here unless you want a two month ordeal for fraud charges .
ew ! ! !
avoid this dirty horrible establishment at all costs ! !
then , my boyfriend got food poisoning for the first time in years .
i called the owner to inform her and ask for a refund .
the conversation with the owner was unbelievable , laughable at best .
she demanded to know what else we ate .
and if he was allergic to anything he ordered .
she was defensive , argumentative , and inappropriate .
at one point she hung up on me !
she states because she did n't hear me speak .
you should be nice to the people and high degree you should be professional .
! ! ! ! ?
?
?
!
anyway , reporting her to the health department .
can i report her to the police too for verbal assault ?
haha .
decent pad thai that is prepared pretty quickly .
my _num_ year old step daughter loves it too .
never once have gotten sick like some previous yelpers have .
no complaints and if you want great thai food ... go here
ordered delivery with grubhub on a friday afternoon .
delivery was much faster than expected .
the rangoons were underwhelming .
they tasted good but appeared to be seriously lacking any crab .
my pad thai beef was very good .
it had a semi-sweet , nutty flavor and blended together quite well .
the beef seemed to be of decent quality , and tender .
the portion was fairly large , too .
my other issue was the fairly high cost .
i probably should 've just stuck with the chicken .
overall , the food was good but i felt very high priced .
i think i 'll just do that next time .
i did n't have any major problems .
they had a quick and friendly maintenance staff .
overall , one of the better large management companies on campus .
people might know this because their apartments fill up fast .
consequently there is usually no room for negotiation with these guys .
i will consider them for future apartments .
lived in _num_ e white st , champaign for half a year .
the worst is , they have bedbugs .
anyway , never resident in _num_ e white !
jsm is timely , polite , friendly , and knowledgeable .
signing with jsm was a pleasant , hassle-free experience .
this underlined for me that they are not in the business of deception .
move-in was a breeze .
it was a rental miracle .
hail , jsm .
praise be the three-lettered divinity that is jsm .
jsm is great .
***update***
the roach problem is out of control .
i 've seen grandaddy-sized roaches and pinhole sized babies and everything in between .
and one just crawled into my blender !
after this incident i checked my electric water boiler .
yup -- there are roaches in my water boiler .
my apartment has already been sprayed three times now .
***update***
hey , jsm ?
why are you doing construction in our units while we are living here ?
it feels like i 'm living in the dust bowl .
i ca n't stop coughing and my nose burns .
and no i do n't mean _num_ days .
and that was only a notification for construction on my own apartment .
did you contact us about all the floors above us getting hammered to bits ?
do i want to wake up to this for months ?
we 're just cash cows and you 're sucking them titties til they crispy .
you do n't give a fuck about the people behind the rent .
if you did , you would n't have done this .
would you personally have consented to this ?
thanks a fuckton for drilling all over my clothes , purses , and shoes .
and there 's shit all over my bed .
do i get a cleanup ?
or a dry cleaning fee ?
can i at least get a quarter of my monthly rent back ?
oh by the way , the roaches are back too .
parents , be aware of jsm .
contrast with tower at 3rd for a $ _num_ move-out carpet cleaning .
however , i am a very clean tenant and did all my cleaning .
i still remember the first day i moved in and carpet cleaned .
the water was black after multiple passes .
jsm owns and poorly runs uptown crossing in normal , illinois .
if you are thinking of renting here ... do n't do it !
the apartments are not in good shape considering that they are fairly new .
small and very pricey .
stay away from jsm properties ... they should be sanctioned for their misrepresentations .
it is sad how continually they are allowed to take advantage of their tenants .
the construction is getting ridiculous at this point .
spring break is over now .
this is not right .
it 's not fair .
i want my rent back .
this is pushing a month .
i ca n't study , cook , or sleep here .
what 's the point of paying $ 500+ for a sub-par storage room ?
this is ridiculous .
who does long construction while people are living there ?
where are we supposed to go ?
jsm staggered the floors so that there is perpetual construction for a semester .
that 's just not right .
today is april _num_ , _num_ .
today i got my apartment back .
construction started on march _num_ , _num_ .
you fill in the blanks about why jsm is getting a one star .
the apartment is a mess .
jsm left me in the dust .
they do n't care about their tenants .
i talked to a lawyer yesterday .
jsm is notorious for disrespecting their tenants .
they , i quote , are `` dogs '' .
do not give them your half+ grand a month .
# nevertrustascamlord
bet that makes abuses of landlord-tenant trust pretty convenient .
its honestly such a disappointment because i loved jsm .
i could n't stop raving about you guys to my friends .
i value a functioning filter , but not in this case .
feel my anger and do not rent from jsm .
they allegedly sent in a cleaning crew ...
thanks ?
i guess ?
that 's weird because my apartment was still dirty .
the couch ( theirs ) was singularly horrible .
throughout construction it managed to absorb every fleck of dust and debris .
everything i touched ... my hand came up gray .
i 'm still shaking out paint chips and sawdust from my clothes .
thank you for ruining my leather bags and clothes with white paint dust .
goodbye time .
goodbye money .
i 'm a student .
i need somewhere to live .
i do not have time to play maid , jsm .
also , wow , what a surprise .
coincidence ?
lol , jsm , why did n't you bring people in impromptu during construction ?
oh right , because everyone would see what you 're really like .
selfish , selfish .
i did n't even get a notification about the showing either .
you did n't see the huge pitfalls of this landlord .
watch out .
send a cleaning crew for that , bitch .
***update***
jsm has not responded to a single one .
it is now the summer and they have yet to respond
dear jsm , there is only _num_ desk that came with my apartment .
i was also charged for floor cleaning .
after i touched roach shit !
just do n't rent from jsm .
i hope more students see this review and inform their little sophomore friends .
if this rating were solely for their manners , jsm would receive 6/5 stars .
they are really nice and individually wonderful .
the building is absolutely riddled with roaches .
they 've made homes in my small appliances and pooped all over the cabinets .
there were even roaches in my stove .
i almost drank a roach that had crawled into my water boiler .
do n't even think about leaving a glass of water out overnight .
you forget once and you 're asking for trouble .
this has been the most disgusting experience of my life .
avoid living here .
it has been ineffective .
i was reading a guide on reddit for getting rid of roaches .
two to five ?
kid , you have it good .
i could n't believe this guy thought he had it bad .
that ai n't nothing .
it 's a huge waste of time .
do n't live here .
yes , i have dead roaches falling out of my stuff .
again , do n't live here .
jsm came to my building weekly to clean the laundry area and hallways .
i 've never seen any trash or lint lying around .
the machines are always super clean .
every common space just looks pristine .
i really appreciate that .
everything was ok after move in although the furnishings were dated and quite worn .
considering it was college living we let a lot of things slide .
this unit is by far the worse unit you can possibly get yourself into .
the apartment itself was disgusting ' ! !
i fell sick the first week .
not to mention the place is infested with spiders !
when i first came in the filters were dirty and disgusting !
the management office staff members are extremely rude and inefficient with their duties .
ca n't wait to move out of this company .
by far the worst place i ever loved at in my life .
do not live with them .
they do not care at all about you .
chinese herbs are the best solution to treat them .
so i went to see dr. gu .
plus , herbs have no side effects beside it does not taste good .
dr ge has helped me twice with my health .
very fast and great results .
highly recommended !
dr. ge has been my acupuncturist for over _num_ years .
his knowledge and practice has significantly improved the quality of my life .
i will give you needles and herbs and you will get better . ''
that statement has always become true for me .
i like farren 's pretty well for a happy hour type dinner .
the grilled steak salad and sweet potato fries are my favorites .
the everything-topped crackers that accompany the salads are light , and a real treat .
and their prices have stayed the same for years now ( unreal , no ?
) , which translates into a good deal in _num_ .
yes , they have good burgers and a mean veggie burger .
yes , they were the original killer-beer-selection place before there was a blind pig .
but mostly , just go to farren 's for the salads ! !
!
farren 's is one of those hidden gems you do n't find everyday .
if its your first time time i defiantly recommend trying one of their burgers .
im not sure what 's better their burgers or salads .
they also have outstanding wings and beers !
hell to the mothereffin ' yes .
farren 's has a delicious , mouthwatering burger that puts others to shame .
it 's that good .
unless you 're a vegetarian , or kosher or hindu .
then you can refrain from the slapping , and just glare in frustration .
fries are tasty too , but relatively standard fare .
i finally ventured past the delicious burgers and tried the elaine 's salad .
i have to say i was disappointed .
delicious burgers !
the buffalo wings were decent , but not fantastic .
have tried two desserts there- a carrot cake and a lemon pie .
bottom line : fantastic burgers .
get a burger and a beer and you wo n't be disappointed .
the scallop salad is to die for .
onion rings , tri-colored chips , fries and great salads .
the restrooms can be nasty and are shared with a couple of adjoining restaurants .
love this place .
staff is great .
food is great .
place is great .
i normally get the black bean tacos and love them
their food is awesome !
that earns respect from me on two levels - _num_ .
you can see into the kitchen !
and they are very knowledgeable about their food and their beer , etc ...
happy booze and burger-ing !
cheers
this is my favorite restaurant in champaign !
i always get a bacon burger and it is amazing .
i have never had a burger under or over cooked .
the fries are always good .
i also love their beer menu .
i have brought friends , family and girlfriend , with no complaints !
parking is not an problem with the parking deck right next door .
best burgers in c-u .
they also have an amazing molten chocolatey dessert .
and , i 've always had excellent service .
we love farren 's for it 's off-the-beaten-path location and unexpectedly good food .
you could say we 're regulars .
my wife always gets the strawberry and walnut salad .
it 's delicious .
fortunately for me , she can never finish it .
very good beef and salmon burgers .
fresh food , good service .
not loaded with smelly college kids either !
a great find .
fresh brewed iced tea always nice .
_num_ ) the food was absolutely delicious .
_num_ ) kobe beef burger ?
yes !
tried farren 's out for the first time last night and wow .
the burgers were a bit pricey but quality was very good .
the key lime pie is also a must-have .
the food is sooo good .
but it is more then a pub .
kobe burgers !
chicken and veal sausage specials !
diver scallops some times !
interesting and changing wine selections .
i hate beer , but i hear they have a great selection .
i also really like the service .
they are accommodating , and you will wait for nothing .
the leaving with a laugh way .
this is my favorite .
go there now and have a good burger .
now ! !
!
excellent food , and very friendly service .
one of my favorite places in town .
it satisfies the `` hard-core '' hunger..making my mouth water even now .
the service is straight forward , rapid and no-questions asked cooperative .
very cool place .
wow , the best food in downtown champaign !
i guess the meat was kind of dry .
i really do n't get what the big deal is with this place .
this place is over rated .
pretty darn good .
they use interesting local ingredients ( lemon chive potato salad was awesome ) .
right now they have a special on krusovice , a great czech pilsner .
service is fast and friendly at the bar .
this has improved somewhat .
good luck .
the suffix `` feel '' was a little generous , i thought .
because that 's what you 'll get in this poorly ventilated basement .
( at least that 's the best excuse i can think of . )
burnt-out lights .
chipped paint on the walls .
a mysterious traffic light .
given all this , the $ _num_ entrees on the specials menu were surprising .
not so .
the specials menu continues this high standard .
to top it off , service was poor .
everyone seemed nice , but improbably busy with things that did n't involve customers .
i can only attribute the positive yelp reviews to heavy drinking .
you have been warned .
the kobe beef burger was probably the best burger i 've ever had .
it was so tender and juicy .
it 's the best burger in cu and regularly wins awards for it .
it was hard to taste much the rest of the day .
my personal favorite is the fish and chips , which runs $ _num_ .
to me , it makes no difference .
i would suggest a fountain drink or a beer .
service was friendly and astonishingly quick .
salad came back in probably under _num_ minutes from the time i ordered it .
so that was good .
and the salad tasted great .
so why am i giving this place three stars ?
the salad looked horrible .
and the pink dressing on top of it did n't help .
and then toss the salad to mix in that pink dressing .
so seven of us gave it a try for lunch today .
cauliflour was a bit underfried .
wings were ok .
very nice .
thick burger , but not a bit dry .
soft bun .
obviously come here for the burger !
!
my burger came with a side of tortilla chips for around $ _num_ .
upcharge to get fries or up-upcharge for sweet potato fries or the potato chips .
basement feel , schmasement feel ... it is a bar .
cool how the bathrooms connect you to nearby thai and sushi restaurants .
farren 's pub & eatery is has a casual type of atmosphere .
their burgers here are so delicious and juicy !
i 'm almost getting hungry right now just thinking about it .
hands down , the best burger in the area .
large , hand-pattied , and well-seasoned !
tastes like a homemade grilled burger without all of the fuss .
the feel of the restaurant is cozy , the beer prices are good .
the service is very friendly and everyone seems happy to be there .
this is definitely a regular in my restaurant rotation !
farren 's is one of my favorite restaurants in town .
the hamburgers here are very thick , so make sure you 're hungry !
very juicy burgers !
probably one of the best burger joints in the champaign-urbana area .
great burgers but i go for the chicken tacos for lunch .
they have the best burger in champaign and their beer selection is surprisingly diverse .
the burgers and salads are wonderful .
great service , and cozy atmosphere .
i love going to farren 's for lunch .
i usually get the steak salad , which is excellent .
greatest burger around .
super atmosphere .
we were able to sample a beer before ordering .
i will definitely go back .
best burgers i have ever had , probably .
or at least the burgers that all other places are judged by .
the russell is amazing ...
looking for great ambience ?
look elsewhere .
give me a russell or a motherlode with fries .
delicious .
there is often the option of texas kobe beef or bison for the burger .
both great .
onion rings quite good , too .
decent beer selection .
the staff has been friendly .
perhaps next visit .
i 'm new to champaign and heard a lot about farren 's .
my boyfriend and i have been there many times .
we love the relaxing and hipster atmosphere .
the service is great -- everyone is genuinely friendly .
the food is excellent .
overall , a great local place you should try .
it 's all pouring oil out the wazoo .
i got to say the service is exceptional though .
prices are reasonable too .
yes , it 's in a sort of a basement almost .
it 's just far too greasy for me .
this is a great hole in the wall place .
it is n't the easiest to find if you have n't already been there .
they have a lot of good food and the service is very courteous .
staff is friendly .
large selection of alcoholic beverages .
good food .
good prices .
stop by if you get the chance .
to be honest , i was a little disappointed .
def a hole in the wall worth going to ! !
!
good food , hard to find , decent beer .
this is an excellent upscale pub food place that was a go-to in c-u .
i had the bacon feta blue cheese burger and it was terrific .
fries .
onion rings and chips were all great .
service was very good .
thank you farren 's !
never had a bad meal since then , though .
i absolutely love farren 's !
i always order the steak salad ... every time !
this is one great steak salad !
i could eat one every day if i could afford it .
the service is always fast as well ... even during their busy lunch rush !
it 's a bit on the pricey side , but well worth it !
the salad is loaded down with steak .
sirloin , i think .
grilled onions and mushroom , drizzled with a heafty ranch dressing .
not watered down like some places .
finally , it 's topped with big chunks of blue cheese !
awesome !
great burgers ! ! !
definitely a place to try and go again and again !
i liked this place .
it 's nothing fancy , just a nice burger joint .
i loved the fries .
all in all a very tasty meal .
i do n't let myself go to farren 's often .
here 's an example of my average inner monologue during a farren 's visit .
it might help shed some illumination as to why :
`` farren 's !
yay !
oooh , beer list .
oooh , beer i 've never had !
order beer . ''
*beer consumed*
`` ooh , menu !
what ?
housemade chips ?
with truffle salt ?
hey !
fried portabello - battered , deep-fried and served with ranch ? ? !
yay appetizers !
i should have another beer ... ''
*beer consumed*
`` burgers !
with bacon !
and bleu cheese !
and mushrooms !
yaaay ! ''
farren 's is awesome .
the service has always been friendly and prompt .
and the immense discomfort of feeling like i could possibly literally explode .
how did i spend $ _num_ at farren 's ?
i thought we split checks that night ... oh ... we did . ''
best burgers in cu .
really hope to go back before i graduate .
this is the epitome of a hole in the wall restaurant with great food .
the service is great , always friendly and very efficient .
farrens , to say the least , has become a home-away-from-home .
anytime someone is looking for a good beer , i direct them here .
this is definitely a champaign must !
the sum-up : pub food at it 's finest .
we 're new to the area and have heard good things about farren 's .
i also decided to splurge and get the fresh-made potato chips .
the staff was friendly and the food came out fast .
they were warm and the truffle salt was genius on these chips .
we will absolutely be back to farren 's and would bring the kids along .
this place is gold !
yay !
these burgers are ridiculous .
no one else comes close .
so , went here on a busy saturday night .
for burgers that cost around $ _num_ , i would expect a lot more .
hidden gem of c-u .
free parking in parking garage next door .
burgers , beer , fries .
top _num_ burgers .
this is the 2nd time to this place in about _num_ years time .
the siblings and i came here to visit after they arrived in town .
i did n't eat anything tonight as i 'd eaten earlier .
they all had fabulous food .
i shot photos of most all the food .
there was two salads a black bean veggie burger and a mother load burger .
there was fresh cut fries and chips .
everybody loved the food , the atmosphere , and drinks .
great time .
best burgers in cu .
everything else on their eclectic menus also pretty rocks the most .
that will be all .
update !
best burgers in town , in my opinion .
they 're toasty brown and delicious , especially when doused with malt vinegar .
they also have a full bar and great apps , specials , and desserts .
i sometimes just get the hummus plate app for dinner .
and the fish n chips special is pretty darn good for being land locked .
the environment is very laid back and the restaurant is fairly dim .
hands down the best burgers in champaign-urbana .
they also have an excellent beer selection that varies from visit to visit .
the burgers were just as good as i remembered .
one of my favorite places in town .
) , the black bean burger , and any of their regular burgers .
if fish and chips is on the special menu i get that .
with winter comes their chili which i can never get enough of .
the beer selection is always superb .
ate here early sep-12 .
had n't been in over a year .
why did i wait so long ?
got the russell burger and it was delish .
got chips and salsa instead of fries .
very grateful to be able to do something other than fries .
you can tell they are committed to having the best burgers in town .
a tiny little bar/restaurant in a basement basically .
a bar runs a long the back , with tables scattered .
very cozy .
the service is usually pretty good .
they do the best they can when the place is slammed .
six quality beers on tap , much more in bottles .
so they got the good beer covered .
full bar as well .
the food is great .
some of the best pub grub in town .
of coarse the burgers are what they are known for .
which are great .
the salads are also really good .
a great place to come for a beer and a meal .
great place for burgers , salads , casual dining .
service has always been friendly and efficient .
long beer list , though no heineken .
parking in massive city garage right next door .
usually busy , though i 've never waited long .
`` farren 's has the best burgers in town . ''
best burger in town ! ! !
prices are not too expensive , though a bit higher than campus town .
recommended !
i enjoyed their veggie burger .
it came with a cajun remoulade - yum !
they had a decent selection of drinks ( wine , beers , spirits ) .
the location is a bit strange - sort of in a back alley .
i almost missed it !
the burgers are indeed quite good !
we had a green chile cheese burger and a mushroom swiss cheese burger .
lots to choose from on the menu.. burgers , sandwiches , salads .
two words : bison burger .
got the chipotle bison burger .
cooked perfectly and one of the best burgers i have ever eaten .
finally went here after hearing how good it was .
overall , i was pleased .
i 'm a firm believer that burgers can only be so good .
that being said , these guys make a pretty good burger .
i got a bacon burger with bleu cheese crumbles .
i found it odd that the default side is tortilla chips .
it was fresh-tasting and not too spicy .
beer selection is good .
they had about _num_ beers on tap and a healthy list of bottles .
prices were n't too bad either .
i 'd come here again , for sure .
it 's a nice atmosphere .
everything is right there .
definitely recommend giving it a try !
wildly overrated .
it 's nothing special , neither good nor bad .
i tried it twice , it underwhelmed on both occasions .
maybe i 'm missing something ...
went here with a group of friends and had a very pleasant experience .
wait staff was prompt and inviting .
will definitely come back
whoa , mama , was that a delicious burger .
the crazy thing ?
that 's ok , he had spunk .
a little place tucked away in an alley ?
it 's worth a try , right ?
i went here with a group of friends on a friday night .
the fries were delicious .
) , but we had no problems still getting our correct checks .
the burger was really good .
the service was n't good .
best food i 've had in c-u thus far .
went on a friday night in october with my sister .
had a burger that was covered in pulled pork , bacon , and cheese .
amazing .
( a heart attack waiting to happen , but so good ! )
my sister had a chicken pesto wrap thing that was also fresh and yummy .
great seasoned fries .
good bottled beer selection .
i 'll be back !
caroline and her staff are the best !
i have never felt more comfortable and welcome in any restaurant !
the food is consistently amazing and the specials are always outstanding .
!
that stuff is fantastic , and totally worth every extra penny .
beer selection is okay , and they rotate stuff throughout the year .
staff is also very nice .
still an excellent place to go .
great food .
cool atmosphere .
service was slow .
farrens may not have the fanciest atmosphere , but the burgers are great !
the fries are made from real potatoes , the service is very kind .
you can tell that they use high quality ingredients .
so tasty !
fries are pretty standard , but burgers are fantastic .
be cautious of the red hair waitress ! ! ! ! !
and what came next is what made me determined not to visit any again .
in conclusion , mediocre food and worst service in campaign area .
exceedingly mediocre experience .
am i in the right place ?
poor beer , wine and food selection ( as in no selection ) .
we tried the fried ravioli which were served on a bed of wilting lettuce .
then why exactly am i paying upwards of $ _num_ for this frozen bullshit ?
tortilla chips come standard and it 's extra for fries ? !
cmon .
no pink in sight .
farrens is a great place to eat !
the burgers are top notch !
the salad just finishes the meal .
a must try in champaign !
my favorite burger in town , especially with a side of bleu cheese sauce .
chips and fries are both made in house and are pretty good .
onion rings do n't come close to the cost .
fish has been okay .
i wish they had better bread for everything .
some of the waitstaff are just jerks .
`` hey , can i have an extra bleu cheese sauce , please ? ''
`` you already have one . ''
`` yes .
i would like another . ''
giant eyeroll and _num_ minutes to get it , despite the empty bar .
there are a lot of other places to eat in cu .
solid burger .
they must use a propane or gas to grill inside , though .
about the food -- the burgers are as good as any i have had .
bad choice .
next time i will take the calories and the fries .
they were great .
good quantity and quality .
served , as i recall , with a very tasty salad .
again , very good quantity and very tasty .
about the service - it was lunch time .
the place gets very busy .
the staff hustles .
they run thru the maze of tables .
they get everything right and maintain a cool composure .
they are friendly and go out of their way to be helpful .
i do n't give many five star reviews , but this place deserves it .
came here on a packed saturday night with a group of _num_ people .
we were seated after a good 20-minute wait .
it was probably an hour between us entering the door and getting our food .
the secret to an enjoyable burger-eating experience ?
a good meat-to-bun-ratio and a manageable stack .
but tortilla chips come standard with the burger , instead of fries ?
what were they thinking ?
it 's slightly on the pricey side but you wo n't be disappointed .
hands down- farren 's is awesome !
i always order the steak salad and my girlfriend has the scallop salad .
both are huge and loaded down with meat .
service can be a little hectic , but great food at good prices .
check it out ! !
!
food is always top notch .
the only thing keeping me from _num_ stars is the service .
wow .
she may as well have said `` you 're not welcome here .
go away ! ''
so , we turned and left .
frankly , i 'm not sure when we will go back .
so farrens ?
not so much .
: p
seriously .
best burgers in town .
the black burger is bomb !
was n't quite the same , but it was still very tasty .
the burgers are n't the only good part .
they have daily specials that have always been satisfying and unique .
they also have some stellar dark beers .
only fries in champaign i can have with my soy , gluten allergy .
and they are amazeballs !
fresh cut potatoes fried in canola oil ... yes please !
i 'm enjoying an order now .
them burgers is huge , boy .
and tasty !
way better than a royale with cheese ! .
or a big kahuna burger .
i do love the taste of a good burger .
i love the open atmosphere .
its slightly pricey , but the food is well worth it .
and the fries .
the fries !
and it 's a wonderful difference .
best burger in champaign hands down !
farren 's has an awesome burger .
the patty was very thick and juicy , and the buns were fantastic .
i will definitely be coming back here again .
this place is great .
favorite bar food in all of cu !
also , my favorite burgers .
anything with blue-cheese and/or bacon is a winner .
it does have its quirks , though .
i was desperate to try this place .
the host was warm and welcomed us in .
there was some sort of roux sauce on the side that was equally phenomenal .
neither of these were so great .
they were a bit gamey .
but i 'll never forget you , my black bean .
one of my favorite places to eat out in cu .
they have a solid draft selection as well as a well-rounded menu .
the spicoli is the first-timer 's go-to .
however , i personally like it a little hot .
you 'll see what i mean when you get there .
their *real* [ emphasis on that ] ginger ale is real .
seriously .
burns like a mother , but still good . )
i 'm not quite sure about the appetizers .
but , it 's definitely not a bad price .
mood : a little dark .
has more of a darker , but cheerful , environment compared to other bars .
service : i found the service to be good .
other comments : definitely recommended to visit at least once .
the russell is a must have .
i recommend getting it with a kobe patty .
service was great , very attentive even if they were swamped .
will definitely visit again and get something that is easier to enjoy .
farrens is not easily located as the entrance is down an alley .
the waiters were knowledgeable and friendly , but not overbearing .
pretty much upon entry i was congratulated for finding the place .
i think that is what helped me !
this place is super casual .
i am so glad i copied him .
this salad was sooo good .
mixed greens .
sweet fruity dressing , tasty scallops .
walnuts .
strawberries .
grapes .
also make sure you get the crackers that come with the salad !
apparently , their burgers are good too ... . maybe next time !
love me some farren 's .
always considered one of the best luncheon spots in downtown champaign .
from the perfect hand cut fries to the over the top burgers .
hamburgers are their specialty , with the `` russell '' as their house style .
im gon na sum this up quickly .
booooo ! ! ! !
and i smell like a resturant !
ugh !
wo n't go back nor will i suggest anyone go there .
delicious burgers !
glad i finally got to try this place .
the burger did n't disappoint .
got the spicoli .
bacon , mushrooms , onions and cheese .
need i say more ?
it was so flavorful !
the burger was perfectly cooked too ( generous amount ... ) .
i was so full .
got the fries ( you pay extra for these ) .
the fries were good too .
amazing burgers , had once would go again except the wait was pretty long .
many will tell you this is the best burger in town .
you will miss it if you are not looking for it .
fries are very tasty .
service is good .
prices are a little steep for a burger .
solid place
based purely on service .
.
.
horrible , maybe burgers are good , but i do not like being ignored .
great food , very local small town feeling in there .
the elaine salad is so yummy i definitely recommend it .
you ca n't go wrong with a burger here .
their beer selection is a little limited i think .
on a weekend night there 's usually a line if you arrive after _num_ .
but it 's great that way .
give me a break .
i wish this place was a `` locals only '' hidden gem ...
great salads for anyone looking to have somethings a little lighter .
the hostess is terribly rude and nasty .
the seating is horrible .
the last time i was there the food was good but really slow .
our party left without being served .
terrible customer service .
whenever you want a good burger , go to farrens .
you 'll never be dissatisfied because that 's their main thing .
they have put thought into their menu , and their burgers are cooked perfectly .
the beer selection is good .
the atmosphere is noisy .
the wait is about 20-30 min on weekends .
like many places in chambana the menu does n't change from year to year .
if you 're calorie conscious take half of your burger home like i do .
farron 's should be a destination for everyone in central , il .
very good food , cozy little place , kinda difficult to find .
not for folks in a hurry but worth it for those who wait
this is the place to go to get burgers !
the place has such a personality , given the house chips and hole-in-the-wall-osity .
i 'm craving it already .
their kobe burger is filled with fun flavor .
the portabello mushroom dish is actually two large fried mushrooms .
it can be a tad difficult to get the waiters ' attention sometimes though .
definitely a place for yummy burgers !
trust me .
i detected some truffle flavor which i turn a nose on .
the standard side of tortilla chips was pretty decent as well .
i counted only a couple servers but they were great and helpful .
this may just be my favorite place to eat in c-u !
the staff has always been really friendly too !
first time here..great atmosphere .
i love farrens .
great burgers .
the fries are ok. service is usually decent .
price is a little high but i think it 's worth it .
the appetizer of scallops are great !
!
really really solid .
plus they always have a decent and unexpected on-tap beer selection .
this is slowly becoming a favorite go-to place .
well , the rumor was certainly confirmed .
it 's nothing fancy and probably does n't want to be .
everyone ordered a burger and we got the homemade chips for an appetizer .
these were good and a pretty large portion too .
the burger itself was large and very well put together .
french fries were really tasty , too !
my only minor qualm with the place is the service .
this other server ( maybe a manager ? )
strongly recommend , 4/5 !
great great burgers .
kobe burger cooked to chefs liking was perfect .
i 've been here _num_ days and had dinner there twice .
i 'll eat there the next _num_ nights with confidence .
the food here is always top notch !
its just as good as anything i 've had in new orleans .
always satisfying .
neat location/atmosphere .
the burgers and hand cut fries are amazing .
also some of the friendliest staff in town .
definitely going to come back if i 'm back in champaign .
easily the best burgers in cu .
i have eaten here more times than i can remember .
i would honestly pay double for the burger and still be happy .
great small hidden gem of downtown champaign with parking all around .
the burger and fries i had at this place were delicious !
great food , average service , poor atmosphere .
the place is cramped and they are understaffed .
i feel like more people in champaign should be talking about farren 's .
the food is well ... american .
really great place overall .
you owe yourself to give it a try .
fantastic food , enjoyed the small resturant over big chain .
service was good as well .
highly recommend this restaurant ! !
waited said they were just voted one of the best burger joints in town .
the burger i had at this joint was amazing .
it was a terribly crowded feeling .
but the food was excellent , there 's no doubting it .
delicious food .
delicious beer .
just delicious .
we had the fire burger and the russell burger .
happy bellies ! ! ! !
highly recommend ! ! !
!
farren 's is the definition of a hole in the wall restaurant in champaign .
note : your whole party has to be present in order to be seated .
this is due to their limited space .
everyone got their food in about _num_ minutes .
i ordered the veggie burger and the homemade chips .
i ate everything on my plate .
the price is a little steep compared to other burger places .
i believe that it is worth it .
the noise level is higher than average because it is such a small place .
do n't let that stop you .
go to farren 's !
you wo n't be disappointed .
fantastic hand cut fries and gourmet burgers in downtown bar and grill atmosphere .
worth the wait for a table .
great service .
the food and service was exceptional .
i ordered a strawberry salad and it was phenomenal .
however , i will still be returning .
nice atmosphere , the food was typical american pub grub .
they get busy and i understand that but sometimes too slow .
the best burger place in illinois .
the burgers are cooked to perfection and the onion rings are too good .
it is in a weird location but i guess it works .
you have to go here !
burgers are awesome ( and huge ) .
staff is always friendly .
holy burgers batman ! ! ! ! !
!
you might lie to yourself and say you will only eat half .
haha .
good luck with that .
this is probably the best burger i have even had .
and i do n't say that lightly .
the servers are running around and helping everyone at once .
out server was super nice and very stylish to boot .
i had a motherload .
and oh it was .
i hit the jackpot .
do yourself a favor and plan to not eat dinner and eat lunch here .
i 'm just gon na say it : the best burgers in town .
shall i compare thee to a summer 's day ?
i am honestly obsessed with farren 's .
the burgers are phenomenal .
i ca n't say how much i love this place enough .
bacon cheeseburger-yum !
excellent bean burger for my lunch mate as well , terrific service !
just do n't expect fancy decor and you 'll be good !
i ordered it.medium rare .
it was a.dry juiceless burger.well done for sure .
i repeatedly try this place but they.get.it right only.1 out if _num_ times .
service is.slow.and indifferent when owner isnt.around .
perhaps the definition of a gem .
pretty well hidden , overlooked , but absolutely wonderful .
their burgers are unmatched .
it quickly became a favorite for me and the guys .
i ca n't deny that it 's a complete hole in the wall place .
but honestly that 's part of why i love it .
farren 's is fantastic , do n't miss it .
super amazing burgers ! !
i had the regular with blue cheese sauce ! ! !
it was delicious ! !
definitely going again ! !
!
amazing burgers !
their ground beef is unreal .
it 's a disservice to the burger to put ketchup on these badboys .
they cook them well-done , and still they 're juicy and tasty !
my favorite is the spiccoli , it 's swiss , mushroom and onions .
fantastic !
as good as advertised .
burger was great , and the service was friendly .
my brother convinced me to eat downtown instead of going out for indian .
since i love burgers , he suggested that we go to farren 's .
i have heard a number of good things about farren 's so i agreed .
i was so surprised when we walked up to the building .
i like holes in the wall , but boy is this one .
there was a short line when we came in .
i ordered the spicoli without mushrooms and added the blue cheese topping .
so that is what i ordered .
the burger was very good , but needed more bacon .
they were a tad bit overcooked .
i do find the place to be a bit dirty .
the floor just felt oily underneath my feet .
the bathroom was ick .
and worn .
advice : eat quickly and get out .
these burgers are absolutely amazing !
all of them rocked !
they were huge , fresh and juicy .
we got fries with them and could not come close to finishing it all .
the fries were really good too , not too greasy or salty .
the guys working there were all super friendly and casual .
wonderful food , fantastic laid back service ... .this place is great !
best burger in champaign hands down .
if you are a vegetarian the veggie burger is a must try !
my boyfriend absolutely loves this place .
i 'm a little indifferent .
last night , i had the veggie burger .
i was sure to ask for all the extra fixings .
even so , they were still a little skimpy on the tomato .
i wish they had dijon mustard - only plain yellow mustard is available .
boy was i jealous he can enjoy red meat this much !
beef lovers would give this place _num_ stars easily .
so , the lady 's sister hit a car in a parking lot somewhere .
name places ... all no , finally `` farrens ? ''
and it 's a yes .
we decide to meet there at 6:30 .
drive from the country into town , and exit at neil street from _num_ .
we park , and walk to farrens .
!
we go down the ramp into farrens .
i make eye contact with the server he points to a table .
no one else sees him point to the table .
and i 'm like ... do you know who i am ! ! !
( seems to be a recurring theme , that triptych stuff is everywhere ) .
i order a beer on draft , the lady orders a beer on draft .
the sister asks `` do you only have that craft stuff on draft ? ''
she gets , i think , a coors light .
how can you drink mass produced beer with craft food ?
kridz orders the mozzarella sticks .
i get the portabella mushroom appetizer .
the moz sticks are moz sticks .
nothing too fancy ( it seems ) about them .
hell , this thing is practically a meal to itself .
bacon on everything ! !
!
if this is on the menu , get it .
grease ? ''
and i 'm like `` uh ... that 's butter '' .
then they are like `` who puts butter in their mac an cheese ? ''
butter makes everything better , as does bacon .
mmm bacon butter .
i finish my burger .
i have blue cheese sauce throughout my mustache and beard .
thus is the struggle i deal with .
a drippy delicious burger , all throughout the beard .
i have another beer .
everyone else finishes eating .
so , it took _num_ months but i finally gave farren 's another shot .
we walked in and asked for a table for two .
i was astounded at her attitude .
farren 's is the prototypical hole-in-the-wall establishment .
but every time i go there , it 's packed to the door .
the food is amazing .
i love the green chile cheeseburger because it reminds me of home .
ask them to replace the pepper jack cheese with cheddar .
ask for extra salsa !
not good for a quick bite .
not open late .
be prepared to wait .
a party of two will be sat almost immediately at the bar .
any party bigger than that must wait .
the bacon cheeseburger was the best burger i 've ever had .
fries and soup were also very yummy .
i have had the bacon bbq chicken sandwich and the chips .
absolutely amazing ! !
i will definitely be going back !
flag down someone by waving and shouting ) then another 15+ to be seated .
they could at the very least greet their customers and let them know the
wait time .
even after we were seated it took forever to get
something to drink ( even after ordering drinks it took over _num_ minutes ) .
food , whenver they get around to bringing it .
nothing particularly good to say about the food .
it was fine , i guess , but why is it so expensive ?
location : kinda lousy , service : kinda lousy , food : kinda meh .
why bother ?
i mean it was n't bad , but ... .
now the burger .
i had the 'spicoli ' .
completely overrated .
the bun was dry , and cold .
oily top .
interesting .
great burger ! ! !
farren 's did not disappoint ! !
i had the `` russell . ''
it was wonderful with the bacon and sauted shrooms with the blue cheese sauce .
my wife had a the standard bacon cheeseburger with american .
it was very flavorful and just the right amount of peppery !
everything was exceptional ! !
the food was good , but not spectacular .
the portions are pretty hefty .
definitely will fill you up .
i got the russell burger with fries .
the fries were pretty good .
and my friend got the onion rings which were on point .
probably the best onion rings i 've had at uiuc .
for your money i think the place is great .
i would come back at not peak hours .
not that that makes them plain , by any stretch .
but just understand , that 's their focus and what they do best .
thumbs up to them for trying new things .
snappy service late one friday night .
plenty of drinks , and my soft drink got refilled post haste .
it 's not much for ambiance , except it nails the neighborhood pub ambiance .
the bar .
the one , simple dining room .
i love farren 's burgers .
i find them to be too salty .
they also have good salads , if you want some lighter fare .
best burgers in champaign-urbana !
i asked to return it and bring a well done .
when they brought another one it still was pink !
after our lunch both of us felt really bad .
and our stomachs felt sick ! ! !
definitely it was the last time that we chosen this place
i asked to return it and bring a well done .

yup , i 'm a fan .
solid burger , always cooked appropriately and always delicious .
the truffle chips are good , usually a few under-cooked ones that slip by .
if you want a fancy restaurant get the f out of a corn field .
after-all this is a bar , in a basement , in a college town .
they make good burgers .
the buffalo wings were amazing-crunchy , juicy , and meaty !
the house made bleu cheese we legit too !
our waiter was awesome and kept it real !
he recommended the russell burger which did not disappoint .
will definitely be back !
had the fire burger medium rare at lunch today with fries .
off-the-charts !
not to spicy for me , and i could have doubled the peppers .
i think i need to return and have the russell .
before 11:45 this place had a line at the door to be seated .
it is not a huge place , but we 'll worth any wait .
which burger you like best depends on your taste .
order the house-made fries for a side .
as for appetizers , we 've tried the buffalo wings with blue cheese dressing .
so , so good .
i 've sworn to get this every time i go back .
really : ) .
back to the good , we like the atmosphere at farren 's .
it 's got a relaxed , grown-up , neighborhood gastro-pub feel .
there 's no parking lot specifically for farren 's .
food : amazing , as always .
substituted the chips for fries and the $ _num_ was worth it .
portion size was big .
service : great !
always checked up on the table .
place : small cozy pub
consistently the best burgers in town !
good beer selection and homemade sides .
the 4/5 is due to size .
good food and relaxed atmosphere !
this is a great place for high quality food and a nice time .
their burgers are huge and they give you tons of fries .
you wo n't leave hungry .
if you want large portions of great food go here .
if you want dim lighting , few distractions , and nice seating go here .
had the russell burger with onion rings .
husband had the same burger with fries .
food was excellent and service was fast .
i ordered the grilled steak salad and have also had the grilled chicken salad .
both were big portions and filling , but mediocre quality meat and produce .
no fru fru at this place .
i really liked the burgers and the truffled chips were awesome , however ...
she grabbed some menus brought them the table sat them down and walked away .
never said a word never put down her phone .
apparently the phone conversation was more important than the customer .
worst service ever .
returned at suggestion of in-laws .
this time got sat , but service still leaves some to desire .
mostly empty , but _num_ minutes until we were sat .
maybe they are understaffed .
burger was great , fries were good and serving size was large .
the blue cheese tasted like ranch .
hate blue cheese , like the sauce .
similar burger and fries at murphys would be half that price .
_num_ stars for food
_num_ stars for value
_num_ stars for service
what 's not to love ?
when you just need some red meat , come here for a yummy burger !
the worker over there is rude ! !
omg ! !
what kind of customer service is this ?
!
this place has the worst service ever .
when you have people being served cups of ice cream give them a spoon .
ordered coffee and server was going to add sugar/cream .
that is my coffee and i will add that .
this place is in need of training help .
i ca n't wait for jarlings to open : ( .
worst place ever !
excessive ?
i know .
oh boy was i excited ! !
( can you say cheat day ? ! ? ? ? )
the place was pretty clean .
i got a double scoop in a waffle cone for about $ _num_ .
!
no ! ! !
!
dunkin donuts iced coffee is cheap and rad .
this location is convenient and is hardly ever busy .
too expensive for what it is .
the ham was just awful and there was way too much cheese .
i will certainly never go back for a breakfast sandwich .
hehe .
i love dunkin ' donuts .
located along a major thoroughfare for the city and near campustown .
the donuts are pretty good .
quick service .
however , not all the donuts are in stock at a given time .
i appreciate having someplace to grab a snack with early morning black friday shopping .
i love the dunkin on green and neil .
i stop by for coffee on twice a week before an evening class .
there is one lady that i always see and she is super friendly !
friendliest dunkin in town !
they got my business from ine of their competitors simpky by being so nice .
the donuts here taste stale and the employees are n't the most welcoming people .
this location seems to be out of the donuts i want consistently .
this place is really fast with their drive thru service and their indoor service .
i enjoy getting the $ _num_ coffee .
their breakfast items are good .
i like their egg and sausage croissant .
dunkin donuts coffee is best enjoyed with cream and sugar .
no bike rack , so brought bike in .
did not allow it and could not offer an alternative location .
usually go in car , but no more .
as i write this i 'm at panerai having a tastey bagel sandwhich .
the donuts are stale monday-saturday .
sundays they are fresh .
why do they keep putting them out ? ? !
love the $ _num_ coffee and the egg and cheese croissants .
the service was great and the treats were too !
they served us quickly and with a smile .
they even offered us some free donuts since they were about to close .
i was pleasantly surprised at such great service this late at night !
i have had several pairs of pants hemmed here .
always an apology and a request to come back tomorrow .
they also take forever !
they said it would be a week .
i gave yong 's a delicate shirt to repair .
what 's that lesson ?
do n't go to yong 's !
we discussed the repair and what i did n't want them to do .
my shirt was ruined and it could n't be undone !
unlike the poster below i did n't find them particularly polite or apologetic .
unfortunately i also think that language is a barrier .
yong 's revived my favorite pair of skinny corduroy pants ! !
; ) ) .
i have taken everything from topcoats to pants here and never had a problem .
period .
i have worked with yong 's for about _num_ years .
fantastic people , quality work !
jacket sleeves were shortened , stitching came out within a week .
nuf said
had my greek letters embroidered on a couple of my own personal items .
good service .
the great impasta has some extremely rich and luscious food .
paintings and candles accent a ceiling painted with grapevines .
the chef tries hard to incorporate lots of ingredients from local farms .
to make the experience perfect , the service i had was absolutely wonderful .
highly recommended .
second basket of bread , full water glasses , suggestions about drinks .
even the clientele was less offensive than average .
that is extremely rare on our friday nights in downtown cu .
it 's honestly pretty good .
the service is attentive without being obnoxious .
the fresh , hot bread is always good .
excessive grease is used .
also , avoid goin on the thursday nights .
they have a stupid live band .
they also wont accomodate any dietary restricitions .
go to perkins instead ( if you have dietary restrictions )
or biaggi 's ( reserve online if you hate waiting + want good food )
the service is attentive but not obnoxious , and the bread is always great .
i like to be able to *see* my food .
the great impasta is fantastic .
i heard that this restaurant is closing soon .
so my coworkers and i went to try it out .
their lunch menu has excellent selections .
the service is exceptional as well .
definitely one of champaign 's best .
great decision .
do n't try it at home ) .
whatevs .
i 'll run tomorrow while hating my new waist size .
go while you can .
the food is good , the bartenders amenable , the staff fantastic .
go now .
log off the damn computer , hop a flight if you have to .
i 'll even pick you up from willard airport if i have to .
aw im sad .
they joined in and kept up !
and the food is solid , save the strogonoff .
i had the eggplant napoleon and it was deeelish !
do n't leave impasta , i love you .
i used to love the great impasta .
it was my restaurant of choice .
if there was a night out to be had , it started here !
however , as time went on , the food quality slowly started to slip .
they stopped warming the bread before bringing it to the table .
the service started getting harder to find .
i loved this place in the beginning , but sadly had to say farewell .
update : 6/20 .
i thought i 'd give the impasta another try .
they were lifeless , unappealing and bland .
no bread , no water , no hello , nothing .
as we left , we were stopped .
however , too little , too late .
we wo n't be back .
i have been there for lunch .
they used to have good , homey , tasty food .
nothing of that is left , the memories barely .
of course , we expected a small piece of freshly cooked tuna .
my stomach did n't thank me .
my friend barely touched her salad , and returned it uneaten .
the staff behaved as if nothing was wrong .
bottom line : avoid like the plague .
my husband and i went with our families who were helping us move in .
when we arrived , we were promptly seated at our reserved table .
how was the food we actually ordered ?
bad .
no hint of bacon or wine or any aromatics like garlic or shallot .
my mother ordered the salmon , which came rare .
he told her `` it 's supposed to be that way . ''
you could n't pay me to go back .
i had the chance to eat here over dad 's weekend this past fall .
the food was overpriced for the level of quality .
to make matters worse , the lighting in place feels like stage spotlights .
i miss the old downtown champaign location .
the urbana restaurant lacks the charm and coziness that the great impasta once had .
update - finally went to the new lincoln square mall location .
sigh .
i recommended the place to my friends and we went there for dinner yesterday .
my friend and i had the saffron risotto and it was horrible .
it was n't creamy , in fact , it was soupy and bland .
the shrimp was overcooked and tough .
worse , i could n't even taste a hint of saffron .
needless to say we were not impressed .
another friend had the mushroom and asparagus linguine with prosciutto .
the pasta was of an unappetizing soft texture and the dish was overly greasy .
the prosciutto tasted more like salted pork .
their only redeeming feature was the crab cake appetizer .
i would go back , but get one of their good salads instead .
wine , and terrific service .
let me first preface my review with some background .
i have no such high expectations from the local `` eye-talian '' businesses .
anyway , i decided upon the great impostor , er , impasta .
tape ?
really ?
service was slow and perfunctory .
the meal started with bread , olive oil , and cheese for the dipping .
the oil seemed decent enough but the cheese was not parmigiano reggiano .
i ordered a glass of the house chianti , which was drinkable .
for my appetizer , i chose the sausage in crust .
the sausage was unremarkable and under-seasoned and the crust was bone dry .
the small side of greens was nicely dressed but rather limp .
the olives appeared to be sliced black olives from a can .
the linguine was cut so short that it defied twirling on the fork .
i indulged myself with dessert on this special holiday .
the latter was fine , the former was nothing special .
perhaps this seems a harsh review .
so it is with ethnic cuisine .
a lot just depends upon what you are used to .
slowest service i 've ever had in my life .
took _num_ minute for a waitress to come to our table .
it was n't even a waitress ...
the hostess was the one who helped us .
took _num_ minutes to get our food after we ordered .
spent _num_ hours in the place ... was n't even crowded .
food was good that is about it .
we asked for a discount and what did we get ... _num_ % .
we saved _num_ dollars after spending _num_ hours of our time there .
it pains me deeply to give the great impasta only two stars .
the food is a pale ghost of its former self .
the pasta is often over cooked .
the sauces which used to be very special have become indifferent .
had dinner there .
my friend ordered a daily special which contained salmon .
the salmon tasted very good - cooked just enough .
i had a chicken pasta .
it was okay .
i spent more than twenty dollar in total for my meal .
not worth that price though .
real traditional options .
food was amazing and service was exceptional .
original commitment to quality is key to success .
really loved their microstrone soup and their iced tea is pretty amazing ! !
friendly and fast too .
fast , friendly service at a great price .
really nice guy .
i went there today based on yelp reviews .
cool !
i dropped the car off and walked to golden harbor .
they just needed to be cleaned !
ha !
what a difference removing a little brake dust makes !
this , my friends , is great service !
worst service i have ever received at a subway .
this is the worst subway in champaign-urbana !
ewwwwwwww !
this store is ok .
it was not spicy and i had pepper jack cheese on it .
the chipolte sauce did not have any flavor at all .
i could taste the bread over everything else .
i will avoid this subway until they get this problem resolved .
i stooped in on my way home on a mon .
night at _num_ pm to pick up a sandwich .
the place was empty .
i ordered a tuna sub .
the nice guy behind the counter told me they were out of tuna salad .
and mayonnaise .
and onions .
he said the manager had n't ordered a supply truck for the week .
they will be out of those items until next week .
what kind of a manager is that ?
i ordered a `` specialty , '' a bmt .
i got it home and sat down to eat .
shortcuts .
clean and eugenia was very nice .
they were out of grilled chicken but there plenty of sandwiches to choose from .
no complaints from me .
`` no work trucks in parking lot ''
all of their stuff is clean , high-quality and youthful .
the frequent buyer/seller card does n't hurt either .
maybe if it were slightly bigger it could carry more ...
um , were we in the same plato 's closet ? ?
most of the stuff looked pretty cheap and teenybopperish to me .
i definitely have better luck at tj maxx for sure .
i 'll be honest with you .
i used to hate plato 's closet .
lately though things have changed .
i almost always find something great .
new employees ?
i do n't know but i 'm pleased .
it takes soooo much effort to find anything .
what everyone 's wearing from the mall .
overall though plato 's is n't a bad place .
that 's simply not true .
i 've seen plenty of great brands and unique pieces .
if you 're willing to dig there 's some great stuff here .
too many mall brand names that are just in bad taste .
i found a good navy p coat though for next to nothin though .
so , i will not give up on them just yet .
i usually stick to buying over selling .
they were clean and really professional .
seriously ?
i 'm also surprised by some of the negative reviews posted for new life .
i thought that everybody was really cool and professional .
i ca n't recommend this place enough .
the price was extremely fair , and i tipped him obscenely to compensate .
lunchbox is an awesome artist with a good sense of humor .
i love the atmosphere in here .
so really , there 's nothing else to say .
this is just the place to go .
he said this repeatedly throughout the conversation .
he just spent half an hour being kind of elitist .
the whole attitude was bizarre .
he confirmed that he was just talking about pre-nazi german swastikas .
i 'm pretty shocked by the reviews here .
i would n't dream of going anywhere else .
pretty cool !
also , they accept credit cards , but you should totally pay cash .
asshole credit card companies charge these guys way too much to use their service .
pay cash and go to new life !
cheers gents !
lunchbox is awesome !
great piercer and very sanitary .
otherwise , loved the vibe of the place .
looked through the tattoos while there , very creative and inventive pieces .
definitely check this place out , a central part to campus culture .
i also appreciate his honesty .
he does n't sugar coat anything , which is a trait i really appreciate .
i 've always felt so welcome here , and i highly recommend it .
lunchbox lives up to his reputation !
i would definitely go here again ( for my next tattoo ) !
okay , i 'm gon na give this place a _num_ start rating .
i went here to get an industrial piercing .
the guy who did it was really nice .
sounds good to me .
several months later i figured it was time to put the bar in .
it was a little hard to do , but i loved it .
gross , i know .
that was pretty disappointing to hear .
it 's a tough call on this place .
my boyfriend had both of his industrials done here and they 're great .
he also has two tattoos that look really amazing .
i just did n't have the best experience .
they are understaffed today , which is totally acceptable considering it 's spring break .
i will totally be going back for any other piercings i want .
dustin took care of us .
he was friendly and did an awesome job on my friend and me .
i will certainly go back .
lunch box is amazing !
i definitely recommend for all piercings .
very clean and professional .
we all love our tattoos !
!
lunch box is the go to guy !
i saw him do a tattoo on another friend .
my tattoo is great and im super happy with it !
i like _num_ hours away but its sooooooo worth the trip !
hes always friendly and funny as well !
very clean and over all a great experience !
went here to finish off my triple helix piercing .
i 'm not sure ) .
he marks my ears .
i go through with it .
he redid that one and was not understanding where i actually wanted the piercing .
by this time i was done .
well , it 's the next day and it looks like garbage .
i have n't heard anything back .
there is no way that i can go to work with this .
if i do end up getting a refund , i 'll update this .
i will never go back here .
i 'll stick with no regrets .
update : went back and got them redone .
what a douche bag .
probably going to take them out if they do n't completely heal by january .
i 'll go to no regrets this time .
i 've never had keloids ...
but that dude is beyond proud/stubborn .
avoid this dude at all costs .
my husband & i did a walk in .
it was my very first tattoo , he was not pressuring at all .
he walked me through the steps .
the place itself is very interesting .
art all over the walls and on the ceiling .
it was very very cool .
the minimum is $ _num_ which is great considering they are right on campus .
we would definitely return .
thanks again for the awesome service & tattoo .
just a small sputnik behind my ear .
i just walked in and he was able to do it quickly .
my most recent was done by michael t hastings .
every experience i 've had has been so positive .
i went to new life for my first tattoo based on the high reviews .
lunchbox did mine , he 's awesome .
super friendly !
they have a minimum charge of $ _num_ , but i highly recommend them !
someone told me this place has the best white russians in town .
the rose bowl is a dusty , hole-in-the-wall bar that nonetheless has charm .
it also has pitchers of pbr and oldstyle for cheap .
even more fun is the live music performed when i was there this week .
i ca n't believe that song is ten years old , weird .
anyway , nice divey spot .
i 'll be back .
the bar is dark and a little dusty .
there are a few video games and even a megatouch .
if you want a great laid back joint nearby , try bunny 's .
i 've only been to the rose bowl on one particular night , tuesday .
they have bluegrass music .
it 's always been fun , pitchers are cheap .
it 's dark and has a dive bar feel .
the only food available is tater chips .
this tavern is like chesney 's song `` when i see this bar ''
regulars and new comers alike feel at home here .
!
cheap pbr and trading of recipes from prison .
you ca n't handle the truth .
and lack any sort of smash that would make them worth paying for .
they do n't exactly melt in your mouth .
also , lack of free wireless makes academic types very sad .
fun place to stop for a treat if you 're trecking across campus .
i 've been to the urbana location twice .
the first time was so yummy i was ecstatic for the second .
oh well for an illinois treat : )
i love their chocolate selection .
i grew up on see 's candies , and moonstruck is definitely more fun .
they play with different flavors , different shapes , and different combinations .
i especially like their ice cream cone shaped candies .
and their coffee drinks are to die for !
$ _num_ for _num_ chocolates .
know what you 're getting into .
the drinks are worth trying but it is not great .
so , i ca n't study or do research while in there .
cute animals ... from elephants to donkeys.. pre-election .
which one are you ?
heck , if it 's yummy , i 'll be both !
their dark chocolate bars are pretty cheap and pretty yummy .
moonstruck is definitely not my cup of tea .
not cool .
moonstruck is a mixed bag of goodies for me .
on one hand , they have some amazing drinks , especially their hot chocolates .
oh , and no wi-fi .
they do have a very nice second floor , though .
but still , no wi-fi .
are coffee places even allowed to not have wireless anymore ?
bittersweet review..
i loved moonstruck ! ! ! !
i really missed having a chocolate cafe around when i left champaign..
that seemed kind of sudden !
i wonder what happened / what is going to go in there instead .
panera pleeeaaasssseeeee .
what ? ? ? ? ?
moonstruck is closed ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
that was my favorite date place ever !
i never want to go on another date again = (
you were overpriced and full of yourself ( really , charging for wifi ?
meh ) , but you left us too soon , moonstruck .
and your logo was cute .
: (
i 'm sad for you , but not particularly surprised .
i miss this place .
but only when it was `` bub 's . ''
loved those bub 's balls and happy hour euker games .
not that that is a bad thing for college .
; p
i just miss my little bub 's .
eeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
this place is only good for picking up dumb underage girls .
not worth it .
this place is unbelievably shit .
do not go there .
there are way too many underage drinkers .
it 's crowded .
and the staff never seems to remember who has wrist bands .
these guys do n't .
but nope .
they do n't .
all in all , it 's a shit bar .
do n't go there .
my favorite college bar and i did n't even go to college there .
red lion is where dreams come true .
cover charge ... why though ?
you do n't put drunk people on a stage without some precautions , guys .
most surfaces were wet .
rude crowd .
not a bad place , but not really `` good '' either .
slippery and dirty .
always drunk people standing on tables and spilling beer .
everything is sticky
honestly i would never go back to this bar .
the large wrap around bar means no lines .
maybe the bar owners will actually read some of this stuff ?
maybe flying pigs will abduct alma the night before finals ?
who knows ?
however , the place is pretty nasty .
yup , it 's that kind of place .
even when you do get served , it appears everything is really expensive .
$ _num_ for a bottle of miller lite ?
meh ... .
the inside bouncers/barbacks usually are n't too bothersome .
i really do n't know .
the outside bouncers/door guys are even more aggravating .
i now have a creased driver 's license .
thanks , red lion !
i might just have the secretary of state bill you for my next one .
phone number is incorrect .
great party/fratty bar .
always cover for any age and drinks are mediocre .
are you a fan of dancing on tables ?
loud , but good music ?
then this is the place for you .
drinks are cheap enough , but there 's a cover charge ...
dirtiest bar ever ! ! ! ! !
full of disrespectful and dirty kids .
this is one of the nicer taco bells that i 've ever been to .
they also make a nice triple steak burrito .
i am only giving two stars because of the drive through .
it is notoriously slow .
and there is no way to get out of line either .
this happens every time i use the drive through .
avoid !
i used the bathroom and found there was no soap !
food has always been ok but the soap issue is a deal breaker .
i elected not to order any food and left to go eat somewhere else .
how i miss wine night on tuesday nights !
it was always uber crowded on tuesdays and the music was always great !
i 'll always remember catching a glimpse of deron williams .
; )
i miss dollar corona night !
you really ca n't beat the price or the music .
my favorite crowd of any bar on any night .
not sure if they still have it .
probably because the bartenders wear button-downs and ties .
there is always a line at this place and there is always a cover .
wine night always meant a good time ( read : blacked-out drunkenness ) .
the themed parties were entertaining .
and there was absolutely enough room to dance at all times .
this is a place to see and be seen .
it could be a really classy place , but ... it is n't .
two words : wine night ! ! ! !
definitely the place to be on tuesday 's for $ _num_ bottles of wine .
much better alternative than kam 's and the like .
it gets crowded on the weekends and the building is actually pretty nice .
i like how it is set up .
no more dollar corona nights though ...
oh .
mah .
gawd .
classy , no ?
well .
i just went back for a visit , and they redid the place .
completely .
they serve food and there is a coffee bar in the front !
seriously , i was impressed .
old cly 's ?
i probably would have given it a _num_ .
hey , my 19th birthday was wine night .
the decor is great- cleaned up very nicely , looks really classy .
also ... is there draft beer ?
we did n't see any .
ok , so i went here on a busier night .
they have , however , added more tables , which is a plus .
so , everyone on the dance floor can see you while you wait .
sometimes guys knock .
awkward .
wine night - how i loathe/heart thee .
always a pretty long line to get in .
cover could be a bit high for a college bar .
this bar is definitely making a comeback .
they are also a coffee bar by day ?
wtf ? ?
might as well just let people sleep there .
but i guess they are one of the nicer ones now .
oh god .
clybourne 's = glorified undergrad house party .
oh , except this party also charges $ _num_ cover .
writing this review as i sit inside the floor-to-ceiling windows .
3:37pm - the cook just came out and punched me in the neck .
* turned out i knew him from high school .
apparently the barista went to high school with us too .
nothing like coming home for the holidays ...
* new decor , new dance floor , new seating , pretty awesome
* local djs who play decent dance music
* go here if you like to dance ( or at least attempt ) .
otherwise avoid .
* the drink specials are pretty awesome , especially tues and thurs
* the bartenders are cool , until a ton of people show up
* nice crowd , though it can get packed
this bar closed down in _num_ for renovation and reopened in spring _num_ .
and wow is there a difference .
the space has been optimized .
in fact , this bar seems designed for dancing .
but its clich done right .
i have to say that the bathrooms are pretty decent .
the drink specials are nice in my opinion .
tuesdays are wine night , where you can get bottles for $ _num_ .
thursdays are $ _num_ skyy/wild turkey and chaser night .
and even saturdays the pricing is decent .
there is n't very much selection , but welcome to campus bars .
you 'll have to go to downtown champaign for that .
you will pay $ _num_ cover from essentially weds to saturday night .
the clientele in there ranges from nerds to the simply fratastic .
girls that tend to frequent this bar seem to be pretty friendly to me .
if you want to avoid cover get here before _num_ .
4/5 stars .
there were several floors ; three to be exact from what i remember .
walk past that and you will hit the dance floor .
the bouncers do n't mess with you unless you give them reason to .
the crowd is very diverse and energetic .
the thing that struck me were the floors .
about two hours inside the club , the floors got really slippery .
overall a good experience .
lol !
that was my bad , whoops .
see you again soon cly 's !
the menu has plenty of choices for everyone .
there is a nice selection of appetizers , sandwiches , salads , and pizzas .
they also offer nice coffee drinks and university employees get a discount !
what 's better than that ?
one suggested clybourne .
no big lunch crowd made me wonder about the food and service .
well , both were great .
lots to choose from on the menu and the service is quick and friendly .
have been back several times and tried different menu items and always enjoyed .
try the irish nachos .
quite good .
i remember when coslow 's was around and they had them .
clybourne 's are excellent .
snobby and pretentious .
drinks are very weak .
too loud to hear anything .
floor is very slippery .
unfriendly doorman .
not a fan , at all .
joes has a better dance floor .
firehaus has more class .
_num_ .
long lines
_num_ .
cover charges
_num_ .
youngsters who ca n't handle their overpriced watered-down liquor
_num_ .
even longer restroom lines
_num_ .
listening to ridiculously-loud music while patrons `` dance '' , a.k.a .
`` dry hump '' .
bottom line :
seemed to be more upscale than other bars in the area .
this place is the best for dancing .
do n't get me wrong .
you need to be eight shots deep to enjoy this place .
this is a place for undergrads that want to get hammered and dance .
if you do n't like to dance , dont come .
its as simple as that .
you 're paying five dollars to stand and listen to really loud music .
this is also one of the few ethnically diverse bars on campus .
there 's a reason this line is so big every weekend .
clys has people of every race and very attractive ones at that .
the drinks are so-so , but i love the dancing here .
people are very ... unique and spontaneous with their moves .
it 's a great time for just $ _num_ cover on a weekend .
come with fun people and dance the night away .
; )
used to go their a lot because of the diversity of crowd .
like their music which is more hip-hop .
i effing hate this place .
of course , i was in grad school and not an undergrad .
i found the whole demographics off in this place .
all around sloppy .
pass .
smells like puke .
literally everything from floor to ceiling is somehow sticky and drink spillage was everywhere .
drinks are okay ... but just okay .
extremely poor staff .
racist behavior .
ugggh i hate this subway .
i agree , quite likely the worst subway on the planet .
the employees do not care _num_ % about you , or your order .
i 'd rather have a sandwich from the dining hall in all seriousness .
i agree with the previous two reviewers .
( breakfast subs are available from 7-11 )
silvermine next door is so much better .
this place is wonderful .
go here .
oh man , how my friends and i loved that .
i guess they were ordered to cease and desist by the recording industry .
there is no call to ever patronize a lackluster video .
rentertainment has what you want .
this location used to be a tiny little mom-n-pop grocery/convenience store .
i 'm probably the only person alive who remembers that .
you want it .
they most likely have it .
you can probably find leftovers still being given away in the store .
dvds are also for sale here .
so jealous of y'all cu-ites .
a venerable campus institution that has saved countless students from blockbuster and general boredom .
best video rental place ever .
period .
just walk through it once and you 'll understand .
oh and check out the best b-movie list .
that 's an amusing drunken evening just waiting to happen .
hell yes .
suck it , blockbuster - rentertainment til i die .
good stuff
_num_ .
greatest selection ever .
_num_ .
very knowledgeable , helpful and ... .ahem cute staff .

they have a computer hooked up to the internet in the store !

this place really spoils you .
you will never be able to use netflicks or blockbuster again .
http : //www.apple.com/itunes/store/movies.html
sue them ?
this is my favorite movie rental place of all time .
i moved away to chicago , but i miss this place .
they always had good music playing in it too .
so i caved and am jumping on the that's-rentertainment-is-awesome bandwagon .
lo and behold , totoro ! !
their foreign film selection is unsurpassed .
i have to echo all the praise for rentertainment that other have given it .
i miss it so much now that i have left champaign .
best place to rent movies ever .
i miss you , rentertainment !
best part - the $ _num_ tv show rentals .
every movie rental place should take a clue from this place .
yeah !
rock on rentertainment .
it 's the only home-video option in c-u for the non-brain dead crowd .
documentaries , foreign and indie films , anime - lots of great stuff .
the most extensive selection of movies i 've ever seen at a rental place .
and the bluray section is fantastic !
great selection of movies .
they are sometimes friendly , sometimes rude , and always very slow .
i am a movie buff and this place has it all .
i love this place ten fold .
the place has the total package :
rentertainment does and they are there to help .
the selection is huge .
here is a case where looks are deceiving .
ha !
your impression will change .
i was amazed how much can fit in the store .
it is impressive .
the staff are casual and nice .
at blockbuster or hollywood , i find that their service sucks .
at rentertainment you get caring people .
the rentals are very reasonably priced .
they offer packages and these packages offer killer savings .
they have a section for that .
the best video store in the world .
puts facets to shame .
they seem to have everything .
secondly ... its pretty cheap if you buy a renters block .
best place to get movies in champaign , hands down .
it 's kind of like a physical version of netflix .
they have got everything .
the selection is magnificent and the community aspect is highly unique among video stores .
one of the best local rental places in the area i 've been too .
also , a very convenient location on campus .
check this place out .
two yelp stars is expressed as `` meh .
i 've experienced better . ''
it 's old technology and it needs to die .
for champaign , these guys really have an outstanding collection of rare films .
in short
more pros
this store has the largest collection of tv-on-dvd ( my favorite section ! )
i 've ever seen .
they also have a large blu-ray section .
they are also the best value in town .
the have specials almost every day , and new releases are only $ _num_ .
more cons
if you 're accustomed to blockbuster-like video stores , you 'll find rentertainment cramped .
it 's a small space with dvds stacked floor to ceiling on every wall .
new releases and specials are easy to find in the front of the store .
however , the bulk of the collection are in tall , narrow aisles .
a large man or woman my feel uncomfortable in this section .
warning : the red meters are super-expensive and limited to _num_ minutes !
there is no delivery option , and of course no instant-streaming option .
bottom line
it 's simple to rent there and they always meet my needs .
with 35,000+ dvds , they have the best movie selection in town .
chambanites ,
you are lucky to have such a wonderful video rental store in-town .
rentertainment has a large and good selection of movies to choose from .
if you are desperate for the newest blockbuster , there is always redbox .
my advice is to sign up for a block and be bold .
totally worth it for the awesome selection though .
if you rent movies from anywhere else , you suck .
we know you have a car , you lazy bastard .
the best video store ever !
they have nearly everything and the employees are extremely knowledgeable and personable !
champaign-urbana is lucky to have this place .
prices are reasonable and certain genres are discounted on certain days .
i hope this place sticks around for a long time !
i love the play on the name ... . haha ha ... ..
i think it is great .
we have visited them many times and feel comfortable with their level of service .
i bought a block my freshman year .
$ _num_ dollars for _num_ movie rentals .
best decision ever .
and you will go through the entire thing in _num_ years .
rentertainment is the best deal bar none .
the best video store ever !
they have nearly everything and the employees are extremely knowledgeable and personable !
i recommend buying a block .
that makes the price lower and you can keep the movie longer .
they even gave me a free rental on my birthday !
this place is amazing .
renting here kicks netflix 's ass if you 're on campus frequently .
highly recommended .
i really miss having a place like this .
i 'm so glad this place is here !
this place is the best for rentals .
great for class projects .
i do n't recall exact prices , but they were always super cheap .
we are so lucky to have a place like this in town .
the people who work there are always nice .
very nice local business .
that 's rentertainment is the obvious answer .
my mom and i rented the whole 6-vhs ( i know ! )
the shock !
the horror !
we ran to the car and hightailed it over to that 's rentertainment .
if you like foreign films there is no other place , period .
favorite video store of all time .
their selection in just about every genre is incredible .
hands down the best video store around !
staff is super cool and helpful .
get a block of _num_ movies for $ _num_ !
i appreciate your collection .
but its too expensive .
i love this place !
definitely recommending getting a block .
the staff are kind and helpful
decent specials , but one of the more expensive bars on campus .
joe 's .
meh .
wtf ?
) , the drinks are overpriced , and the place is always super packed .
come here for happy hour and you 're set .
come here for happy hour on a thursday and you 're treated like royalty .
if it were n't for that alone i would n't come back .
one good thing is that the drinks are ridiculously cheap .
shots are $ _num_ , pitchers can be as low as $ _num_ .
hey girls- this review is written for you .
the employees were incredibly rude and were just standing in the ladies room .
it 's not worth it .
joes was a really fun place to go ...
when i was _num_ .
great dance floor and quite amusing watching girls try to pole dance .
nice employees .
they were young tho .
plus not a lot of college kids can drink dirty martinis nor order them .
being a grad student , i think the appeal is usually lost .
their food was typical and not memorable and the beer is only okay .
given the choice , i would choose other bars over joe 's .
however it 's a lot trashier in quality than brother 's .
for traditional patties , you have to choose a 1/4 or 1/2 pound burger .
pepper ) .
ew .
no thank you .
my friends came here to get burgers so i waited outside with them .
the waitress , i know not her name , was incredibly rude and inattentive .
hello , rude waitress .
nobody tipped , and the food was lukewarm by the time she served us .
we had to hound her to even pay for the meals .
what a horrible waitress .
she really should be fired .
yikes ... they really need to improve their service .
_num_ star ) .
hardly anyone was in the bar .
we had been served by a girl with an illini scarf and was awesome .
then ... .another girl took over .
we ordered a diet with vodka , a coors light and _num_ joes brew .
what we received was a coke and jack and _num_ coors light .
amateur at best .
service was horrible from the start .
we waited for an eternity just to get menus .
second biggest problem is that nothing comes out at the same time .
only _num_ waters came out , before the best _num_ .
all of our burgers came out at different times .
also , between each visit from our waitress , there is a long wait .
now the food .
i got the california burger with onions rings .
i 'd be shocked if they even seasoned their burger patty .
only thing worth anything was their perfect onion rings .
at full price , i 'd rather go to burger king or tgif .
it 's also unfortunate that their _num_ bud light draft special was broken .
i thought they 'd replace the deal with something else other than can bud-a-ritas ...
if you really want to try this place come for half off burgers .
on a thursday .
i 'm thoroughly disappointed .
they 've got some really great specials !
we came on a friday and got a pitcher of shandy for $ _num_ .
also , i really liked the fries ! !
customer service is pretty lax , but not necessarily poor .
restrooms are clean ... enough .
overall , a great experience !
always packed and the dance floor is small and dirty .
i guess i used to like clys better but they went downhill too .
classic college bar .
drinks are reasonably priced .
service is decent .
this place is cavernous !
you can walk around in there and keep finding little niches to stand .
ample tvs for game watching and great college spirit .
my niece enjoyed her `` gatorade '' which looked pretty good .
despite the frigid temps , the entire place was rockin ' !
solid drinking establishment !
this is one of my favorite bars on campus .
but only go there late if your planning on getting wild .
the drinks are mediocre .
food was pretty good , loved the mac and cheese as an upgrade .
however today 's visit had a special friend attend with us .
spotted a cockroach crawling on the wall .
so much for the green health inspection sign on the door !
needless to say we wo n't be back anytime soon .
oh my god .
where can i start with this place ?
it is the greatest creation ever .
this bar alone has changed humanity .
i had the craziest adventure of my life at this establishment .
my first experience with joe 's was late on a weekend .
farren 's was my favorite burger until i tried the ragin ' cajun .
even the fries were on point and i typically hate fries .
i was n't even drunk and this meal was like a religious experience .
this is a great spot for lunch or early dinner .
one of the worst bars on campus .
the place gets super crowded and the music is deafening .
i 've been here a few times and tried their burgers .
they 're alright .
i 'm guessing the grill just had n't been cleaned in a while ...
if you want a good burger , go to seven saints or destihl .
this place feels just like your local frat house .
reviewing joe 's solely based on their food , which is surprisingly delicious .
i 've had most of the burgers without mushrooms .
like there are much worse things going on at this campus than this .
joe 's is soft .
high key soft for allowing this .
if your not _num_ do n't even bother showing up .
finally got to stop in for lunch !
who knew this place had such great lunch !
dance floor is all right , music selection could be much better .
it 's easy to get bored .
fantastic scenery !
the service is incredible !
all yah need is a beer and a mother egging bro
i also got a great brow wax .
nice staff and reasonable prices , what more could a girl ask for ?
?
however , i 've still somehow gotten some awful haircuts in my tenure .
it 's always perfect , and she communicates really well .
erin was very nice , and we chatted the whole time .
that sucks .
so , i went and was told i 'd be seeing debbie .
i did n't know what to expect , but she was great .
she 's also really personable and knows all her customers by name .
i liked my experience there so much that i 've gone back several times .
i also have referred a few friends who also love debbie .
the hair salon next door , lando is a rip off .
overall , hb is great , even for guys .
they totally listen to your needs and you end up walking out feeling good .
the prices are reasonable for the area and service is great .
getting a haircut and styled runs about $ _num_ for me .
for a guys haircut , it is the perfect price for what i get .
it is quick too and i never wait long .
the stylists are nice and friendly .
tracey did my wax and i will definitely be going there again .
she is a nice lady who knew what she was doing .
tracy is great !
the stylist , aly , was incredibly nice and friendly .
she listened to what i wanted and then preformed an excellent haircut .
however , i will not go anywhere else on campus for my hair .
good cheap hair cut for men .
i was happy to find out that donna trained at aveda and came here .
for good cheap modern haircuts you ca n't go wrong here .
great , helpful staff always makes you feel welcome .
never a bad experience .
tracy rocks !
and vanilla .
very friendly service and everything is homemade on the premises .
mmmmmmm
i love the cookie jar .
the regular cookies are also really good .
they always seem to be ever so slightly underdone , which i love .
the prices are reasonable and the staff is very friendly .
very friendly staff , and delicious cookies .
are they fancy and unique flavors likely to be featured in gourmet magazines ?
no .
are they straight-up delicious ?
absolutely !
omg !
their cookies are delicious !
i had the peanut butter cookie ( awesome !
) , rice krispy treat ( delicious !
hands downs , best cookie is the buttercreme sandwich .
this place has the best cookies and customer service !
their staff is so nice and accommodating .
their cookies , all varieties , are absolutely amazing .
my favorite is the sugar cookie with icing .
the price is right and so is the location .
cookies were ok but not mind blowing good .
i tried the double chocolate chip , chocolate chip walnut and chocolate chunk .
the chocolate chunk was by far the best of the three .
there was a lot of choco chunks and they were still a little gooey .
yum !
i was n't that big of a fan of the chocolate chip walnut .
the double choco cookie was fine .
a bit flat , in flavor and literally .
went with a co-worker and i am not a sweet things fan .
but their cookie is creamy and sweet .
the good :
- the cookies are just delicious .
- the prices are reasonable .
- the service here is great .
the meh :
more obvious signage may be beneficial .
overall :
i would definitely come back .
best cookie place in town ! ! !
ed is the nicest owner there is .
his cookie cakes are amazing .
and do n't even try the double doozies because you will be addicted .
great local place with great treats at great prices ! ! !
thank you cookie jar !
!
great little cookie shop !
prices are very reasonable !
lots to choose from too !
cookies are awesome !
i love the peanut butter !
my husband loved the buttercream sandwiches .
soft , chewy and delicious cookies , you ca n't go wrong !
i lived here my freshman year , and it definitely was n't my favorite .
the rooms are big , so at first bromley felt like a good deal .
as an engineer , i had 8:00 calculus most mornings .
if your goal is to party constantly , this is your dorm .
i lived at bromley hall my freshman and sophomore years .
made some great friends , many of which i still hangout with ...
much better than she describes .
funny she also mentions the elevators .
lol !
those are some good stories : - )
maid service .
it can be good , it can be bad .
never attempt to order food for delivery from here .
it will take well over an hour and be ice cold and mushy .
there is much better drunk food .
there is much better sober food .
chipotle is better than this qdoba
for fast food burritoes , i definitely choose qdoba over chipotle .
eww chipotle .
gross chipotle .
i wo n't even go for the free burrito day at chipotle .
but anyway , back to qdoba .
meh .
do yourself a favor and get something better .
qdoba is a pretty decent fast-food mexican place .
but the killing blow came when they got rid of the mol burrito .
they replaced it with a rather disgusting bbq burrito that pales in comparison .
worse yet they keep very inconsistent hours when students are away .
horrible food , only slightly more mexican than taco bell .
also pretty much identical to chipotle , which might be slightly better .
not worth the price .
also the lines at lunchtime can be ridiculous , which is sad .
it 's more expensive than taco bell and similar price to chipotle .
at least use a mixed cheese blend !
oh well .
on top of that , their hours are all over the place .
chipotle is open more frequently .
it 's worth waiting in line at chipotle .
never any lines to worry about here !
horrible .
not a smile to be found .
and my lettuce was rotten , wilted and brown .
who 's in charge here ?
makes me wonder whether the meat is beyond its expiration date too .
an empty restaurant like qdoba speaks for itself .
my order was simple - all i wanted was burrito , without the meat .
i can only imagine what might happen if i did ...
i had a 10:00 a.m. appt .
and got there on time .
i waited _num_ minutes and no one ever showed up to open the shop .
no phone call either .
i 've heard this same story from others .
wo n't be trying this place again .
evidently his time is much more important than mine .
i have brought both of my golden retrievers to this small grooming business .
no one does a better job on goldens , or loves dogs more !
now there is even no cigarette smoke .
we will continue to use them .
they did a great job both grooming/washing my dog and trimming her nails .
both employees love dogs and are very friendly !
_num_ stars really is more accurate ...
the variety is amazing-the prices ... .they tend to be a little high .
he has a great sensibility and i love the window displays !
i also love the location .
sometimes , they 're just not open when they 're supposed to be .
just went into this shop for the first time yesterday .
great selection of items and the owner seemed like a genuinely really nice guy .
i ended up buying an item and he was even willing to barter .
i will definitely buy from him again .
highly recommended .
i really love this place .
sarah at hancock fabrics has been wonderful !
i really enjoy shopping there when she works there .
i also had my sewing machine fixed up there .
they outsource the repair to another company out in bloomington .
overall , the service is much there than at joanne !
if you can , check out hancock fabrics !
i gave this place _num_ chances before firing them as my dentist .
i regret chosing champaign dental group .
scam artists , plain and simple .
i have never heard of this .
this place is just alright .
she has a technique where the shots do not hurt too bad .
i usually have a problem with them billing my insurance as well .
like many other reviewers , i have suffered some bad experiences at champaign dental .
my dental insurance did n't cover such expenses .
why ?
on a better note , the hygienist , mandi , is wonderful .
i will avoid them all as well .
do n't trust this place .
i really enjoy the dental hygienist i see .
her technique is great , and my visits are quick and painless .
dr. kuo is great as well .
i am glad i checked with another dentist first !
do not go to champaign dental ! !
!
best dental experience of my life !
i hate going to the dentist , despise it even .
because of this latter fact , i have told all my coworkers about it !
definitely recommend !
nice staff and very helpful with getting me in fast and inexpensive .
this place is a scam .
it 's terrible .
convinced me i needed a cap , i did n't .
convinced me i had a new cavity every six months .
i changed dentists and have n't had a cavity in three years .
she had her room decorated and very homey looking .
i loved this place ! !
!
charlotte and dr. colin were great .
then , dr. colin came in .
escobar . ''
i was flabbergasted .
it would greatly behoove dr. colin to learn an iota of compassion and understanding .
shame on you , dr. colin !
they also had n't sorted out things with my insurance company .
as stated in other reviews these people are scam artists .
my first visit i went for normal x-ray and cleaning covered by insurance .
the hygienist spent her time and did an outstanding job .
she proceeds to tell me that today 's visit is $ _num_ .
i told her that i my insurance was to covere this visit _num_ % .
_num_ weeks later i 'm back to get the filling replaced .
got the filling then went to check out with `` d '' .
she of course proceeds to charge me as if that phone called never happened .
she came back a minute later and said ok now i remember you .
i do n't even know where to begin .
i came in thinking i had a cavity or two .
i left with the great news of `` you have _num_ cavities ! ''
keep in mind i have n't had a cavity since my baby teeth ...
probably at least _num_ years ago .
so i said yes .
: ( do not go here ! ! ! ! ! !
!
i will keep this short and sweet .
got a second opinion at a reputable , family dentist office .
no braces needed .
no cavities .
stay away from these money hungry thieves !
funny because our insurance covers visits , and fillings !
going to have records transferred elsewhere .
stay away from these money hungry thieves !
funny because our insurance covers visits , and fillings !
going to have records transferred elsewhere .
do n't go here .
she made this clear _num_ times .
a desperate excuse ) .
again only replying because they care about her teeth , lol !
anyway she got manipulated into the fluoride treatment .
horrible customer service and do not care about their patients .
all they care about is money and not the patient 's needs .
: )
grateful patients ,
the thomas family
i wish i can give zero star !
i should have read the reviews here before i went there for _num_ times .
i want to do once .
then they did the cleaning .
i said i am here for the free cleaning !
then they send bills later of the service date .
never ever go to this one !
it 's crispy and chewy and filled with yummy cheese .
it felt very cozy and welcoming , which is a great feature .
the food was very good !
i ordered a vegetarian stir-fried noodle dish and was totally happy with my selection .
they taste just like the ones at panda express .
over-all it was a pleasure to eat here and i will definetly go back !
my favorite chinese place to get lunch in champaign !
: )
i also really appreciate their service .
great place !
let me save you the trouble of coming here .
rainbow garden is basically all talk and no walk .
go to peking garden instead .
these guys at rainbow garden need to lighten up !
!
i ate it because i was hungry .
i got the spicy eggplant in black bean sauce and mixed vegetables with noodles .
there was hardly any flavor .
like really gross .
the other dish had no flavor really .
the crab rangoon were good though a little too cream cheesy .
i dont know .
it was reasonably priced .
like i said , i was hungry .
hungry enough for it again when i am in champaign ?
probably not .
do n't believe some of the whiney reviewers on this site ...
it 's a chinese restaurant for god 's sake !
you were expecting gourmet dining ?
best chinese food in cu .
inexpensive/plentiful lunch options and relatively quick delivery time make this an excellent choice .
i typically stick the chicken dishes , but the mooshu ( sp ? )
plates are amazing .
the kitchen had lost our order .
to apologize , the manager brought out a free appetizer and entree .
on top of that he waived the entire cost of the meal .
rg really cares about its customers .
rainbow garden is great for dining in or taking out .
the service is excellent and the food is always fantastic .
nice place have been back multiple times .
unpretentious on the outside , nice on the inside .
i 've ordered delivery from this place in the past .
however , i enjoyed my first dining experience couple days ago .
i am surprised to enter a clean and quiet place .
rainbow garden had a nice oriental ambiance .
you do n't see many places like that at asian restaurants .
enough with the wall color and such ... .
the lunch special was a very reasonable price ranging between $ 5- $ _num_ .
my boyfriend and i have grown to have bigger appetite over the month .
: )
do n't get me wrong , their delivery service is fast and good also .
this food is legit .
i have always ordered delivery from here .
i usually never have anything to complain about because rainbow garden is great .
but , their owners/managers are always so angry for some reason .
this is not the way to handle customer service , people !
braised chicken/shrimp/whateverelse protein is always good .
try anything .
the service is rude here .
they are impersonal and impolite .
the food is ok , nothing outstanding but not horrible .
in short : food is decent but service is horrible .
i ordered a jajangmyeon and tangsuyuk for takeout .
prices were comparable to what i would pay back home near chicago .
the portions were pretty decent as well .
taste-wise the jajangmyeon was good , but not as good as back home .
the tangsuyuk was nicely fried and cripsy .
i went here on a tuesday afternoon at about 5pm .
it went smooth enough though , and my order came fast , within minutes .
i probably could have done better at home .
was packed like sardines tonight .
it 's fairly reasonably priced , the decor is nice ( i.e .
the food was good , i suppose .
i liked it enough .
i 'd come back .
i wish they gave me some more rice though .
i like a lot of rice .
i have been going to this place for years .
i swear they have gotten even better recently .
i got chicken eggplant last time i went and it was amazing .
food took no time to get to us .
ca n't wait to go back !
i recently got this for delivery which was very quick .
i have had other things from here previously that i also really enjoyed .
the prices are reasonable and the delivery charge is understandable .
also the fact that they have online ordering now is a big plus .
i will definitely be ordering from them again .
we soooo over ordered .
we started with sechuan wontons which were tasty and inexpensive .
he also had beef lo mein that was pretty tasty .
we have at least two meals each to take home with us .
so good !
we order from here on a regular basis .
we always order the general 's chicken and barbecued pork fried rice .
delivery is always very quick .
i also appreciated that they only used white meat chicken .
the restaurant is actually much bigger than you would perceive from the outside .
rainbow garden is solid and authentic .
you can tell that they care about presentation with regards to their dishes .
their menu is pretty unique and the house specials are delicious .
i have been ordering food from rainbow garden for ten years .
their food is delicious , it 's always hot , and delivery is fast !
rainbow garden is also a great spot for lunch .
but the food quality here is very good and everything tastes fresh .
i 'm a fan .
the general 's chicken seemed to have poorer quality chicken then usual .
perhaps this was just an off night .
so disappointed .
surprisingly good - my advice ?
go there .
it 's a much more enjoyable experience than typical mid-west delivery 'chinese ' food .
the food was okay but some of the staff are very rude and uncourteous .
look at your receipt !
the food quality is ok. kinda pricey though .
the price is never a problem for me to be honest .
the biggest problem is their service .
the staff there are rude and impolite .
and complained about trivial things .
i will never go to this place anymore .
we went for a quick lunch .
pros : good portion size .
hot and sour soup and crab rangoons were pretty good .
cons : we did n't enjoy the garlic chicken too much .
we actually brought it home thinking that we would possibly eat it later .
we ended up tossing it .
did n't compare at all to what we can get a home .
take home : i 'll be trying out a new chinese place next time .
this place however always hits the spot for me .
though i think the atmosphere is very cozy and welcoming .
everything here is very clean as well .
quick service that is very friendly .
a large menu , and all is very well made and prepared .
fresh and tasty food .
lots of lunch and dinner specials as well .
i always love the dumplings ( how can anybody not love them ) .
the different types of pork , chicken , and beef are all excellent .
from sweet n sour to bbq or stir fry .
a small beer and wine menu .
though the gekkeikan plum wine is amazing .
if all were of this quality , i would go for chinese more often .
i like the place for the atmosphere and of course the food .
i always order sizzler beef which it 's good .
good environment .
a more classy chinese food place .
more expensive but better service .
has authentic stuff and americanized stuff like orange chicken too..
extremely fast delivery !
great crab rangoons .
that was extremely rude and i was quite offended by it .
we love rainbow garden !
the food is a bit high-priced but it is worth it .
the food is n't greasy at all and the flavor is excellent .
worth a try if you have n't already .
what a pleasant surprise in urbana champaign !
i ordered the jajang myun , which is the black bean noodles .
it came with a loads of seafood , beef , and vegetables .
we also got the sweet fried beef , which was also very tasty .
i was very pleased with those dishes , especially my black bean noodles .
the portions are generous and the food is tasty .
a very cozy chinese place with a warm and comfortable atmosphere .
i had the spicy chicken with basil , which was very good .
i was a bit apprehensive about getting _num_ per order .
many mentioned the portions were large here .
i 'm giving this place _num_ stars .
the only down side is that i do n't get to champaign often enough .
but if i do , i will stop by again for sure .
went with white coworkers for lunch a few times .
food was greasy as hell .
how do you mess up a fried rice ?
i ate it with my chopsticks .
i got the garlic battered shrimp with cashews which was good - 3.5/5 .
my boyfriend got the tofu stir fry with mushrooms and it was disappointing .
i would say a 2/5 .
i would be back for the walnut shrimp or the garlic shrimp .
the tofu stir fry was $ _num_ .
large portions , and a very tentative staff .
food was good , and we will come back soon .
i placed my order for carry out .
the woman taking my order over the phone was very friendly .
she reviewed my order and let me know total amount on phone .
she gave me a _num_ minute wait time .
it was ready when i got there .
the food was so delicious ! !
everyone was happy with all .
our favorite dish was the crab rangoon appetizer .
we will definitely use this rainbow garden next time we want chinese food .
the food is also pretty good and the portions are on the larger side .
superb .
great staff , great food , and large servings .
order delivery through eatstreet.com .
the delivery speed is pretty fast , around _num_ minutes .
she 's pretty happy with both the quality and the quantity of the food .
the wonton , according to her , was specially delicious .
when this place opened it was more under-the-radar .
it became a bit generic .
but thats just my opinion .
* for good drinks
* for good shows
* * for awesome outdoor seating
cowboy monkey is a fairly nice bar in downtown champaign .
in the winter it kind of sucks because the indoor seating is fairly limited .
lots of seating and great atmosphere .
and thats only in the summer .
the kitchen is closed in the winter months .
mediocre draft beer list ( especially for champaign ) , but decent martinis .
yum !
i stopped going here last week because
* the beer tastes watered-down and the food is ridiculously bland and over-priced .
i used to think it was a one-star .
yeay .
ick .
cowboy monkey tries a bit too hard .
and on friday nights is absolutely infested with frat bros. wtf .
that said , the drinks are strong , and the desserts are good .
how can you not serve food after midnight ?
geez , alcohol makes me so hungry ! !
just really fucking atrocious and embarrassing .
you lose , buddy .
$ _num_ pbr bottles all night long .
attentive and nice barkeeps .
mix of 40somethings and college kids .
decent sound .
class organization all around .
unless i find something more lively , this will have to do for now .
also , let me point out that the dj kind of sucks .
anyways , have fun in your own way .
i will .
this is a review for their sunday night trivia .
the beer specials are pretty good , i have to give them that .
pretty generous .
trivia is a cross between the way boltini 's and canopy does it .
_num_ max per team ; you pick your team name .
there are breaks for bathroom etc .
so why two stars ?
the format needs significant tweaking .
the first question of each round is worth _num_ and the last _num_ points .
why should some worthless knowledge be more highly prized ?
this problem is compounded as points rack up for the final calculation .
also , the strict adherence to narrow categories does n't work .
lastly , i ordered the gazpacho .
it was bad .
it was really just pico de gallo with more cucumbers .
not a soup but more of a raw salsa with large chunks .
the food here is excellent .
they open just in time for ebertfest at the end of april .
i hated this place .
i arrived and found a seat outside , so as to smoke .
i 'm still out $ _num_ to them , three days later .
i paid $ _num_ for two bottles of pbr at this point .
so , i 'm not too pleased with the place .
they 've also started sunday night trivia which has become a big hit .
definitely worth checking out !
we left after the bar tender insulted my friend .
to top off our bad experience , this place steals your money .
later my cleared bank statement says the jerk gave himself a $ _num_ tip !
that is not ok !
meh .
i 'm not .
it 's crowded .
the service sucks .
the drinks are watery .
the food is just ... . well , shitty bar food .
and it 's loud .
and did i mention crowded ?
that ship has sailed .
it 's not though .
it used to be .
now i avoid it like that plague .
great patio .
odd bathroom set up .
a nice little cocktail menu for a slightly more upscale dancy bar .
would go again ... mostly for convenience .
: )
you must try the braised pork crisp !
awesome beer selection !
the questions were perfect for our group of _num_ .
i even got to answer some ; )
can not think of a better way to spend a sunday .
love the salsa dancing here !
sat out side and had a cilantro , lime & chicken crisper .
overall had a pretty good taste .
cowboy monkey is a solidly mediocre bar .
what the hell ?
the liquor and beer selection is about average for champaign .
some weird management decisions at this place .
as long as i 'm griping , i want to mention the bathrooms .
fix your locks , cheapskates .
great during the spring/summer/early fall because of outdoor seating !
also during this time the food is great !
trivia is fun on sunday 's with dave .
great food & patio
cowboy ...
thank you for being free entry .
this places rules !
great food ,
great drinks ,
great sound engineer , ( he even gave me a wireless mic ! )
thanks derek !
great staff
rad stage ,
fun bartenders ,
vegan options ,
all you can eat chips and salsa ,
outdoor seating ,
it 's perfect rock n roll club !
but we went here for a friend 's birthday and i was thoroughly impressed .
the staff was welcoming , kind and understood exactly what we wanted .
sitting outside was relaxing and lovely .
peaceful decor and just all around great night !
ca n't wait to return !
they have a huge drink menu .
my margarita tasted like orange juice ... no hint of a margarita : ( .
the nachos were just average mostly goopy .
horrible experience !
not an honest business .
will not be returning .
definitely an amazing patio situation happening .
the service also was quite friendly , attentive and spot on .
the weak bit is their food .
as a pre-dinner ( or even post dinner ) establishment - solid .
as the dinner establishment - not so much .
if based on patio and beverages alone ... well , would definitely rank higher .
food is always consistent and tastes well .
beware things can be a bit spicy .
the waitresses on the other hand are not good .
patio atmosphere is nice but music tends to be a bit too loud .
outdoor seating is awesome ! !
great location .
food is yummy .
can be spicy .
my friends love the bean dip .
servers can be on the slow side .
however , emily is an excellent server .
i went to cowboy monkey on sunday for trivia night .
the rounds are weighted from very easy to impossible .
some of the general knowledge trivia is so random .
there is no way you can really study for trivia .
the special on sundays is $ _num_ nachos .
i also had the quesadilla , which was a tri-cheese quesadilla .
it tasted like a quesadilla you could make at home , nothing special .
i went to cowboy monkey with some friends for their sunday night trivia .
we left and went somewhere that appreciates our business .
come here for drinks , do not stay for the food .
first time there ... .
very small place .
bartender was super rude .
not kidding .
nice atmosphere with the patio seating .
we are n't from the area and wanted to try a local beer .
waitress could not tell us anything about the beers on tap .
menu listed regular beers on tap that were n't .
she said she was n't a beer drinker .
then told us every beer was an ipa .
after googling the names , i figured out she was n't correct .
we hung in there and i ordered a beer .
hubby gave up and ordered scotch .
then the chips and `` salsa '' arrived .
it was n't salsa ...
it was watery pico de gallo .
korean owned asian supermarket ... they have fruit from california for a reasonable price .
reminds me of home .
this is how an asian super-market should be .
am-ko is the best !
they have produce though , too , and it 's very affordable .
first of all , am-ko is huge for an ethnic shop in the midwest .
there is also a moderately-sized selection of kitchen and grooming/beauty supplies .
the better of the two asian grocery stores on/around campus .
) , and lots of random drinks , candies , snacks , etc .
like a traditional store in asia .
this normally would have been _num_ stars , but i am a bit worried .
i remember going to am-ko as a kid .
we used to go when they had their home nearby on green st .
but
it appears the ownership has very recently changed ? ? ?
i noticed a lot of produce was gone , and shelves were semi-bare .
no one appears to be the same staff as little as a month ago .
does anyone know what happened to the great owners ?
am-ko definitely has a lot of asian goods .
this is definitely the place to go if you need anything asian in champaign !
the whole place is cleaner and brighter than the other oriental stores around town .
prices are fair .
they have some great harder-to-find packaged items ( melon bars - yes , please !
) , but they sold us a whole bagful of rotten purple yams ! !
what ? !
we got home and started preparing them before we figured it out .
gross .
produce is limited , but dry goods are extensive .
what i ca n't find here i get at the green onion .
big selection , low prices .
awesome green-tea icecream .
like this place !
it feels like real market .
some of the prices are absolute bargain/basement .
great place to pick up some loose green tea and all of the accoutrements .
this small market was a huge surprise to me .
i deduct a star because of the lack of anything fresh .
fresh vegetable section is very limited .
fresh anything is very limited .
i bought daikon radish here .
well , i am pretty sure that is what i bought .
they were out of it at far east .
i read it burns fat .
we shall see : i already need to go get more .
they keep the coffee candy right next to the register .
i love the ginseng root in a cute little bottle .
tastes like dirt .
i would like to repurpose the little bottles and fit them with corks .
paul and i also walked out with a 20lb bag of rice .
we were told it will be sticky rice .
we are accustomed to long grain .
i like all the bulk grains and the flours .
this store is cramped in a lot of good ways .
there is some serious inventory in here .
worth checking out for sure if you have n't .
you need chinese rice vinegar ?
check .
japanese dashi ?
check .
korean gochujang ?
check .
i was able to find the green tea that i was craving here .
honestly ... do n't go here .
i can understand having a bad day , but that woman is just terrible .
the store itself is not the worst but it seems a little dirty .
they have a good selection so i ca n't complain about that .
in my opinion , make the trip to green onion instead .
it 's cleaner and they 're much nicer .
has some good drinks and snacks .
imagine will be pretty cool for koreans to buy some delicate and hometown food .
literally the best place for students and locals who want diversity in their food .
they also sell henna here !
there is a halal meat section in the back corner freezer .
do your research and know what you 're trying to buy !
to get there , simply take the _num_ teal .
it 's just down the street from the stop at first and white .
i 'm so glad that this place exists !
the lady working this place is very ignorant and rude !
they 're so overprice and the produce is not good !
there 's nothing good in here .
go to other asian stores cause this one will waste your time .
a note to the management of the hawthorn suites :
_num_ a half wall and a love seat do not a `` suite '' make
_num_ let 's step into the 21st century : some wireless please
_num_ women like conditioner and lotion .
why are hotels still using this `` conditioning '' shampoo crap ?
most half decent hotels have upgraded to down comforters .
they are warmer , more washable , and generally less gross .
_num_ .
please do n't send housekeeping around knocking on doors at _num_ and 8:30 .
first of all 2x is unnecessary .
second of all , some people are jet lagged .
thank you .
_num_ a curved shower curtain bar does not make it a bigger shower .
thank you , hawthorn suites , for the following :
_num_ awesome breakfast ( omelet bar ? ! )
_num_ plug in for my ipod in the clock radio
_num_ being so kind as to hold my fedex boxes for me .
for my money the hampton inn is a better hotel .
with some upgrades , this one could be a winner .
not bad .
it was pretty cheap .
the rooms were updated and clean - comfy bed , down comforter .
parking kind of sucked .
there is a lot behind the hotel and across the street .
not a big deal , but i 'm lazy .
there 's a lovely tgi fridays right next door , so that was convenient .
not a bad time down in champagna .
it 's an indoor version of your average best western motel .
so it constantly sounded like there was crazy wind outside .
i had a decent experience overall .
i 'll start with the good stuff .
now for the not so good .
the bathroom is incredibly tiny .
and what the hell is up with the water pressure ?
oh , and one other thing .
wrong again .
seriously .
ugh .
i went with this place for location .
hawthorn suites is a total has-been on the champaign hotel scene .
yes , interviews in a hotel room !
the interior is still tired looking .
the toiletries were surprisingly bath and body works .
this place was ok for champagne-urbana .
stayed here for my cousins wedding .
now , i think it 's probably the best hotel in champaign .
everyone there is super friendly and i think it 's gotten a lot nicer !
the rooms are dated , and the layout pushes the definition of suite .
the bathroom was tiny and the dressing/grooming mirror was out in the main room .
there seemed to be a lot of exterior noise as well .
with two double beds , and a couch .
slept _num_ comfortably .
sure enough , it rotates .
i could n't hear any noise from other rooms or the hallway .
free wi-fi that was pretty fast , and no password was required .
lobby was clean and attractive .
just a little over a mile , i think .
very doable if you 're in decent shoes !
i was worried when i read some of the old reviews .
think new carpet , wall paper , drapes and furniture .
bad news is they still do n't do very well with hot water .
the bathroom is still small and there is limited counter top space .
but a wonderful new thing to brag about .
i have never noticed this in any other hotel .
our group had our own breakout room so we could take our food there .
but , as others have said , space is limited .
seating is very limited given the size of the hotel .
there was a lot of staff at breakfast and they kept everything well stocked .
and they were very friendly .
i definitely would choose to stay here .
finally , the wifi is slow but constant .
i never got dropped .
i could always sign on .
but slow .
make sure to have the free amazing breakfast !
there is an omelet chef making you the omelet your way !
free !
this was a first pick via the flying service here at local airport .
was convenient to find , about _num_ miles from the airport .
great location just north side of downtown area .
i would stay again , likely .
otherwise , good winter-time bedding , heating system , etc .
thanks folks .
well done .
found super gross spots on the sheet under the pillows .
the most gross place i 've ever stayed .
do they even clean the room ?
!
there 's a thief working here !
or either a very careless housekeeping staff ... or both .
when we checked out , we inadvertently left some clothes in the drawers .
some of these were new & never before worn .
when i packed up to leave i forgot the things in the drawer !
i called the hotel .
breakfast is great !
however you will be trapped here .
the van will not take you anywhere .
it goes to and from the airport .
arrived at 6:30 pm .
checkin at 3pm normally .
rooms not ready , manager rude and did not offer any sort of concession .
disappointing service .
stayed here multiple times .
close proximity to memorial stadium .
dog friendly .
within walking distance to many restaurants .
staff is friendly & polite .
complimentary breakfast is 2nd to none .
three thumbs up !
granted it was homecoming weekend but this place was pretty filthy .
the common areas were really filthy .
the core infrastructure is not good .
loud !
room layout dumb .
rented a `` suite '' .
bathroom was _num_ x _num_ tops .
vanity , sink outside of bathroom .
if someone wants to get up and get ready , everyone is waking up .
large room space just laid out terribly .
door is in the middle of the entry wall so very inefficient layout .
the free breakfast was the only saving grace .
it was tremendous !
oh !
me first , me first !
finish line , you stink .
seriously .
i was in the market for a new pair of running shoes .
i happened to be in the mall .
to which ... i said , `` no .
never . ''
i went in , knowing exactly what i wanted .
anyone ... .
just come on by ... .
anytime now .
he did n't .
it was like i was invisible , y'all .
i walked over .
put the shoe back on the shelf , and walked the eff out .
the end .
worst shopping experience ever .
all their sales associate were walking around without doing anything useful for the customers .
i was waiting someone to help me with some pick-up stuff .
i 'd been waiting there forever .
the associates saw me waiting but just walking towards the other way .
they just pretended they did n't see you .
seems like i am not the only one .
the store just sucks .
love love love this place .
favorites are the honey whole wheat , the cheddar garlic , and anything apple .
and the scones .
i love the scones .
but they sure are yummy .
also love the make-your-own sandwich option .
yum .
this is the best ever ! ! !
i hope you can visit soon and often you wo n't be disappointed .
it is truly one of a kind place .
another artsy-fartsy purveyor of `` artisan '' products .
these loaves are neither .
their much hyped cinnamon rolls disappointed .
the outer layers were dry .
how dry ?
okay , that 's an exaggeration , but the outer layers were very dry .
and for making real bread .
when i was little , i loved when we got bread from great harvest .
but really , no matter when you go , you wo n't be disappointed .
their breads are all heavy and thick .
the honey whole wheat is perfect toasted , and their apple breads are amazing .
you can also call ahead orders so you wo n't miss out .
how can i not love a place that supports local running ? !
even with that bit of business , i stinkin ' love this place .
it 's great stuff .
i had always assumed they were a local business .
bread here is sinful .
i would love to see some sprouted and gluten-free options .
amazing !
it 's a bakery that makes some sandwiches .
they have homemade jams and nut butters , fresh bread daily .
the offer samples of their bread while you take a look around .
i got their turkey sandwich , which was nothing special but still good .
it 's wonderful and fresh .
i will be going back there often to buy my bread from now on .
the staff was friendly and really helpful too .
the bread , cookies , bars , dessert loaves , etc .
the occasional specialty breads are to die for .
they now offer sandwiches to go , but i have n't yet tried one .
their whole wheat breads are especially superior -- chewy and richly flavored .
their white breads and challah are good , too .
i 've even tried their carb control bread .
great harvest bread company is one of our local treasures .
i ca n't recommend this bakery enough !
the flavor of the ham was really good and everything was fresh and crisp .
the bread was a little stiff but that did n't bother me .
they offer you slices of bread to try .
i chose some cinnamon bread that was very good .
they have jelly 's , spread , breads , sandwiches , salads and soups .
like their freshly baked goods .
bought a almond vanilla swirl .
not cheap but taste good .
food is great !
bread is awesome !
staff is friendly !
keep up the great work .
nice lounge with real people .
good hamburgers and cheddar broccoli .
also a great black bean burger .
excellent place to grab lunch .
reminds me of southport avenue in chicago .
it was a saturday night , when the bar is super crowded .
anyway , you order your food to the bartenders .
i do n't like the idea .
to be honest , i dod n't like either of them .
the greek one was a disaster .
it was supposed to have sausage , but i could n't taste any .
the vegetarian one , although being the better one , was kind of juicy .
a juicy pizza is not my favorite .
i 'm not against non-american-style thin crust pizzas .
as a matter of fact , i love jupiter 's pizzas .
but these ones , well , you heard me .
really ?
what the hell , it 's a great dive bar .
i cant ' even hate on it .
decent beer selection .
peanuts in the shell , eat them and throw the shells on the floor .
_num_ pool tables .
relaxed and laid back .
just your basic , no frills , hang out with your buddies , bar .
she had been to esquire before and said the burgers were good .
i really like the place .
i had the chicken tender sandwich with fries , and it was fabulous .
everything a fried chicken finger sandwich could be .
i enjoyed sitting outside and watching the people walk by .
and she loved that they had fat tire on tap .
overall , i would definitely recommend this place .
there 's decent pub food .
when the weather is good , there 's outdoor patio seating .
esquire rocks .
the place is dirt cheap and the food is simple and good .
also , they have a number of large pool tables .
i had the greatest experience at esquire .
our food was delicious , came hot , and was inexpensive .
it was a wonderful experience .
i love this place so much ...
it 's my favorite bar in town .
it 's a great bar with a great drink selection .
but it went to terrible after yesterday .
i went with two friends to have some drinks and pizza .
she basically wanted to know why we would want such a thing .
she ignored us and stalked off , returning with our money shortly thereafter .
the dude listened to us and in short said , `` too bad !
she is the owner 's daughter ! ''
wow , what an experience .
i will never go there again !
terrible service !
so so food !
not worth it one bit !
my fianc and i go here all of the time and love it .
it is a great bar for relaxing and enjoying some cheap drinks .
the food is typical bar food , but is also priced right .
esquire pretty much kicks ass .
i mean hardcore !
esquire is awesome !
the staff is extremely friendly and attentive .
the food is cheap and is great , drunk or sober .
i recommend the asian dumplings , or a burger .
their contusions are amazing ( pineapple infused tequila ) ! !
but i guess that just goes to show the people that frequent esquire .
in general , the crowd is older , and everyone seem to be regulars .
lots of outdoor seating too .
this place is right across the street from the station .
the bartenders called the guy a cab and made sure he got home okay .
the beer selection was surprisingly good .
the food was pretty good as well .
i had a simple cheeseburger and fries .
the cheap food and beer is an added bonus .
and i almost forgot , free peanuts !
) , got cheap drinks , and just had a relaxing low-key night .
love love love this place .
welp , we found all of that , and some , at esquire .
oh , and did i mention they have free peanuts ?
or that you simply spit the peanut shells out on the floor ?
yeah , it 's that type of place ... .i love it .
all of it .
and i also love their special pineapple-induced tequila .
to die for .
awesome awesome awesome .
once i do , i 'll be back to recap on that ... .
holy hell .
what have i been doing with my life ?
i am regretting all the times i went to campus bars .
plus , the deals !
_num_ asian dumplings for around 5-6 dollars ?
delicious black bean burger for about _num_ bucks ?
gin and tonic ( my standard drink ) for less than _num_ bucks ?
what is not to love ?
plus free peanuts !
i love free peanuts .
but so far , all systems go .
the burgers are some of the best in champaign .
the pizza is good and comes in a number of varieties .
the one complaint i have is that the service can be especially hit-and-miss .
overall , esquire is a down-to-earth place with good prices and good food .
i 'm liking this spot !
most reasonable damn drink prices in town .
music low enough to hold conversation if so inclined .
not a shit-ton of kids ( undergrads ) around to annoy .
good spot to get your grown-folks drink on .
did i mention the most reasonable drink prices around ?
three pints of pbr under _num_ bucks for the win !
will come again .
not so bad , and definitely not traditional bar food .
that said , we opt for better food in the downtown area .
the portobello mushroom sandwich is delicious .
food here is just fine , and very reasonably priced .
the gross looking jar on the bar is infused vodka .
service is always friendly , and fastest at the bar .
you can order lunch ahead and pick up _num_ minutes later .
of course , that 's just fine with me .
this is the first bar i visited when i moved here five years ago .
it 's a good place , even taking none of the above into account .
the people who frequent this place are an interesting mix .
some townies , some students , some regulars , some noobs .
my number _num_ `` go-to '' place .
great food , great drinks , and a great place to just hang out .
the `` cheers '' of champaign !
lots of friendly regulars hanging out at the bar !
i only went there once but i really liked it .
i have never been to a place where it felt so comfortable .
i got a burger which was pretty good and reasonably priced .
they have free peanuts and the atmosphere is great .
i sat outside and it was just a really comfortable place to be .
everyone there was friendly and just relaxing .
service and atmosphere is the best part of the place .
... ca n't go wrong here !
i 've been going to the esquire for over _num_ years .
it 's because they have great drinks , delicious food and efficient friendly staff .
ladyluv
ha !
i tried their fried broccoli recently , it 's soooo addicting .
pub food experience .
the main problem is that it does n't have great beer .
it 's a fairly versatile place , good for happy hours .
delicious pineapple margarita and burgers .
ca n't go wrong !
i go to this bar every single time i 'm in champaign .
probably one of my favorite bars in champaign .
just make sure you have your id because they will card you !
update : the jukebox is now gone .
i am not happy .
ruthie aw harper ( unregistered ) says :

the place where everyone feels @ home ...
surprisingly good bar food .
good sandwiches and bag of chips .
cheap beer .
nostalgia gets me every time .
the draft beer selection was ok .
neither one was that great .
the staff was super friendly and great with the kids .
the price was also right .
every single visit to the esquire , i received unfriendly , uninviting service .
i tried the steak garden salad and the meat was cooked to perfection .
murphy 's pub , the blind pig , and others .
i would not put esquire on that list .
the decor is uninteresting at best .
there is no personality .
i was told the burgers were good .
the chicken must be avoided at all costs .
i 'm not entirely sure why , as this makes an awkward eating experience .
the strips were nearly tasteless .
thank goodness for mayonaise .
my wife had the wings .
these things had enough salt to turn lake michigan into a salt lake .
they were awful .
i would not go back at all .
meh .
give me some salty peanuts , pbr and mediterranean pizza from the esquire anytime !
best bar in town !
came to this place to end the night after celebrating a friend 's birthday .
shared fries , fried potstickers , pizza and chicken tenders .
the food was decent .
either that or i was starving - probably the latter .
the server was a bit pushy and had an attitude .
after we ate , we played a few rounds of pool .
i was stunned and asked my friends what was going on .
from how she was acting you would 've thought someone had gotten killed .
turns out my friend forgot to pay for pool .
she was out her damn mind yelling at us like she was crazy !
the way this woman acted was completely rude and unprofessional .
honestly do n't know how this place is still in business .
wish i could give this place _num_ stars .
yeah , it 's that bad .
i will not be coming back !
!
i have dietary restrictions and i need to be picky .
i came here with my mom and sister to grab some food on sunday .
it seemed to be the only place open .
the salmon only cost $ _num_ and it was a fairly big portion .
the servers were nice but the atmosphere was too load .
good food , great prices- nice relaxed atmosphere .
esquire is definitely a place to be visited when in champaign !
just got back from a great party at esquire .
the food was fantastic !
they have a good bar selection too ... i had good german beer .
... ... ... .mmm ok- it 's actually more of a watering hole .
you know , an acceptable environment within which to get your drank on .
i do n't remember my first visit to the esquire .
i suspect i 'm not alone , but my reasons probably differ .
luckily for me , i have been to esquire many more times since .
it 's all about the ambiance , really .
that and those peanuts .
for real .
this will be a review down memory lane .
i grew up in this bar , much like jackie h 's review .
then stomp on all the peanut shells on the floor .
i have seen expansion many times .
my parents originally met here .
it is safe to say my family has a mullti generational history here .
just a great place to relax and have a few drinks .
along with the evolution of the bar , so has the menu .
which i do n't think are that great .
though the various pizzas are very good .
as are the wings , which i am not typically a fan of .
though these are baked , not fried and battered like most .
the asian dumplings are great as well .
the service can be hit or miss .
depending on the time you come , and where you order .
drinks are pretty standard .
there are a handful of good micros on tap .
a bit more extensive selection in bottles .
the rest is typical drinks for a neighborhood bar .
overall , not perfect .
though the goods far out way the bad .
love this place .
i eat here at least _num_ times a week .
they 're to die for , and often the only thing i order here .
otherwise , the spirits and beer selections are okay .
the pool space is nice and open as well .
the food , on the other hand , has been consistently underwhelming .
the appetizers tend to be greasy , and the chicken fingers were weak .
plus food normally takes forever to come out of the oven .
in short , come for the booze , but eat beforehand .
coming from california , these are the cheapest drinks i 've ever encountered !
the pizza was pretty decent - thin crust .
we ordered the hawaiian although we substituted bbq sauce for regular pizza tomato sauce .
there are fun pool tables and other arcade games .
this place seems to be a staple of downtown champaign .
mostly great venue .
beer selection is good .
easy to get to .
food is ok. salmon is awesome .
there 's something quite nice about this place .
every pizza i 've had here has been really delicious .
but the bathrooms ... avoid the bathrooms .
kind of underwhelming place overall .
that being said , there is a nice energy throughout .
staff is great and service is prompt and friendly .
i do n't know why i bothered trying a second time .
so my main complaint about the lunch dining experience is sanitation .
i ordered the burger the first time and a hot dog the second .
stickyness galore .
wash your hands if you still decide to go .
anyway , minus food but fun joint .
great prices on drinks and food .
the thin crust pizza is delicious .
good selection of draft beers .
got ta admit that the name of the place belies what 's actually inside .
when i hear the word `` esquire , '' i think formal and gentlemen .
despite this , this place features some cool billiards .
my burger and fried mushroom meal came out to be $ _num_ .
my favorite bar .
i 've never left disappointed !
because , really , they have everything here at the esquire .
!
i feel like a rebel for making a mess , hehe .
) .
two thumbs up for esquire !
will definitely be back next time i 'm visiting champaign
their pizzas are pretty good -- thin crust .
get the bbq chicken .
the food is n't amazing but it 's pretty good for a lounge/bar .
i 've tried their sandwich as well with pulled pork .
this was very tasty !
had it during lunch time when it 's not too busy .
apparently they have a buffet lunch or something .
cool , chill place to check out in downtown champaign .
came on a friday night and it was really packed .
the seating area is kind of cramped ; chairs were often back-to-back .
their pizza is good , though , and they had decent drink prices .
came here after , . , jessica was excellent bartender .
quick , concerned , ,really knows how to make money !
let 's you drink a little before .
killing u with ordering ..at the bar ! ! ! ! .
she is awesome ! !
and will be on our _num_ % tip group .
erm .
esquire is rather hideous with an atmosphere not to my taste .
light wood ?
really ?
okay , that 's not a big deal .
i guess i 'm just not used to this feel .
i personally think their drink menu is shot .
kudos .
do n't come out to the esquire and not try this pizza !
great alcohol .
you all have lint butt .
cheap , good pub food .
do n't expect fancy .
they have a surprisingly good beer selection and infuse their own liquors .
seriously a must-try in chambana .
the super relaxed environment is definitely part of the appeal for me .
literally what it 's advertised as .
cheap , solid food , no frills .
super convenient location near the terminal .
this place is great for what it is .
cheap food , cheap beer and alcohol ( hefty wine pours !
) , and a nice atmosphere .
service was super fast .
salad was surprisingly fresh ( and only $ _num_ ! ) .
pizza was great .
throwing peanuts on the ground was fun .
overall , great experience .
it looked dmn good !
so on saturday i ordered one -- - sausage cheese and mushrooms..
so ( _num_ ) star !
sorry i did't tip him ...
but the female waitress had me shocked !
lol !
happy !
i go here whenever i 'm downtown and need smokes .
they are $ _num_ , but it 's right there .
last night was in there for dinner .
the lady again asked `` what do you want ? ''
so , we settled on esquire .
but is it really settling on esquire ?
the cheese sticks here are some of the best in town .
the asian dumplings are what makes me eat here .
do n't know why , but they are awesome .
she gets a grilled cheese .
i get the ribeye steak sammich .
it 's definitely a serviceable ribeye steak sammich .
i went with medium rare .
the grilled cheese is a grilled cheese .
nothing fancy , nothing bad .
they have triptych pretty nice little saturday on tap .
they always have pnls on tap .
did you want a pitcher of pnls , because you can get it here !
within the past _num_ years , their craft beer selection has vastly improved .
that 's probably to the dismay of several of their regulars .
esquire is the townie bar downtown .
it probably has the most eclectic mix of people .
after sporting events , the place is almost all orange on the inside .
not too many other bars downtown are that sports friendly .
it 's a comfort bar .
even though the chairs are n't that comfortable .
there 's pool .
there 's peanuts .
best neighborhood bar in cu by a long shot .
for a bar food bar , their pizza is ridiculously good .
try the blue pear ( warning , no red sauce ) .
the bar tender with the beard will take care of you .
crooked tree is always on tap !
why not five stars ?
cause the food is n't free ?
not sure .
will not return or recommend anyone else visits this establishment .
the food was average , nothing like what the other reviews here say .
we visited due to the outstanding yelp reviews , but were extremely disappointed .
this is one of my favorite spots in champaign .
if you like tomato soup , you have to come here .
they have a tomato bisque soup that is incredible !
definitely a most go to place
esquire is one of those bars that definitely grew on me .
ten years into champaign and i never really visited until last year .
however , i was pleasantly surprised .
there is always seating because this place is huge including an outdoor patio area .
just for that , i upped my star to four .
i believe in you esquire .
thank you for not letting me down .
the food is typical casual american fare , but the quality meets the prices .
service can be a bit snarky at times , though .
i love jupiter 's pizza .
lots of different excellent combinations available .
lots of good drinks to be had .
( bell 's ! )
lots of pool to be played .
why not _num_ stars ?
every time i go the service is horrendous .
absolutely terrible .
especially the pizzas with meat on them .
yes .
meat pizza .
i like the smoked salmon .
that is tragic .
i ca n't wait to go home again now that c-u is smoke-free .
however , if you like pool , these are very good tables .
this is a great stop towards the end of the night .
still one of the best pizza places in town .
great place to play pool .
this was always one of my favorite bars in downtown champaign .
some of the best thin crust i think i have had .
bar is nice and roomy , good place to play pool .
sadly many do n't make this transition .
tasty pizza , nice beer selection .
perfect for watching sports and playing pub games .
great bar .
pizza is great , thin crust .
best pizza in town imho ( not a big papa dels fan ) .
beer selection is so-so .
this place is a great place to grab a thin crust pizza with friends .
we are regulars , especially at their new location !
more seating !
jupiters is great !
i am still a fan .
this is the 2nd time i had to post a review of jupiters .
yelp took it down , though i have no idea why .
i wish we had a jupiters or equivalent in california .
my favorite is their sausage , schroom , bell pepper and onion pizza .
i hope yelp does n't take this review down this time .
great f-ing pizza .
that 's it , nuff said !
yes .
you win , jupiters .
happy hour special providing me with cheap yet delicious beer ?
check .
super cheap pizza , making life amazing ?
double check .
okay , jupiter 's has happy hour specials that are wondrous .
i got a magnificent large pizza for only $ _num_ .
and it was huuuuge .
how huge ?
for eight dollars !
seriously .
i always make a stop here whenever i 'm in town .
a perfect place to grab a bite with an old friend .
tuesday nights - half price large pizzas !
pool tables galore !
good thin crust pizza 's .
daily drink specials ( and the beer is always cheap ) .
lots of seating .
nice waitstaff .
any questions ?
i 've been here only once as of yet and i loved it !
i love their pizza menu .
i had a mustard base sauce pizza that was awesome !
i loved it .
nowhere else could i go for this pizza .
i think the environment is a lot of fun also .
the price is fair .
it 's _num_ for a personal pizza which a good size !
i 'm looking forward to coming back !
the best pizza in town .
amaaazing pizza !
the bianca is totally my jam .
they also have drink specials just about every night .
service is also solid too !
i like this place .
i stick to the basics , and they do that just fine .
but for whatever reason , i just really like the space .
great place to drink some beers and eat pizza .
jupiter 's pizza is awesome .
they also have pool tables and arcade games .
jupiter 's specialty pizzas are great !
more importantly , the price is very reasonable .
also this place has a clean , friendly , fun atmosphere .
it 's definitely one of my favorite places to go in downtown champaign .
had a fantastic late saturday evening here .
after 10pm , a large two topping pizza is $ _num_ .
this allowed me to get a large smoked salmon pizza for $ _num_ .
while it might not sound like a great combination , this pizza was fantastic .
drinks were n't expensive , and overall there was a good selection .
i ca n't wait to go again , fantastic pizza and reasonable drinks .
pizza is way overpriced .
if you like pizza bites , well heck , then dig in .
not only that , but food takes forever to come out .
the service was ok , but the atmosphere and food were n't anything special .
we also had a long wait to get a table and food .
it 's too small to be able to really play .
come here for some pizza before and after a night of drinking .
great pizza and friendly service .
the place is plenty big , so it does n't get too loud .
_num_ larges on fridays .
pool tables are in good shape which is nice for a bar .
do n't really have to wait to long to get a pool table
one of the best bar/restaurants i 've been to in champaign !
the pizza is cooked perfect , priced right , and served piping hott !
6+ professional pool tables and pinball arcade style games as well !
_num_ stars !
man was i surprised by the excellent food and great service !
bartenders are super friendly and serve up awesome drinks at great prices !
love the pizza cant wait to try the sandwiches ... will definitely return !
pizza is served california pizza kitchen-style .
some people play pool during lunch .
do n't play pool unless you 're at brother 's .
one of my favorite places in downtown champaign .
so much to do , so little time .
we had to learn that the hard way .
pizzas are solid .
hawaiian is my go to .
just your average sports bar .
my girlfriend enjoyed the thin crust pizza so that was good enough for me .
pretty large venue with plenty of seating .
friendly service .
very college-like .
they just get it perfect every time .
the decor is nice and makes for a nice ambiance .
good beer selection and pizza .
pool tables are some of the best in town .
overall great local place to go .
another institution in downtown champaign that has been here forever .
the bar area is nice with a few tables and big booths .
there is not a lot of sitting area if you come at peak hours .
so be warned .
there is even a patio out back .
the building itself is ancient , and tons of character .
the servers work hard , and are very friendly .
though can get swamped during peak hours .
just a couple of decent beers on tap .
the pizzas are great .
crispy , thin crust that is awesome .
the specialty pizzas like pizza pesto is great .
ca n't go wrong making your own as well .
they come in personal , _num_ '' , and _num_ . ''
always a good stop downtown for pizza , beer , and fun .
awesome .
: (
but staff are usually friendly .
good pizza .
it 's thing crust with nice crunch .
normally i 'm not a thin crust fan but this was surprisingly good .
luckily we got seats at the bar .
we just had to wear our coats throughout dinner .
so a large probably feeds _num_ people comfortably , _num_ uncomfortably .
we said no and assumed she would bring us the check .
but did n't and we sat there for like _num_ more minutes .
had to grab her attention and then ask for the check .
minor inconvenience though so it 's whatever .
good pizza !
nice , comfy atmosphere !
prices arent bad !
good service ! !
convenient location !
i like to make my own pizza ...
cream sauce , tomatoes , spinach , mushrooms and cheese !
mmmmmmm !
i lived in the nyc for some time , and this pizza is thin !
fun place with friends
last night we thought we 'd try jupiter 's .
the big-screen tvs are prevalent and made watching the game easy .
there are plenty of billiards tables in the summer when the students are gone .
the pizza however was only okay .
the pizza was pretty good .
so why two stars ?
just awful .
i 'll never go back .
amazing thin crust pizza !
we moved to ca and can not find anything even close !
good salty meats and delicious sauce !
worth the half off tues. guys ... real cheese in those shakers .
nuff said .
okay , i tend to write about places that i like .
i really like this place .
i was surprised that i had n't heard much about it before .
i tried the pesto margarita personal size pizza and i loved it .
maybe it is on busy days ?
the service was good , very unintrusive , which was nice .
i could even imagine studying here as a treat to myself .
definitely on my list to recommend to others .
the thin-crust pizza is fantastic , and reasonably priced .
_num_ things i love .
good pizza and billiards .
and this place has both .
i would have given jupiter 's _num_ or _num_ stars for the pizza .
but they probably have the rudest waitress in champaign .
the other jupiters location is much better as a restaurant .
if you want a drink or play pool , then it would get 5/5 .
went with kids so we are just checking out their arcade games .
very basic and not really fun as an adult to play .
pizza is soso and pricy .
be forewarned .
it 's cracker crust pizza .
but of course , this also sounds like a pretty horrible idea .
i have no idea what 's good about this .
oh , does n't lunchables do a a pizza lunch ?
there you go , it 's kind of like that .
came here after a wedding reception , in need of some grub .
it was fairly tasty .
she seemed annoyed i brought this up .
check that bill , people .
so that 's your atmosphere .
i bought and paid for one beer .
i get home and they had charged me _num_ dollars .
would have been nice to know before they did it .
epic fail on their part , last time i go to that dive .
if thin crust is your thing , this place is hard to beat .
wise choice , it was perfection .
however , i think it 's pretty hard to go wrong at jupiter 's .
if not , possibly pick up ?
a very consistant pool bar with great pizza .
my family loved the atmosphere , design , food , and staff .
i do commend their varying selection of toppings for their pizza .
either way , it made the pizza just taste mediocre .
this not thin crust pizza .
this was cardboard crust pizza .
delicious pizza , fun atmosphere , good beer .
will be back again soon for sure !
i recommend the prosciutto di parma pizza and the bbq chicken pizza .
yummyyyy
jupiter 's is a great place for any crowd of people .
they also have about _num_ pool tables where you can enjoy a few games .
their pizza is very good .
they 're famous for their thing sliced pizza .
they have an unlimited selection of toppings and sauces .
they also run great deals like half price large pizzas on tuesdays .
my only complaint about this place is the speed of service .
the service was just okay ; our server was n't the most attentive .
the pizza was good , but could 've used more toppings .
overall , a little pricey but fun for the kids and grown ups .
the pool rates are inexpensive at only $ _num_ per hour .
the atmosphere is generally good .
they have the best pizza !
they are the thinnest crispy pizza .
we go to tuesday 's half off pizza day .
this is my favorite thin crust pizza in the area .
the place is almost always empty so the service is pretty quick .
even after an early football game , we get fed pretty quickly .
it makes a good lunch spot after church too !
great variety of pizza .
great beers on table .
pool tables everywhere and readily available .
what 's not to love ?
jupiter 's was always a favorite when going out .
great games , lots of pool tables ( esp .
what does , though , is their service .
super slow .
it offers some great entertainment , with some good refreshment ( albeit expensive ! !
) , with the option of a thin crust pizza !
totally a three-starer !
the atmosphere is also very nice .
relaxed .
mostly old people , townies .
it 's clean as well .
but the pizza is much too small for the price .
maybe someone with a normal sized appetite can chime in .
update : i think i found out why i thought it was overpriced .
but was charged over $ _num_ .
why ?
here 's the link to their menu with the prices : http : //www.jupiterspizza.com/downtown/menu.html
i got a custom 4-topping personal which should have been about $ _num_ tops .
just not cool .
but jupiter 's food is not good enough to justify capricious pricing .
yet if you want super , super thin pizza , it is delicious ! !
so many delicious options .
i think tuesday nights are half off , so it is so worth it .
the pizzas are tasty , a good offering for a thin-crust style .
my favorites are the preferito and bbq chicken .
i was in town for an event and decided to grab a quick bite .
and guess what ?
thank you so much for such an awesome service and good food !
how have i not yet reviewed this place ? !
lousy service !
went here on a tues. night about 6:20 pm .
sign says : seat yourself .
difficult to do when there are no tables available .
got a booth by the kitchen , very dark .
hard to get service .
ordered a house salad w/ no cucumbers & no croutons .
salad came w/ a mountain of cheese .
menu did not say anything about cheese .
salad # _num_ came out with no onions .
i specifically asked for onions .
trying to flag down my server was difficult .
i told her to take it off my bill .
pizza came , it was ok , but crust was tough .
ie .
they did good .
: d mariah took care of us and everything went smoothly .
great crisp/crust .
overall , a great place and great service !
a very quick , painless and easy place to get your foid card .
the staff was also super friendly .
thumbs down
this place charges a fee of $ _num_ to do basically nothing .
this place is foolish and should not exist as a business .
they lost my plates in the mail .
the time it takes for them to process the paper work is ridiculous .
i will never return to you becks , because you failed .
avoid !
i finally contacted the state of illinois dmv and no paperwork has been submitted !
looks like i 'll need to pick up a lawyer .
thanks for the hassle beck 's !
i call beck 's my little hidden gem in c-u .
the staff is quick & courteous .
this place is ridiculous .
so unorganized !
worth a look !
there was a little bit of a wait but no more than 10-15 minutes .
good quality , fast haircut .
great location near campus .
$ _num_ tuesdays , $ _num_ men 's otherwise .
so i went to the cost cuttery by green and neil .
i had stephanie cut my hair .
she was friendly and gave me a pretty good hair cut quickly .
there was no wash or style but i saved myself about $ _num_ .
i would go back for a cut again .
i loved this place from the moment i walked in .
such hospitality and kindness .
stephanie was great , she took my information and promptly helped me .
not only all of that , but the haircut was great !
i absolutely recommend this place !
plus they have an $ _num_ special every tuesday !
fast , friendly and affordable .
they do a great job and i have no complaints .
keep up the great work .
great stylist , they know their stuff .
very affordable and stylist keep up with trends .
this location is awesome .
the people are always friendly and stephanie is very skilled .
not only is she friendly and talented , she is efficient !
i am so thankful i found her !
the staff always seem to enjoy their job .
they are very friendly and hospitable the moment you walk in the door .
i 'm not a regular in the city but i needed a haircut .
and with so many places i was n't sure where to go .
this place had great reviews and they really deserve it .
you do n't necessarily need an appointment , but i recommend calling before going .
just to make sure they 'll be available .
great experience !
i will return to cost cutters !
great value !
however it was such a disappointment .
my haircut was cut by a very young lady seems like apprentice .
i want to cry because my hair was so ugly !
scum company .
do yourself a huge favor and look elsewhere .
not worth it .
apartment was tiny .
horrible heating system .
what happened ?
i have to find a new apartment with little notice .
shady landlord .
do n't do it .
actually i do not even want to give one start for this place .
please do yourself a favour and look somewhere else .
such a bad place and such bad management .
have lived in apartment in so many states and they are the worst .
bacaro ( pronounced bah-kah-roh ' ) is a trendy little ultra-modern wine bar .
the food is largely excellent , though portions are modest .
and prices are rather reasonable , though not great .
one of the few places in champaign to test your palette .
the food is rather smart and inventive .
the interior is very reminiscent of blackbird in chicago .
another great experience last night at bacaro .
over the top with wine and interesting food .
very expensive and not particularly large dishes .
the food is really good and the interior is very stylish .
also , the service is great .
i had the _num_ course tasting flight tonight at bacaro and it was incredible .
this place was a bit of a disappointment for me .
i definitely would n't go back here , but it was an interesting experience .
food items are less adventurous and price point has increased with time .
service i have always found to be very good and knowledgeable , esp .
about wine .
) /wine lounge/private dining salon will go .
the first course , a shrimp bruschetta , was amazing .
it had a wonderful spicy and tangy flavor accented with some unexpected mint leaves .
unfortunately , the main course left much to be desired .
my companion 's lobster ravioli was well executed , but bland .
however , my cavatappi was nearly inexcusable .
dessert was an ice cream sandwich made with snickerdoodle cookies .
service was attentive , if a little pretentious .
but everything was overshadowed by the cavatappi .
just because we are students does n't mean we do n't deserve good food .
i 've had fantastic entrees for less at other places in cu .
i have never ever had a bad dish here .
they seem to be particular to detail , which is a plus to me !
the wine is top notch too .
good lord , fine dining people ! !
you pay for what you get .
also ! !
respect that !
!
i think i need to save to go there again , so worth it !
!
until then , i say stick with radio maria .
_num_ 1/2 stars .
i used to think it was _num_ .
i ordered duck , which arrived totally well done ( so bizarre ) .
when i complained about it , nothing was done .
i was horrified .
seriously ...
i 'm still salivating thinking about it .
first and foremost : the food .
my boyfriend and i decided to share a bunch of dishes .
that was some seriously great food !
!
as bacaro is also a wine lounge , their wine selection is quite extensive .
by far the restaurant in champaign , in my opinion .
i 'll definitely be back .
decent food , but not spectacular .
i think the wine here is better .
had a really awesome special pinot grigio with literally peaches floating around ! ! !
it was so great .
i have to come back here to try more of their wines .
i think it 's probably better to come here just for wine than for dinner
and like what everyone else said , the service was great !
expensive food but quite delicious and well presented .
the waitress made a great wine selection to go with our food .
the restaurant is n't very big , the decor is modern .
this place is amazing .
i 've only been their twice since each meal costs half a months rent .
it 's totally worth it though .
at bacaro we got blown away at how awesome the two desserts were .
waitress was fast , and courteous .
another plus is they serve french press coffee !
my second dessert trip was also perfect .
they were both perfection .
so calming and chill !
the waitstaff all seems super nice , and well-informed about the menu .
i want to try dinner here too but have n't been that adventurous .
i 'll update if i do !
i was so incredibly disappointed .
if you want ribeye , go to jim gould 's .
their mashed potatoes were very much like the kind you make from a box .
it is also so small .
i ca n't help but feel this restaurant has fooled many .
i 've been to italy , and this is n't italian ...
i suppose the entire visit was lackluster .
when questioned , we were told `` they asked for doubles . ''
who orders a double merlot ?
what arrived at the table was a glorified ham and cheese sandwich .
i am trying to think of what to add that has n't been said ...
i think this is one of the outstanding restaurants in champaign-urbana .
overall , they rock .
this is not the typical `` american-italian '' restaurant .
as this would indicate , the menu changes frequently .
this is not an all-you-can eat for cheap place .
prices reflect the cost of quality ingredients and a skilled staff .
there 's a nice wine list that favors italian varieties .
the staff can make good recommendations .
i have to save a star ; there are better restaurants in the world .
what do all of these places have in common ?
bacaro does not cut corners where quality is concerned .
enjoy .
on to the wine , which is my favorite subject .
cu deserves more than jameson and pbr .
la dolce vita .
if not , i recommend you head straight to www.steaknshake.com
it is very inexpensive and has very large portions .
enjoy !
i do n't see what all the fuss is about .
i lived in chicago for many years so maybe i 'm spoiled .
third friend had a seafood risotto that was the best of the three entrees .
waiter was nice but new i would guess because he seemed nervous .
not rushing back any time soon .
a consummate professional .
she was also miss champaign county at the county fair a few years ago .
very impressive , even for this guy who lives and eats in downtown chicago .
the food came in very small portions , but it tasted good .
the $ _num_ pork belly appetizer was smaller than a golf ball .
very weird , but pretty cool for champaign , illinois .
i will be back .
i may be a cynic , but it raises red flags ... .
the waitress was wonderful .
but good , like a chunk of fried bacon fat .
then we had three entrees , all were very good .
my only complaint was the waitress was a complete moron .
i am very forgiving of servers too , being a former one myself .
i had the veal and it was wonderful .
the menu was confusing , but overall the food was excellent .
my only complaint with bacaro is the service .
our waitress was attentive , but a complete airhead .
bacaro has been through some subtle but incredibly effective changes .
bacaro could compete on a world stage , and do very well .
nice , elegant , cozy place to dine .
the food was a little salty but very original and tasty .
service was a tad slow and not timed well but it was very busy .
i eat out a lot , and i always look forward to eating here .
i also like that the menu is never the same twice .
i like the decor .
it was done tastefully , and with some thought .
small menu , but you end up wanting everything on it .
i waited for _num_ minutes even though i had a reservation .
all in all , not the greatest .
my boyfriend took me to bacaro for an amazingly romantic dinner date .
i was impressed with the atmosphere , the knowledgable waitstaff , and flavorful .
i would definitely return .
hmmm , what to say , what to say .
the menu was very nice .
the service was excellent .
my companion suffered the same fate .
we ended up drinking beer because we could not find anything we liked .
my date secured us a reservation here for valentines day .
pretentious .
server was snooty , bar man was snooty .
the patrons also the same .
crammed seating .
seriously , $ _num_ for a chicken leg ?
no thank you .
other then that , meh .
tranquil , calm and romantic
wine bar is pretty decent and deserts taste good .
here 's what we ordered :
grilled veal chop with red beets and pearl onions
apple cake with creme fraiche ice cream
chocolate brownie with graham cracker ice cream and roasted marshmallows
persimmon and pistachio bread pudding
it was just plain soggy and tasteless .
i recommend not ordering dessert here if you do plan on coming .
the atmosphere was pleasant and the ambient music was suitable for the occasion .
excellent service .
of course it is pricey but it is worth it .
food was excellent .
_num_ of us had a fantastic time at this restaurant last night .
the resounding favorite was the octopus appetizer which was tender and flavor- full .
the seared scallops with myers lemon were refreshing and light .
pretty good food but a bit pricey for what you get .
i ca n't wait to go back .
i ca n't complain about the prices .
the food was expensive ; the food was good .
the good : the food .
three people , three different dishes , and everybody liked theirs .
either way you should call ahead and see .
i have no complaints about oversalting like other reviewers , perhaps they listened ?
the malbec we drank with dinner was a nice random choice .
the bad : our waitress was new .
at least i hope she was new .
the manhattans were terrible .
this is no time for creativity .
the dessert menu is stupid .
who follows octopus and rabbit with banana bread and ice cream ?
hire a dessert chef .
i would totally recommend bacaro if you need `` fancy dinner out . ''
sometimes i do .
sometimes i have parents who need impressing .
this is , hands down , the best restaurant in champaign right now .
i go frequently and will continue to go .
way to go bacaro !
hopefully they do n't do that anymore .
since then i move to stockholm and then new york city .
it was really very good .
champaign-urbana has fantastic terroir .
i loved the goat cheese salad and my rich creamy risotto .
fried sweetbreads were luscious .
my boyfriend 's chicken with chicken liver was delicious .
i rather enjoyed bacaro .
it had a really nice atmosphere , quality food , and good wine .
the pairing was correct and the wine went well with our meals .
this is a very good place to eat in the champaign area .
this is our favorite restaurant in champaign-urbana .
a little pricey , but worth every penny .
and the desserts -- so delicious .
the desserts truly capture the seasons and the feel of the weather so perfectly .
i honestly do n't know a better way to start the week !
and your spirits will be lifted .
market menu ! ! )
and i have never been disappointed .
the service is great , and they are very attentive .
i think you definitely get what you pay for .
and for a city like champaign , bacaro is definitely a lovely gem .
it is a beautiful , modern looking restaurant .
but first strike happened right off the bat with the hostess .
no one was at the two tables next to us .
it was awkward all evening being that close to two other tables .
i 'm sure she was one tired girl by the end of the evening .
fourth strike -- we do n't drink and ordered ice teas .
no sugar offered and she was so busy we hated to even bother her .
finally at some point we managed to sneak in the ask .
but why did we have to ask .
awkward moment .
so after hem hawing a moment she finally headed to the kitchen to ask .
`` soup nazi '' ? ! )
fortunately , they were able to accept my request .
the dinner started off with an amuse bouche of a tiny square of frittata .
i noticed on the menu that it was $ _num_ and thought hmm ... ..
that 's the kind of dinner my husband had at bacaro .
and nothing else .
he was stil hungry after he ate it .
for champaign , this is the best food around .
the monday arket menu is a great price too .
the staff is not pretentious which is always nice to see .
this is a diamond in the c-u rough .
awesome .
the food was interesting , nicely presented , perfectly portioned and delicious !
we had the chef 's tasting menu and i 'm so happy we did .
i 'd definitely recommend this place !
overall , it is a consistently good restaurant in terms of service .
however , there are certain dishes that are more tasty than others .
fantastic !
we finally made time last night .
atmosphere : _num_ stars .
great atmosphere , dimly lit , very nice .
snooty .
quality and kind ... just the kind of service we adore .
food : perfect .
i 'm not a `` foody '' but i adore good food .
the octopus was the best i 've ever had .
the gnocchi was incredibly savory .
my husband tried the steak and i had the lamb special .
both were fantastic .
wine suggestion : _num_ stars .
wine was good , not great .
i 'm not sure if we failed to describe what we wanted .
would be nice to have some descriptions in the wine menu .
this is such a minor point though .
we did not eat dessert as we were stuffed .
i ca n't say enough good things about this very very special restaurant .
we will be back ... this is now my favorite restaurant in champaign urbana !
!
i wish i could give bacaro five stars .
to be fair , there 's a lot to like about it .
the quality of the ingredients is high .
the ambience is great too .
the servers are among the most professional in the c-u area .
the food is genuinely sophisticated .
the menu at bacaro is constantly changing based on what ingredients they stock .
this tends to result in inconsistent dishes whose preparations are constantly changing .
of three visits i 've eaten some bad , ok and great meals .
visit _num_ :
had halibut with some kind of crust in a mint-gazpacho .
the fish was fresh and of excellent quality .
the gazpacho was also greasy and was not pleasantly minty .
fantastic ingredients but badly executed prep .
visit _num_ :
valentine 's day prix-fixe .
three courses all of which were delicious .
delicious and fresh !
my main was halibut again , with some kind of vanilla saffron sauce .
the fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce was complex and homey .
visit _num_ :
pork loin with mustard spaetzle .
the spaetzle were delicious !
i could eat that spaetzle every day .
the pork however was dry .
really , really dry .
it was that dry .
if the food was consistent , bacaro would be an easy 5-stars .
went here for 1-year anniversary .
over-priced food where _num_ and _num_ year old townies and professors eat .
you 've been warned .
overpriced .
the atmosphere is great , but the food is too buttery and overpriced .
i went there twice last year .
i only gave it five stars because i can only give five stars .
i wish i could take this restaurant with me on the road .
it was a pleasure to have this restaurant available in the middle of illinois .
the scallops and pork were delicious .
the grilled octopus salad is a must .
portions are not huge , but adequate .
in my party , one person have the ribeye .
it was fantastic .
the other person had the grilled salmon and it was equally good .
all in all this restaurant must not be missed .
by far , best restaurant in cu .
i felt decidedly underwhelmed and overcharged .
this place blew my mind it was so good .
i paired it with the wines too .
the wine list was definitely impressive .
lots of interesting wines at very fair prices .
the wines paired perfectly with each dish , i was so happy .
about the food ...
i was just so impressed .
the rib eye for the main course was flavorful and again very tender .
the cheese course was fun .
and i loved thin very rich slice of chocolate dessert .
to be honest , i was simply amazed at the quality of these dishes .
this is easily one of my most memorable and favorite dining experiences .
easily _num_ stars for bacaro !
!
i am from dallas and in champaign for business .
i thought it was great .
unique tasty dishes !
this is the perfect place to stop in after a long
day of visiting family and friends .
not too noisy ,
good food , and any beverage you like .
we did n't
order entrees just appetizers and salad .
they
still sent out an amuse-bouche and sliced baguette
with olive oil .
nice .
we wish we would have been
hungry enough for a full dinner but we had been
eating all day long .
next time i think i will budget
my stomach space and leave some room for bacaro .
you should too .
food was excellent and the atmosphere was very warm and pleasant .
portions were reasonable , but not huge .
wine is half price on sundays by the way !
definitely a great dinner date location .
food was very good and presentation is excellent .
this is champaign 's version of a manhattan bistro .
i ordered duck and my boyfriend ordered the beef fillet .
they were both very good .
we also shared an appetizer , octopus salad .
service was awesome .
i made reservation in the morning .
and it was full at dinner time .
perfect restaurant for dates .
second trip to bacaro .
prix fixe dinner for two with the cheapest bottle of wine on the menu .
$ _num_
we left hungry , and shaking our heads .
walked across the street to esquire and had dinner again .
this is our favorite restaurant in champaign , hands down the best food .
we ordered the tasting menu and were not disappointed .
seven courses and all were expertly prepared .
staff was friendly and courteous ... . we 'll definitely be back .
ridiculous .
beautiful ambience , beautiful waitress , beautiful food .
perfect amounts .
attentive .
just perfect .
i liked the experience at bacaro .
the steak was excellent .
bacaro 's cuisine is innovative and delicious !
appropriate proportions are creatively presented .
the service and ambiance are the tops !
clean , engaging art , cool bar !
great people watching can be had on their outdoor terrace .
food was excellent but did not have a great experience with waitress .
table of _num_ , we all ordered tasting menu with wine pairings .
off .
water was slow to be refilled .
say what ? ? ?
i believe your customers are your priority !
i always love bacaro !
the wine is half price on sundays so i had _num_ glasses .
the pinot noir was delightful and the cab sauv was decent as well .
for dinner , the risotto with rabbit was tasty .
dessert was a red velvet ice cream cake .
it was okay .
oh well , maybe next time .
overall , a great spot for good food and drink .
i had a lovely anniversary dinner here a few years back .
i remember the pumpkin ravioli being delicious and the waiter service being great .
portions are relatively small , though .
i love that they use local ingredients and keep their menu small and creative .
food was excellent but did not have a great experience with waitress .
table of _num_ , we all ordered tasting menu with wine pairings .
off .
water was slow to be refilled .
say what ? ? ?
i believe your customers are your priority !
just wanted to post an update .
we definitely will give them another chance .
again- the food is amazing and we want to see them succeed .
based strictly on the menu i was really hoping for a great dinner .
however , i was really disappointed with the our dinner .
my wife had the chicken and i had the ribeye .
my steak was n't very tender or all that flavorful .
her chicken was cooked decently enough but again the flavor was really just average .
the atmosphere and the waiter we had were very nice .
so here is my take .
wait staff 3-4 stars
atmosphere 4-5 stars
wine list 4-5 stars
beer list 3-4 stars
menu 4-5 stars
food 2-3 stars
unfortunately bacaro is not one of those places .
my recommendation is avoid because there is way too much attitude here .
in a college town !
that said , this could be a product of where i sat .
used yelp to find this place and was not disappointed .
very good food and service meant for a great time .
will definitely go back when in champaign again .
we had an absolutely great meal at bacaros !
we went all vegetarian but the mushrooms , beets , and prizetta were awesome !
wine list was very good .
food was excellent .
service was great .
atmosphere was great .
will go again .
i wold recommend this to anyone .
i was very pleasantly surprised .
great service , great atmosphere and amazing food !
awesome place !
always incredible .
our favorite restaurant in champaign .
food ranges from very good to amazing .
we 've never had a bad meal at bacaro .
highly recommended .
we were forced to listen to a guest m.d .
it was a very unpleasant dinner .
a good restaurant is not just about food , but also about ambience .
the soup was also extremely salty .
would highly recommend !
food , wine , presentation and service were exceptional !
enjoy !
i 've taken my wife here on two occasions .
and both times the food and wine parings was amazing .
the look of excitement on my wife face was priceless .
thanks bacaro .
yeah ... so what , i have only eaten here twice .
like there could be a bad meal from this spot .
staff is awesome , all of them .
front of house , back of house , big props .
presentation , quantity , ambiance , vibe , wine , champagne .
this is a comfortable yummy spot .
i ca n't wait .
done shun
a wonderful place to take a date .
romantic , quiet , and a wonderful wine selection .
over the weekend i took a date here for dinner .
we both had the filet .
it was wonderful !
cooked to perfection , and melted in our mouths .
not to mention , we washed it down with a great cabernet .
i would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys an upscale experience .
: )
first , i love the extensive wine selection !
their bottle selection is really impressive .
we had the pizzetta for an appetizer which has a great combination of flavors !
i also loved the risotto , it was amazing !
the overall ambiance is beautiful , altho it was a tad bit loud .
the service was excellent .
overall , definitely recommend it for a romantic date night .
the best restaurant in champaign-urbana if you do n't mind the price .
chocolate cake and bacon ?
not as good as chocolate cake without bacon .
this review is extra late .
i came here with my friend when he was visiting from san francisco .
we had their market monday menu since it was monday .
i do n't remember which wine it was since this was so long ago .
overall , a nice , quiet dining experience .
there are not a lot of really nice dinning restaurants in champaign .
the menu is seasonal and changes at least _num_ times per year .
all made fresh , nothing frozen .
i would like to see more variety .
we also had the peas and carrots .
very light and extremely tasty !
nice atmosphere and friendly staff !
we will definitely come back ! !
!
wonderful combinations of local ingredients ; menu evolves with availability .
quiet , stylish , atmopshere .
sunday 1/2 price wine by the glass is a great deal .
you wo n't regret going to bacaro .
this place would do well in chicago or any other `` foodie '' city .
been here many times before and so had certain expectations .
food , service , and ambience always excellent .
well tonight things went quite differently .
it was looking like a total disaster .
issues with food service reservations etc .
then rose ( asst mgr ) came to the rescue .
within a few minutes everything was made right .
loved bacaro before , love them even more now .
definitely will be back .
rose was simply amazing !
the finest dining restaurant anywhere around .
the farm to table cousine is perfectly prepared .
this is a prime example of `` you get what you pay for '' .
type of dining .
cocktails are consistently delicious and the wine recommendations are excellent .
full confession .
well , sweet jesus it was awesome !
$ _num_ including a drink .
so good !
get over there and give it a try .
this restaurant is sort of hit and miss .
i have had some really spectacular pasta with sea urchin .
and some fairly mediocre short ribs .
the portions on the other hand ... ridiculous .
otherwise , there are restaurants that offer greater value and dining experience in chambana .
chef morrow uses locally grown fresh veggies + herbs in his wonderful menus .
last night , we tried the monday market menu :
november _num_ _num_
butternut squash cake
crispy quinoa , sage , pecans
pork terrine
braised brussels sprouts , oyster mushrooms , pumpkin vinaigrette
cauliflower tortelli
brown butter , balsamic , hazelnuts , oregano , parmigiano reggiano
smoked turkey breast
white bean brioche stuffing , spinach , cranberry gastrique
sweet potato creme brulee
tonga island vanilla bean , caramelized sugar
each dish was prepared and served with care .
our server , kate , was attentive and kind .
very delicious and great presentations of each .
thank you to everyone on the staff for a lovely evening .
meh .
did n't knock my socks off .
we decided in the tasting menu and each got the wine pairing .
there were seven courses on the tasting menu , including a dessert .
the atmosphere was great .
i was surprised to find this gem in cu .
restaurant review
i still ca n't decide whether this is a _num_ or _num_ star restaurant .
you pay quite a premium for the dish that are notably small .
our dinner meeting was held at this location .
this cost _num_ dollars and the portion size was very small .
once again the portion size was quite small as you see from my picture .
pros : local sustained food , changing menu
hidden deals :
the wine menu was large and the waiter was very attentive .
i ordered a very good glass of riesling .
which is pricewise on the high side .
they brought bread to our table with olive oil .
the bread was very fresh and the oil was high grade .
my husband ordered house made gnocchi that came with pork .
i ordered a ravioli stuffed with bacon and several fresh vegetables .
we did n't order dessert , as we are n't dessert people .
i just am not super impressed with the portions or the prices .
we ate there on a whim a while back .
we walked bye and the place was empty .
so we decided to give it a try rather than our initial option .
staff was very snooty to us because did n't have reservstions .
at first they said they were booked .
again , the place was completley empty .
two tables total seated eating .
after _num_ people and much talking they sat us .
price was very high .
food was average .
service was extremely slow .
the place never got more than half full .
not sure what they consider booked .
not worth the money .
we went for a market monday tasting menu meal with wine pairings .
everything was fabulous from start to finish .
it is velvety smooth .
they served an outstanding meal .
bacaro is definitely the place to treat yourself , which never disappoints .
amazing food .
rotating menu with wine recommendations .
large wine selection .
professional staff .
save room for dessert !
i would definitely get the lamb porchetta again and the panna cotta for sure .
good place for dates .
the atmosphere is good and the service is excellent .
the food was incredibly good .
the servers and bartenders were knowledgeable and attentive .
we spent _num_ hours eating our _num_ course meal .
it 's a place where dining is an experience .
come here expecting that , and come hungry .
just drank some wine there .
the bartenders were very nice .
the ambiance and atmosphere is very good .
planning to have a dinner or brunch there .
amazing food and staff ! !
can wait to go again and try more great food ! !
truffle fries were so fabulous !
we went for our first anniversary .
really kudos there .
portions are small - you probably would expect that in this sort of establishment .
we opted for a la carte options .
this is champaign , a small but charming place in central illinois .
the food was great .
everything was jam packed with flavor , perfectly cooked , and elegantly presented .
would definitely return for another 'date night ' or special occasion .
this place is one of our favorite places to eat !
it was so thoughtful and sweet !
it is hard to find a restaurant that cares this much about it customers !
we each ordered the tasting menu and neither of us were disappointed .
everything we were served was amazing .
everything from the staff to the atmosphere was just simply wonderful .
i can not wait to go back again .
came here with a friend 's parents ( who were paying ! )
and we loved it .
the service was great and the food was amazing .
i just personally could generally not afford to come here as a student .
awesome spot to go if you want something a little more intimate and quiet .
good spot to bring a date .
menu changes with the seasons .
it was a couple weeks ago since i 've been .
server was evan he was awesome , super knowledgable and cool personality .
good food and atmosphere .
fantastic food .
the food comes slow on purpose .
abandon any thought of _num_ hour meal .
we were there _num_ hours .
it was awesome .
the proportions are n't `` central illinois '' they are regular heathy proportions .
slow down and enjoy the experience .
i had the best soup i 've ever tasted .
bring your rich relatives or boss who will pay .
expensive .
the food was very good but over priced for the market value .
over the experience was great lots of wine to choose from and pleasant atmosphere .
menu is comprehensive .
atmosphere intimate and quiet .
service pleasant .
food and service were spot on .
menu was simple yet diverse .
nice room .
the food , service , and atmosphere were excellent .
upscale dining for champaign-urbana area .
pricey , but worth it for a special occasion .
just a perfect dinning experience .
we had two pasta dishes off the menu .
the pasta was perfectly cooked and the flavors were excellent .
the starter was the celery soup , which was also excelent .
we paired it with a reasonably priced chianti wine .
overall one of the best dinning experiences i have in recent memory .
i had a pretty good meal here .
to start , i ordered the warm lobster and fennel `` salad . ''
for my entree , i ordered the duck with polenta and fried mushrooms .
i have to say , this was a pretty excellent dish .
they were crispy and chewy and added great texture and flavor to the dish .
for dessert , we had the donuts and the chocolate truffles on the table .
delicious , but not for the faint of heart .
however , i enjoyed bacaro and would return for a special occasion dinner .
dining in champaign has come a long way since i went to school here .
food was amazing .
awesome service .
pricing and portions were more on par with chicago so that was interesting .
this place was top notch .
service was attentive and quick .
food was excellent and presented well .
will definitely go again .
just all on the same menu .
kind of hard to explain .
good selection of wines and beers , plus margarias and sangria .
radio maria has great and unique food !
i went on a date here and absolutely loved it !
the selection of wines is excellent as well !
nice restaurant in downtown champaign .
has a really nice atmosphere .
good selection of wines .
i had the lamb once and that was a bit rough , not tender .
dessert menu was very standard .
i used to go [ almost ] every sunday for brunch .
phenomenal .
i still crave the beer bread .
and the masa boat
the interior is so artfully done .
i always found myself staring at the sculptural objects on the walls .
and the tables made with old doors .
very cool .
did lunch in their new tapas bar today .
i 'm not a big fan of being uncomfortable ... ever .
our waiter was great , in fact he added to my experience .
the interior is very well done for that particular genre .
the food , eh , nothing to write home about .
then shared a few tapas with my friend .
we had the pita triangles with hummus and the tuna salad sandwich .
the portions were acurately small .
flavor was good but again , nothing special .
radio maria is at the top of the restaurant heap in chambana for dinner .
top _num_ at least .
have n't been for lunch and i have n't experienced the tapas yet .
i love the atmosphere because it is understated and eclectic at the same time .
the radio hostess stand is lovely .
and i 'm a sucker for their crass-esque vintage graphic design .
excellent wine selection .
the reisling and gewuiztraminer are my favorites .
the service has always been friendly without being intrusive .
my food has always been cooked perfectly .
i ca n't say i agree with the claims that the menu is uninspired .
oh yeah , and delicious .
i went here for valentine 's day and was slightly disappointed .
we were also seated by the window and the heating was poor .
i also tried the tapas bar recently , which was a slightly better experience .
the salmon skewers with cucumber were perfectly spiced and delectable .
the balsamic fruit with manchego on bread was good as well .
however , the lamb skewers ... they were like meatloaf on a stick .
i 'm starting to think these guys spread themselves a bit too thin .
yikes !
unfortunately , most of us were underwhelmed with the food .
the mediocre food was made up for by the wonderful decor and overall experience .
i dearly loved this place when i lived in c-u .
what , you want me to do work ? ''
type .
the beer bread , yes , and the masa boat , yes !
they kickstarted a great trend .
downtown champaign would n't be what it is today without radio maria .
radio maria is a vast improvement .
we sat across a huge purple bar .
the menu was much different than i remembered .
instead of entrees like half chickens with grilled plantains , etc .
they offered tapas , which we did n't mind at all .
in fact , we love tapas .
the best tapas we ordered was the vegetarian paella .
the margarita i ordered was spot on .
not to strong , not to watered down .
and their prices are extremely reasonable .
i do n't even know what i 'm supposed to review here .
is it a restaurant ?
a tapas bar ?
and what 's with this sunday comfort food menu ?
do they even know anymore ?
i almost feel bad giving this jack of all trades only three stars .
you probably wo n't be disappointed .
but then there 's nothing about this place that 's outright great , either .
radio maria was the first restaurant downtown , and they did a fabulous job .
i will , inevitably , go back .
radio maria was one of the first restaurants in the current resurgence of downtown .
nice space , creative menu ( for cu ) , and some good servers .
now , the new tapas bar i like quite a bit .
both spaces are nice - they are adjacent to each other .
radio maria is definitely one of the nicest dining options in downtown champaign .
they also usually have a bunch specials , which i would recommend trying .
the service has also always been good .
4-1/2 stars .
i always get an omelette , which i always enjoy .
but eventually our food came , and he was very apologetic .
overall though , radio maria is not to be missed .
this place keeps getting better and better .
my favorites were the egg plant frittes and the seared scallops .
hopefully it wo n't be another _num_ years until i am back !
you can come here anytime at all and find something that suits your palette .
to sum it all up : *drooool* .
everything tasted fresh and light - just like breakfast should .
her praise hits often and reaches far .
tonight , we finally had dinner at the infamous champaign culinary sensation .
we started off sharing the mezze plate .
pita was pizza dough-y , but buttery too ... strange , in my opinion .
also , i found the couscous bland .
best part was the hummus , which i was wishing they served more of .
for dinner i ordered the crabcakes , which were more like crabballs .
goat cheese potato pancakes were crisp , but lacked seasoning .
more if i had extra aioli .
beau ordered the adobo pork .
like the roughage on my plate , the honey left his chayote-cilantro salad be .
radio maria makes me feel good .
there , i said it .
service at rm is impeccable .
their knowledgeable sommelier staff are very helpful for beginners and experienced wine-drinkers alike .
always order the special , their young , fashionable chefs always deliver .
after all , they have awesome sangria and great sunday brunch .
the tapas also taste great , but they always make me terribly sick afterward .
please , radio maria owners , read these reviews and take corrective action !
do not rest on your laurels because that way failure lies ...
everything becomes a mish-mash and it 's overwhelming and nothing stands out .
also , the pretty pretty people who work there do n't like kids .
when my eldest was a baby they had a beautiful vintage deathtrap highchair .
the restaurant itself is still lovely .
the food is pretty good , but the tapas i was not impressed by .
none of our drinks were refilled , and it took forever to order .
will prolly go back and hope that it 's a little better .
i really did like the atmosphere , and the food has potential .
our server who i wish i remembered his name was fantastic !
that was _num_ minutes later mind you .
love this place , always have .
one of the few restaurants that is consistently different .
i am not impressed with this place .
my friend and i walk into the bar side for tapas .
sure , we walk past several empty tables and sit at the empty bar .
and keeps walking by .
i asked another guy walking by for a glass of water .
it took quite awhile for just the drinks to get delivered .
i took a sip of an incredibly fruity red wine .
sigh ...
when the food arrived , it was alright .
maybe i just expect more .
it was okay food , just not as tasty as i 've had elsewhere .
just ... average .
the waitress asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu .
sure , why not .
we went with the dark chocolate cake .
about _num_ minutes later , we finally got the cake .
what took so long ?
who knows .
maybe they had to bake the cake after we ordered it ...
my friend said the cake tasted like deli meat to her .
how does one make cake taste like deli meat ?
i have no idea .
it tasted out right burnt to me .
i ask for the check .
she was sincere , it was just annoying .
i was n't impressed with the food , and somewhat unhappy with the service .
i do n't know if i would recommend this place .
maybe once just to go ... but i think once is enough .
the restaurant scene here has improved phenomenally .
the waitress was apologetic and nice enough about it .
we had n't been in the mood for tapas until we opened the menu .
surprisingly innovative , interesting and very hip .
the bar is lit in blue from beneath and the artwork was very urban/japanese .
check it out if you 're in town .
the waitstaff and service was also very friendly , young and attentive .
not very unique but good eats .
also , their drinks are marvelous .
pricey but innovative !
this place is honestly a world class spanish food/tapas place .
radio maria is my favorite restaurant in champaign .
the food is top-notch and the atmosphere is one of a kind .
but my wife and i had their valentine 's day menu this past weekend .
the food was great , but not for the outrageous cost .
normally the value/price ratio is excellent .
awesome decor - heard that the owner customized everything himself .
one caveat is that the portions are rather small .
first drink : arcadia porter .
pretty good .
decent price .
second drink : kilt lifter .
menu advertises : `` tastes like a cookie '' .
ok i 'm in the mood for sweet .
when i got it and tasted it : ewwuck .
completely flat .
and tasted like syrup .
not the you-put-on-your-pancakes-good-kind , but the high-fructose-corn-syrup-kind .
ewwuck .
me : can i trade this for something else ?
it 's really not good .
bartender _num_ : what do you mean ?
bartender _num_ : what is going on here .
me : this tastes like corn syrup .
bartender _num_ : the menu says `` tastes like a cookie ''
me : it tastes like robitussin .
have you tried it .
bartender _num_ walks away never to return
bartender _num_ : we ca n't _trade_ it .
it 's not like we can serve it to someone else .
it would be different if there was something wrong with it .
this beer tastes like robitussin ; how wrong do you have to get ?
your beer tastes like robitussin = wrong .
your cookie tastes like robitussin = wrong .
anything besides robitussin tasting like robitussin = wrong .
but hey , at least i got a better deal at radio maria 's .
if you want differential treatment , go here .
wine and beer list is plenty long and varied - flavors for everyone .
outside tables are great on a warm summer evening .
agree with 3+ stars .
some restaurants in this area have chicago-envy .
that must be the problem with radio maria .
dishes are overly complex and are either bland or actively taste bad .
the staff used to describe it as a caribbean-polish fusion .
( really . )
i have no idea what 's going on now .
spanish-korean ?
soul food middle eastern style ?
masa boats .
frog legs .
ground coffee rubs .
pad thai .
torta .
stay away !
delicious food , lovely atmosphere .
one of my top _num_ restaurants in champaign-urbana !
the food is good quality , and the flavor always delicious !
the desserts i 've had are lovely ; with good flavor and pretty presentation .
friendly people , good service .
note : many people have reviewed radio maria negatively .
i think they need to put it in context of local restaurants .
we 're in champaign-urbana , not new york or seattle .
i also think they need to stop being so negative .
viva radio maria !
: )
a great salsa dancing club in the evening hours !
$ _num_ to get in and then salsa dancing all night !
there 's a full bar if you get thirsty and two dance floors .
i will certainly try out lunch here at some point .
in the meantime , check it out on a friday or a saturday night !
radio maria has nice decor and an interesting menu .
both were very good .
my boyfriend got the eggplant fries .
they were so-so .
a little too greasy and the sauce was too sweet for me .
my only complaint is that the service was painfully slow .
there seemed to be one server for the entire place .
we sat there forever just waiting to order our food .
brunch !
ok , first , we have to discuss the breakfast potatoes .
wrong .
i ate every last morsel .
are so unreasonably delicious .
secondly , just about any option could be made vegetarian .
bonus points for that , maria !
our lovely brunch was reasonably priced as well .
great food , not overly pricey , and thoroughly enjoyable .
for this , it gets at least one more star to land at _num_ .
had the chance to visit this restaurant on a sunday night .
but sure enough , _num_ minutes later all our food arrives at once .
that 's a shame .
i 've been here _num_ times , mostly for brunch .
the waiters are my least favorite part of radio maria .
there are never enough people working at brunch .
the masa boat was a little dry , but the flavors were well-balanced .
i went once for dinner .
the food was good , but unremarkable .
i had the korean hot pot .
it was good , but i was n't expecting it to be sweet .
the portion sizes were also tiny .
oh radio maria , how i wish we could be in love .
radio maria is like the girl your friends try to set you up with .
you hear how beautiful , how wonderful she is .
this restaurant has all the makings of a high class experience .
it has a pretty bar with house-infused liquor .
( i especially love the ginger vodka . )
however , that 's where the magical journy ends .
you enter the restaurant only to be told to wait .
`` well , '' says the snooty hostess , `` those are reserved . ''
really ?
you have half of your restaurant empty and those are all reserved ?
ok , i 'll bite .
at the bar , we order two delicious drinks .
sure , i do n't mind that this one has food spilled on it .
will we go back ?
well ... .no .
the sangria here is awful .
i think it was a tequila sunrise .
the food is greasy and not in a good way .
the only thing good was the goat cheese .
but it is goat cheese .
how can you mess that up ?
the food is amazing and priced very well .
the bar is a blast and the staff is very friendly .
we usually sit at the bar and order up tapas and drinks .
the food is good and priced right .
the atmosphere is also wonderful , and very unique .
they also serve brunch , which is great !
eh .
i have some issues with this place .
it has really good potential but i definitely have mood swings about it .
the main restaurant is decent .
also , the wine selection is pretty decent .
but , i think the tapas side is just terrible .
the biggest issue was that we were served the spanish tortilla omelet refrigerator cold .
it is supposed to be grilled .
not grilled then put in the fridge over the weekend !
alrighty then !
not me ! !
) .
i like radio maria .
the hummus is sooo good- and they serve it with toasted pita .
the cheesecake was delicious .
i drank orange frescas , and did a lemon drop shot .
please please go here over boltini- much less pretentious .
good atmosphere but the food is overpriced and midiocre .
excellent choice .
great and tasty tapas menu with a wide beer selection .
good service that is n't in your face .
highly recommend the pita chips and hummus .
i love the traditional dining at radio maria .
does it sometimes take longer than other restaurants ?
yes ... but that makes it more enjoyable and relaxing .
it is nice to sit outside and have a nice , paced dinner .
i 'm always pleased with the specials .
the service is attentive without being overbearing .
i would recommend rm for couples wanting a nice dinner out .
went for brunch and would definitely recommend it .
the beer bread was very tasty .
we 'll definitely be going back and try some other things .
radio maria 's has a pretty extensive breakfast and lunch menu .
my meal here was phenomenal .
i got the masa boat surprise .
my wife got the fish tacos .
the masa boat was nothing short of amazing .
that is perfect omelet in my opinion .
the dish also included black beans , yummy potatoes , and salsa .
all for only $ _num_ .
nice upscale-casual place in the heart of downtown champaign .
all were delicious and well presented .
my warm chocolate cake dessert , however , tasted soggy and generally unpleasant .
our server tonight did a thoroughly wonderful job .
the lock was also broken .
holistically , though , i had a great dining experience here .
spaces numbered _num_ through _num_ are reserved for this restaurant 's patrons .
it was .
the spanish tortilla was burnt .
luckily , the harissa helped cover up the carcinogens .
at least it 's beautiful outside .
i remember when this place opened .
staff were humans who treated customers as if they were a recognizable species .
meals were fun .
but now ?
a facade that seems to be happy with the graduates of applebees .
my problem is i remember how much better it once was .
i miss the unique , creative , and delicious food in a friendly atmosphere .
but thankfully this was not the case !
i 'd definitely return here on a trip to the twin city area .
ate here on a visit from seattle and was very impressed .
the gnocchi was outstanding .
the prawns with the bacon , amazing .
great tapas .
i want to go back for more .
wish they had better hours though .
the parking lot attendant was rude .
could n't wait in my car to wait for my friend to arrive .
made me not want to go into the restaurant , so i did n't .
awesome beer and wine selection , probably one of the best in the city .
i mean , they serve absinthe !
everything i 've had there was suuuuper delicious .
i have always enjoyed myself here .
i 've dined and drank and drank and drank .
_num_ ) their kitchen stays open all night .
'nuff said .
nothing at this restaurant warrants the cost .
the staff always act like you 're wasting their time .
go to escobar if you want expensive food worth the cost .
my first disappointment was in the size of the menu .
i also ordered a small side salad .
fusion or jim gould over this place any day !
awful place .
the potatoes and chorizo came in an extremely small portions and where bland .
this place takes small portions to a new level .
overall i left that place with $ _num_ less and still hungry .
not worth the money and the food was a complete disappointment .
the only reason this place is getting two stars is because of their drinks .
if you want good cocktails that are overpriced this is your place !
they were both fine .
very heavy on mixer .
the food is decent as well .
fried eggplant with balsamic vinegar and honey ... what ?
why ?
my friend loved it .
i tried it .
yuck !
waaaay too sweet .
lots of dishes with honey when i was there last .
i feel like that summarizes this restaurant adequately .
better places out there .
especially for mexican food .
came here for my birthday .
we ordered a couple glasses of pinot noir and were happy with their selection .
our appetizer , the broiled goat cheese , was amazing .
our scallops were perfectly cooked and seasoned .
the accompanying puree had pieces of bacon which perfectly complemented the entire dish .
i absolutely loved the mousse while my partner preferred the chocolate cake .
overall it was an amazing dinner .
go to radio maria and order their dinner specials .
you will not be disappointed .
falling fast .
pity to see an old favorite fall this far .
we went for a brunch , and the food was amazing !
my wife had the french toast and something eggy .
probably an omelet .
the french toast was fabulous .
the cuban was served on a fresh baguette .
the meat was terrific , and so was the bread .
very highly recommended !
i came here for tapas after reading the reviews on yelp .
radio maria did not disappoint !
first off , i loved the atmosphere .
the architecture and style of the place is so artistic and unique .
it 's beautiful .
i love the artwork all over the walls and the bar area especially .
the drinks are reasonably priced and tasty too .
everything i ordered was great , but the potatoes were amazing !
they were crispy and had a delicious flavor because they were hickory smoked .
i ca n't wait to come back to have them again !
two words .
grilled plaintains .
ho my god .
living on grad assistant paychecks , it 's a nice treat to come here .
anyway , _num_ stars .
take your date here .
he/she will thank you .
my husband and i recently ate at radio maria for dinner .
we 'd had sunday brunch and loved it at that time .
in all fairness , it started out wrong .
while he carried on an obvious flirtation/personal conversation with the other employee .
i would n't recommend it for dinnertime but may try again for brunch .
however , the kitchen was very clearly overextended on the graduation saturday .
as for the food , we started with the arancini and garlic shrimp skewers .
the arancini was satisfying though plain , and the shrimp skewers were well done .
as i mentioned , the entrees were good enough to warrant a return trip .
their sunday brunch is outstanding !
they also have a bloody mary bar , which is incredible .
perhaps , more important is their tapas dinner menu and their selection of beer .
their beer and wine selection is top-notch !
radio maria is a tried and true champaign restaurant .
it 's a must if you 're in the area .
i always bring visitors and guests here !
service was a little slow but great food and an interesting atmosphere .
i went with a friend and sat outside .
it was a beautiful night and our server was very personable and helpful .
we got three tapas and an entree and it was all great .
a bunch of people told us to try the plantains .
they were our least favorite .
they were n't bad ... just plain .
they were both excellent .
we had their gnocchi special which was absolutely delicious .
it was definitely worth the trip .
it is definitely a more casual place .
the servers were n't around every minute , but i really did n't mind .
it is pricier , but worth the money .
aghhhh this place is great !
!
last time i went there , i re-orgasmed over and over again .
you have to try their steak tips tapas dish .
hopefully it 's still there .
only downfall though ?
anyway ,
a grad school fav ...
on a friday afternoon , i was one of six sitting at the bar .
with the downtown champaign scene evolving , this kind of situation is unacceptable .
what a unique , wonderful place !
must have = eggplant frites .
their drink menu was extensive , but pricey .
the server was personable and ready to provide recommendations though .
i 'd definitely go back when i visit champaign .
huge wine list .
great service .
brunch menu is fantastic .
love the masa boat and the mexican cofee !
the brunch was very tasty and a good value .
the dinner , however , was nothing special .
the service was good .
i would suggest going here for brunch .
dinner is also good , but not amazing .
i had the brunch and enjoyed it thoroughly .
moral of the story : come here for brunch and not dinner .
i have tried radio maria on visits to cu .
lunch on one trip was nothing short of inedible .
dinner one night was nice but over priced .
the food seems uninspired and the quality of ingredients is average .
i do like the decor of the bar .
what happened to this place ?
i am giving this restaurant _num_ stars .
i do n't want anyone else wasting their money at this establishment .
here goes :
my fellow students and i had organized a fundraiser to be held at r.m .
the food we ordered which was on a nearby table , was also covered .
again ?
this has happened to other customers ?
the manager took no action in remedying the situation .
worse yet , the manager only refunded us the cost of one cheese plate .
thanks .
you 're swell .
i had the vegetarian masa boat on saturday , and it was absolutely delicious .
amazing flavors , really great crab .
waiter was very friendly also
forgot to mention the interior design of this place was very attractive and comfortable
first time at radio maria .
had brunch on a busy sunday .
our waitress was pleasant , attentive , and fast .
i had the smoked pork torta and it was fantastic .
would like to go back again .
unique place .
you wo n't find anything like it .
has a full resturant and a apas bar .
great food , and truly excellent service .
easily the most interesting place in central illinois .
really .
it 's definitely for `` friends '' after hours .
i remember i had the arancini ... .holy crap was it delicious ! !
!
the vibe was chill and trendy .
a bit upscale for my liking ... but eh , to each his/her own .
had brunch there on sunday with _num_ people .
_num_ vegetarian and _num_ very picky eater .
we loved it .
everything was spectacular .
only downfall - not enough of the potatoes which were incredible !
had the smoked trout omelette which was soooo good .
it did not .
the ambience at the bar is really exceptional .
the sea scallops and the seared tuna will make you crave more .
the bartender can accomodate any request , with a passion .
we have him making key lime pie martinis , and they rock .
fun place .
ultra cool .
super hip .
stunning !
astounding interior !
amazing bar !
look at the bar - the rail is a retired escalator handrail .
even the host station is a re-purposed tube radio .
gad - there was so much eye-candy , i had a blast !
the tapas is simply amazing - every dish we ordered was good .
they are reserved to the hilt usually .
all in all , a good meal .
we have eaten here twice , and love the place .
from the outside it was n't very impressive .
once inside , we took a seat a the bar .
the menu runs from an inventive tapas list to unique entrees .
my first visit to champaign and our host took us here .
went here for brunch with my sisters .
the atmosphere was great !
restaurant seems to run pretty smoothly ... service was decent as well .
love this place !
went there for a late dinner .
love the bar , love the atmosphere .
ate off the tapas menu ... .food was the best ! ! !
the scallops melted in your mouth !
wine was great ... service was great !
ca n't wait to go back !
we tried the cheese plate which was outstanding .
i could have just eaten that and been happy .
the marinade was so vinegary , not a smooth flavor at all .
i would not order that again .
the paella was really really good .
the rice part was outstanding and the chicken and seafood were generous and tender .
what a treat !
it was a great meal with the family but very expensive .
next game , those kids are getting pizza or burgers !
ol !
ultimately i decided on three stars because the service is decent .
the food is nothing to write home about .
our server was pleasant but seemed bored and/or distracted .
i do n't plan on going back any time soon .
there are several other places downtown that are much better ( i.e .
big grove and bacarro ) .
not a bad place but not great either .
great vegetarian options and large beer selection !
highly recommend !
came here one evening for tapas with friends .
i ordered the wild mushroom crostini , smoked pork tacos and sauteed calamari .
my favorite was the wild mushroom crostini .
the sauteed calamari was an interesting dish with a lot of flavor .
my wife and i returned to radio after not having been for several years .
the service was fantastic and the wine list was excellent .
the arancini were nicely done , if slightly overpowered by the breading .
similarly , the scallops were very well done , but were not diver scallops .
it totally overshadowed the crab .
the beignets were huge , which meant they were n't cooked through .
the best dish of the night was the tacos .
smoky , spicy , delicious .
we came here for sunday brunch , and ordered _num_ things .
leroy 's buttermilk skillet cornbread @ $ _num_ - just one slice .
taste-wise nothing to write home about , the bread is just so-so .
marmalade added a nice kick to it though .
the deep fried house potatoes were delish .
nice ambient , but can get very noisy .
our overall rating of the restaurant is 2-star .
we ordered a few tapas and an entree to share .
my friend decided to order them anyway .
i mostly go here for brunch and the food rarely disappoints .
the torta maria and smoked port torta are unusual and always good .
the omelettes are only ok ; somehow they seem a bit dry and overcooked .
my main complaint with brunch is the coffee .
for my last dinner experienced there , i had a tenderloin special .
i believe the sauce mentioned in the description was absent .
i guess we were expected to order cocktails and appetizers .
i feel like radio ca n't decide what it is .
a fancy drink bar ?
a tapas bar ?
a haute cuisine restaurant ?
it does all those things fairly well , but none of them exceptionally .
a very interesting spot in downtown champaign .
i am probably missing something ...
tables spread out up front .
a blue lit bar , and a spinning wheel of taps .
strange lighting , and can get very loud later at night .
artsy and hip without being completely pretentious .
just a little though .
service can be a bit slow , but always friendly and knowledgeable .
beer list is always rotating .
i think the wheel has about _num_ taps .
then a creative cocktail menu , which i have yet to try .
food is interesting .
a mix of tapas , other small plates , and brunch .
hanger steak is good , as is the duck .
like bone marrow , pork shoulder , and ricotta .
this is definitely a place to check out downtown .
an interesting mix of different bar and restaurant concepts .
good beer , interesting and often very good food .
good spot .
what can i say ?
i understand that graduation weekend in chambana can be really crazy .
however , the service we got was unacceptable .
fill our water glasses ) , etc .
the restaurant is also extremely noisy .
given the prices at the restaurant , we really expected better .
apparently , my 90+ year old grandparents did n't notice it either .
my grandpa also got meat that was not good quality .
it was very tough and he said it was inedible .
there are restaurants in chambana that have great food for better prices .
excellent !
great service - very knowledgable , friendly , funny , and efficient wait staff .
the food is always amazing and the drinks are delicious .
brunch is especially delectable .
seems like the only spanish restaurant in c-u area ?
foods are good .
but the price is a little bit high since it locates at downtown champaign .
my friend and i went here for brunch .
everything was delicious !
i got the caprese omelet , and my friend got the lobster omelet .
the beer bread and potatoes that come with the omelet were so good !
we also tried the mexican coffee .
it does n't taste that good with the food .
it tastes better on its own .
it 's something you wo n't regret trying .
it 's sweet and has a strong cinnamon flavor .
service was pretty slow , but we were okay with that this time .
i highly recommend going to radio maria for brunch !
i would love to try their lunch and dinner menu as well : )
great food .
excellent atmosphere .
great beer selection , nice outdoors sitting area .
definetely one of the best places downtown .
unlike that filthy cowboy monkey .
good draft beer selection .
the mushrooms were bland -- the broth needs to be more flavorful .
the potatoes were well seasoned and the dressing paired nicely .
the mussels were served in generous proportion .
overall , 50/50 good bad .
*hearts-in-eyes emoji goes here*
i absolutely love radio maria .
the atmosphere , decor , and food is downright enchanting .
if you want to wow your first date - do n't come here .
they will fall in love with this restaurant and probably forget all about you .
i ca n't get enough of this place .
i believe they got a new chef semi recently ...
brunch might be the best in champaign-urbana area .
5-stars .
beer-bread toast is thick and incredible .
omelets are over-stuffed and innovative and completely satisfying .
regular specials make some variation on the menu .
coffee is aromatic and high quality .
food was decent - the radio maria torta was the best thing we tried .
desserts here were quite tasty .
the service was incredibly slow .
it took at least an hour to get our food .
biggest complaint of the night , and makes me not inclined to return .
we did tapas , so here ' s rundown .
likes
fried artichoke hearts
arancini ( favorite ! )
charcuterie
so-so
grilled hanger steak
salmon
raw and roasted apple salad
the staff was friendly but not memorable .
some of the items i felt were well-priced ( $ 5-8 ) .
by far our favorite spot we 've eaten at so far in champaign .
very large beer selection as well .
highly recommend - we 'll be back !
!
the good :
-the goat cheese , the goat cheese , the goat cheese ! !
-the pork tacos were also delicious , and obviously slow cooked , very delicious .
the meh :
overall :
-would definitely return !
especially for date night , it 's a fantastic place .
great , unique food .
awesome atmosphere .
the hummus is fantastic , as is the goat cheese with honey .
brunch is awesome
delicious , loved the tapas and the paella .
very good food , a little pricey but worth it for a nice dinner out
food was good , not excellent .
prices seem high for the quantity and quality you get .
fun atmosphere and decor .
ordered an omelette , eggs benedict , and egg sandwich .
everything was fresh and delicious , large portions .
beer bread was excellent , as were the mango mimosas !
would absolutely go back
one of the best restaurants in town .
eggplant frites-yum !
great date spot .
they have two menus , one for traditional dinner and one with tapas items .
since i like trying different things , we decided to share _num_ small plates .
charcuterie plate : slightly untraditional plate of four types of meat .
spicy salami-ish meat , serrano ham , duck breast , and bbq crispy pork .
mussels : really complex flavorful broth with well cooked and meaty mussels .
the toast they came with was top notch , also .
lamb meatballs : tasty , especially with hidden gems of pine nuts .
if you really like meatballs , i definitely recommend these .
i loved these .
brunch was delicious !
i enjoyed the scrambler - all components were cooked perfectly .
loved the beer bread .
others in the party recommended the omelets as well .
generous portions , reasonably priced and fun atmosphere .
order the coffee rubbed filet - you will not be disappointed .
_num_ of our _num_ diners ordered it - all had spotless plates .
definitely a fan of radio maria .
it 's always a safe bet for a great meal .
i always have tapas but they have a full dinner menu as well .
i recommend the hanger steak , plantains , and pork tacos .
the wine and beer selections are also substantially larger than the average restaurant .
best bartenders in town !
otherwise ?
matt ! ! !
can you please train the rest of the staff on how to be wonderful ?
we really enjoy this place .
service is great .
we usually sit at the bar so we see all the servers .
all are very nice and friendly .
things appear to move quickly and efficiently from the kitchen
radio maria has the best cubans in champaign .
the tapas , however , are pretty good .
i ca n't speak for the bar and restaurant itself .
as a party venue , radio maria was really great .
i love the old architecture and the period decorations .
when you walk in , the bar is is front of you .
it is large , and i would guess that it is very well attended .
their infused liquors are all made on premises .
the dining room is large .
we had a limited menu with four choices and we all pre-ordered our meals .
i ca n't say as much for the meal - i had smoked ribs .
they were pretty tough , but did have a good taste .
they also have tables on the sidewalk which we took advantage of .
addicting brunch .
many veggie options
first time here ... and i 've heard great things about this place .
we started off ordering a tapas as our appetizer ... the apple salad .
it was very disappointing .
the bacon was not reheated ... i mean who likes cold bacon ?
for pur entrees we ordered the scallops and duck meatloaf .
the duck was unknowingly served with the same exact jam .
we went there a few times .
the service was fine , the atmosphere was okay .
the food was awful .
everything contained way too much garlic .
you could smell and taste the garlic in everything .
went for sunday brunch .
shared some scones , got the `` special '' omelette with chorizo and vegetables .
two stars for the service .
pros :
-the scones rocked .
-the house potatoes were perfect -- crispy and flavorful .
cons :
so much sadness ( and hunger ) .
-my omelette was far too salty .
visited this restaurant for the first time with my girlfriend due to friend recommendation .
and i have to say , it does live up to the hype .
their coffee was not their highlight .
they offered two specials that day : an omelette and a stuffed chili pepper .
we listened to our friendly waiter 's recommendation and ordered one of each .
their baked potatoes that accompanied the core of the meals were phenomenal !
definitely keep a lookout on the specials if you want something more memorable .
definitely would return to this place next time i am in town .
made the mistake of coming here for brunch homecoming weekend .
the service was incredibly slow .
took over an hour to get two breakfast dishes .
after the wait i was expecting greatness but this restaurant did not deliver .
eggs were over salted and the presentation was not appealing .
do n't think i 'll be back again .
food was creative but a bit off the mark : 4/5 .
service was super slow and less than stellar : 2/5
time easily killed by a walk around downtown .
a nice touch , i thought .
so cue another wait ...
food :
rated from best to worst :
what did not work : the goat cheese .
the slice of tomato/avocado combination did n't do anything for me .
beer bread ( 2/5 ) : really dry and cakey
overall ... meh .
the food has always been top-notch .
i go there regularly for tapas and on the weekends for brunch .
the service and staff are all very friendly and accommodating .
the environment there is also quite enjoyable ; albeit a bit hispter-ish .
but i would n't let that deter you .
overall , i do n't think you 'll be disappointed here .
solid 4/5
they have an array of holiday drinks that were n't bad .
pricey for being on a college student budget but delicious nonetheless
it was stiff and hard to chew .
we ended up canceling the order .
this is unbelievable .
this place is pretty awesome in downtown champaign .
goodness me !
that 's some good stuff to put on your fork !
only had a couple tapas here one time , but they were good .
brunch was awesome though .
small menu but so delicious .
in summer you can sit outside and it is something i will definitely repeat .
love their sides ! ! !
corn bread..cinnamon cake..fried banana ... french toast ! ! !
we almost ordered all the sides ! ! ! !
i love the cream cheese on the cinnamon cake ! !
god ! !
! it was fabulous ! ! ! !
! especially love the cheese inside the omelette ! ! !
it tasted so good that i finished it all ! ! !
and the waitress is friendly !
!
this is our favorite brunch spot .
the flaming frida is delicious .
do n't waste your time on the bloody mary bar .
thats my main complaint , the bloody marys do n't have enough garnishes .
you 're lucky to get an olive .
i 've been here for both brunch and dinner .
dinner was mediocre at best , but i enjoy their brunch .
it is likely the best brunch in champaign-urbana .
the french toast is a huge serving and delicious .
the omelettes are nice as well .
had group of _num_ and all had terrific meals .
good mix of fixed menu , tapas and entrees represented ... all were excellent .
cheese balls with mushroom , goat cheese .
this place was out of this world with the creativeness of the appetizers .
i 'd definitely go back there and continue to explore their menu .
radio maria is good .
not great , but good .
the menus are a bit unwieldy .
who puts feta on a cheese plate ?
very pricey , but a great night out .
we visited on a monday at around 5:30 .
the place was nearly empty , which was quite pleasant .
we were not disappointed ; the selection was quite nice .
we got the arancini and the torta maria .
the result was a bit too sweet for a dinner entree .
for dessert we got the bread pudding .
it was a solid if unexciting example of the form .
this is our go-to date night dinner out .
i have never had a problem getting a gluten free meal here .
i 'd give it a _num_ star rating if i could !
always just the perfect amount and gluten free !
one complaint is that the menu is rarely updated .
i had a great experience .
the food and drinks were great .
the ambience was great .
the waitress was very attentive to the party .
very eclectic and interesting food and drink choices .
especially the tapas .
tapas bar !
sat at the bar with a friend and the bar tender was awesome !
the ambiance was great because it was dark with cool lighting .
it was open late which worked because it 's a quiet town .
highly recommend this place !
radio maria really is a bright spot in downtown champaign .
the dinner menu is small but far more evenly excellent .
their desserts are also wonderful .
other restaurants in the area with comparable pricing ca n't deliver meals this nice .
and finally , go to radio maria for brunch .
radio maria is typically open at _num_ on sunday 's .
therefore leaving a bunch of reservations at a complete loss .
they clearly need to get their management/ organization in check .
will definitely not be recommending this establishment to anyone .
learn more about what hospitality and professionalism is .
soooooo , i love radio maria .
i have loved it for years .
i have seriously been frequenting this place for over a decade .
sunday brunch is tradition for me and a handful of my girlfriends .
we literally do it in some form every weekend .
today we went and well ... where should i start ?
our waiter was completely aloof .
it 's always 5pm on sunday funday ) .
no biggie though .
my steak and poached eggs were not hot when delivered to my table .
no biggie though .
( look at the picture ! )
in what restaurant world is this ok ?
$ _num_ for _num_ shrimp ?
but _num_ shrimp ?
do n't be petty .
the food seems extremely simple for their prices .
this is probably my go-to restaurant in champaign .
not the case at radio .
they have a diverse menu , and pretty much everything is very good .
) .
the place itself is very cool .
i like downtown champaign , and this is one of the nicer spaces .
the bar is truly outstanding .
probably 25+ beers on tap , and good nightly drink specials .
the food always pleases .
it 's a very versatile place that can appeal to a variety of tastes .
friendly , quick .
we were in before dinner norm hours .
small portion on garlic shrimp , pork tacos stale shell .
salsa was tasty , pork bland .
nice looking place .
i had a boss who was obsessed with this place .
they have good hummus and i like the fried plantains .
otherwise , it 's fine .
brunch is the best time to go .
best unique and fancy restaurant i 've been to in downtown champaign .
service was excellent .
ex .
fancy plating .
you 're probably going to spend average $ 25+ per entree .
overall , i 'd go there again to try their brunch .
love this place !
amazing food , i would recommend the pesto omelette ! !
love the selection and proves are reasonable .
their paella is amazing .
lord ... .those big , beautiful scallops .
also had the on their brunch menu .
the eggs benedict with mahi mahi .
the former , beautifully prepared .
but everything else on that plate , including the cornbread slice were lovely .
i really need to try their tapas and meats .
got the vegetarian paella and fried chickpeas .
neither were as flavorful as i would have expected .
the chickpeas were dry and bland and i normally love chickpeas !
would get the paella again , not the chickpeas .
there are so many good things to say about radio maria .
their style is a marriage between old world _num_ 's and the 21st century .
the tables are decorated underneath and they are unique to every table .
there are about _num_ tables outside if you like sitting outdoors .
they have a wide selection of omelets .
they also have egg dishes with rice and beans .
it includes vegetarian options .
i had the guava juice , churros , and smoked pork posole .
it hit the spot .
try getting a slice of beer bread !
it 's hearty and is flavorful .
the churros are fluffy and not too sweet .
i am not familiar with real churros , but this one tasted good !
the service for a sunday brunch is slow .
the tapas menu is extensive .
hands down , my favorite dish to order are the lamb meatballs .
you have to try them !
i also love the paella .
it is big , so plan on sharing or gorging yourself in awesomeness .
their brunch menu has options that can appeal to everyone from vegetarians to children .
the goat cheese in the dish was delicious !
unfortunately , the service was still very slow after we were seated .
no one came to take our order until we flagged down a waiter ourselves .
overall , i 'd say radio maria has a lovely atmosphere and great food .
really great food and some great options if you 're a vegetarian .
food and atmosphere was excellent .
cool place in downtown
hostess was delightful and i look forward to having her as a waitress soon .
food was good but chorizo lacked flavor and heat in my special omelette .
bloody mary served in a wine glass ?
really ?
not my first time here and not a best either .
what a gem !
this is our new fav spot when we come to town .
thanks to all for wonderful food and service !
came in on a sunday with my brother and his wife and young son .
restaurant was very frendly and understanding of nephew wanting to walk around .
however , after being seated , the wait for service was pretty bad .
i did n't feel like messing with that and elected against it .
sadly , i had to remind the waiter _num_ minutes later about my drink .
eventually that food came out .
the food was good .
the migas were crispy because of the cooked in tortilla strips .
it was a good amount of food and very tasty .
let me start this off by saying i 'm a very cheap eater .
first off , the restaurant has a great atmosphere .
all the waiters/waitresses and hosts were extremely friendly and conversational .
but really though , how 's the food ?
well , it 's also great .
they have 1/2 off wine bottles !
p.s .
if/when i verify this i 'll make sure to update my review .
this place is a local favorite and definitely somewhere to visit .
my first visit to radio maria and i love it .
kelly , our server , was quick , patient and polite .
i had the lobster omelette and my daughter had the lobster eggs benedict .
thanks radio maria , we will be back .
came here for tapas with my mom and brother on a sunday night .
we ordered _num_ tapas to split between us .
the service was slow and a bit ... ditsy ...
our artisanal cheeses were served with tiny hard pieces of pita bread , weird .
back to the cold pita that was served ...
when she brought the pita back , it had been deep fried.. what ?
still not sure why this was n't served in the first place ...
in summary :
service : terrible
food : pretty good , despite the fee makes that chef made
atmosphere : very nice !
you can choose to sit in a casual area or a dining room
prices : pretty expensive for the amount of food you 're getting
i feel blessed whenever i eat here .
the vibe is cool , and the food is great .
all of it .
would repeat .
had brunch here and was recommended lobster eggs benedict .
i also tried their caprese omelet and it was too garlicky .
i would n't go there for their brunch .
i came here for brunch on a sunday morning .
the wait was n't too bad for two people close to noon .
by the way , the beer bread is fantastic !
such a fun place to have tapas .
the paella is a must .
glad to know doug and steph are still there .
they make great drinks and are great for business .
food is good i like the changing menu .
ca n't go wrong with the fried goat cheese !
best brunch in town .
get a reservation , though !
they also have great wine specials and the tapas is worth the price .
radio is definitely one of my favorite regular places .
the tapas are great , though generally quite small for what you pay .
the wine selection is excellent , too .
the tapas menu is really good ... and the ambience is really good .
decor- great
nice atmosphere large bar with lots of choices
end point : really really disappointing bloody mary
had dinner here a few times .
first , it uses beef , which makes it a cottage pie .
again with the trying too hard ... .
i wish i had gotten more of those ...
i 've also come for brunch , where they have various omelettes .
excellent food , decent service .
portions are great and very filling .
i 've been on the toilet since i got home and i feel great .
great atmosphere too !
would definitely recommend this place .
champaign has changed since i went to school here many moons ago .
it has changed for the much better .
i love the selection of restaurants and shops , and especially this place .
i felt like i was back home in chicago and not a college town .
this restaurant was just add good as the better places at home .
the dishes were original and delicious with fresh ingredients and flavor .
this will be a restaurant i will visit next time i 'm here .
i went for brunch and got the migas dish .
it was very flavorful .
i really liked the table and overall interior decorations- very old-timey and vintage .
i would definitely come again !
i like to snapshot my reviews so here is what you need to know :
pros :
food was yummy .
food has a different spin on classic dishes
mixed :
wait staff seemed on edge .
i did n't know sunday was brunch only menu
bad :
service was untimely
a gem in champaign !
if you love spanish cuisine then give this place a try !
my favorite restaurant to date !
just an idea .
just got up and walked out on mother 's day .
thanks radio .
reservation does n't mean you are getting a seat !
does she not know what the word reservation mean ? ? ?
the point of making a reservation is getting a table at the reserved time !
i 'm from here , but have lived in la for _num_ years .
radio maria is better than most la restaurants !
!
the food was amazing we had pork tacos ! !
so delish !
there was a guy in the corner which started putting on some enticing music !
our bartender was on top of it ! !
i just ca n't recommend this place more highly ! !
check it out !
!
i 've eaten here on average of around eight times a year since _num_ .
i 've always had really good servers and bartenders here .
some of the menu dishes are downright bad by any standard .
a vanilla cream sauce does n't complement goat cheese , for example .
it is n't interesting .
it 's just kind of awful .
the worse store ever in costumer service !
crystal is the worse !
the restaurant itself is small place , with a bad lighting .
looks like an old and unloved place by its owner .
the owner usually has an attitude towards the customers !
now the food itself .
it is usually pretty empty , lunch or dinner time .
so , i have no clue how this place survives .
the falafel ended up a little dry and the little leave wraps were sour .
maybe i should try the shwarma instead .
this is my new favorite restaurant in chambana !
the falafal is very fresh and moist .
not your typical dried out american falafal .
the yogurt salad is homemade and the perfect side for any of their sandwiches .
also , the samosas are lightly fried and delicately delicious .
this place is also incredibly cheap .
the actual physical space is modestly decorated with middle eastern art and photos .
it 's sort of subtly charming .
i know middle eastern food well , and have eaten falafel in many cities .
the falafel sandwich is one of the best i 've ever had .
the yogurt salad ( yogurt with cucumber , mint , parsley , etc . )
is delicious , and the lamb kebab sandwich is also fantastic .
the prices are amazing .
it 's a must try .
so why did i give it so many stars ?
below , i 've documented some of my observations while eating there .
read on :
( we learned later that you can just request a specific meat . )
( not even in sequential order !
) .
* this is the second example involving weird numbers .
... huh ?
great economic/environmental tactic ... ?
great food , great place to get together with friends , great prices !
do n't be intimidated by the owner ...
give the place a shot ... you wo n't regret it !
i personally love the falafal !
the food was actually pretty good and i , at least , left satisfied .
highlights :
-fairly cheap
-probably not as bad as you think
the quality of the food is inconsistent .
the guy who works there seems very stressed and angry .
he does n't ever smile .
the prices are good and when the food is good , it is decent .
of all restaurants in chambana , this is by far my favorite .
the food is homemade-like , which was always a big plus for me .
it is a big tray with an assortment of tasty items .
i can more simply define jerusalem as : tasty , tasty , tasty .
totally love it .
ah , yes , the owner .
some people complain about him .
wonderful hummus and everything else , too !
the arabian tea is also delish !
the food is quite good and reasonable .
i love giving him the business and i love the taste of his food !
i give it _num_ stars because service can be hit or miss .
pros : shawarma sandwich was decent .
kefta kabob meat was not bad ( ordered kefta kabob plate ) .
cons : ambiance .
rest of food being mediocre .
the hummus is to die for .
so creamy !
we usually get the dish of the day .
my personal favorite is the fish .
it 's cheap , but definitely not cheaply prepared !
great food and good specials !
the spiced tea ( hot or cold ) is delicious , too .
just awesome ... . vegetarian plate is great , cheap and healthy
inexpensive , solid falafel and fries .
good mint tea .
my favorite place to eat in urbana-champaign .
( - ) sometimes slow ;
the best deal is probably the plate of the day .
when i come alone , i usually get something smaller .
most often :
_num_ falafel sandwich ( $ _num_ ) delicious ! !
!
_num_ rice and veggies ( small for $ _num_ )
_num_ lentil soup ( small for $ _num_ )
dolmeh ( stuffed grape leaves ) is great too , but rather expensive .
i tried the chicken shawrma sandwich .
it was good !
but wait time is too long !
: (
restaurant review
do you remember that episode in seinfeld at the soup restaurant .
not the best customer service , but i digress .
the upside is the food is inexpensive compared to chicago .
there are daily specials .
the flavors were very authentic , not too salty or spicy .
i just wish the lamb was not cooked way through .
all said and done , i will be back if i crave mediterranean food .
pro : inexpensive , authentic middle eastern food
i 'm surprised by some of the positive reviews this place has received .
just not worth going !
very good food !
i always get the steak shawarma !
this is my favorite place in c-u for a quick , cheap lunch .
the guy at the counter is pretty stony-faced , but he 's always polite .
i wonder if there 's some kind of secret pattern to them ...
not sure i 'd evem give them _num_ star..false advertising .
menu on yelp states lentil soup is made with olive oil .
there will be no soup for me here !
i 'm not sure .
i would n't get it again .
it was not bland and definitely the highlight of my meal .
overall , i was disappointed having spent almost $ .
this place was way worse than what i expected .
he does n't talk or even smile .
no silverware or glassware whatsoever ; everything was disposable .
we ended up paying $ _num_ for _num_ people without any drinks .
i 'm never coming back to this place .
honestly , my expectations could n't have been faltered this much .
my first and last time .
overpriced for a small portion and bland .
love the tea here .
iced tea is just as good .
the food is simple , a little plain but good .
lentil soup is also tasty and filling .
the falafel does leave something to be desired .
i also do n't mind the guy behind the counter .
this guy smiles at you its genuine .
my mistake .
this restaurant serves very healthy food .
love the plate of the day .
best option for vegetarians in champaign-urbana .
alright , the owner really tries .
the tea here is excellent and the falafel has improved greatly .
food is very fresh here !
i am a big fan of jerusalem these days .
i can see the one and only guy cooking , taking orders and cleaning .
freshness of food and the guy 's dedication to serve quality food impressed me .
it 's up to you , folks ! ! ...
whatever makes you happy .
the food was incredibly good , i highly recommend the chicken kabob sandwhich .
going to come here more often , and the prices are great too .
great food for a great price !
chicken is cooked to a perfection !
daily specials get you full with less than $ _num_ .
it shows in the restaurant , which is well decorated and spotlessly clean .
you decide whether that 's a good price .
he made my food to-order , so it took about _num_ mins .
its a standard shawarma and theres nothing to complain about .
veggies are fresh ; meat could use a bit more flavor , is all .
so it depends on what you 're feeling .
jerusalem was my favorite place to eat the _num_ years i was there .
the fish is excellent with the lunch special .
today brought me to jerusalem middle eastern cuisine .
i waited about _num_ minutes and done , done ; my food was ready .
the beef was very tasty and i loved the sauce .
overall i will return to try something different .
still very flavorful and delicious .
my criteria for finding a hotel was rather short : cheap .
red roof fit the bill nicely .
the room was spacious , and surprisingly quiet .
i love a hotel where the cashier sits behind bulletproof glass .
nothing makes me feel safer .
`` do all the non-smoking rooms have ash trays in them ? ''
first and last time i stay at a red roof .
blah .
that made for a pleasant morning of tailgating in late october .
are .
you .
kidding .
so ... .good customer service after the fact ... not so great hotel stay .
never again .
the smell was so bad that it seeped into our clothing .
there was also a cigarette burn in my blanket .
the manager just charged me for one day , but it was horrible !
rundown rattrap .
low price was the main attraction .
place was noisy , and needs complete renovation .
manager was sarcastic , toward any complaints .
have stayed at other red roofs ; nothing like this one .
moved to la quinta next morning .
lol
no hair dryer or iron .
if your bougie ... ..pass this up and spend more money elsewhere .
roadtrip from mn to cincinnati and this was our overnight .
it was clean although the room had a musty/stale smell and damp carpet .
it served it 's purporse for a place to crash .
the staff feeds the squirrels and they 're friendly .
construction is going on and lots of storage containers in the parking lots .
) .
there was no refrigerator , microwave , or breakfast .
they did have coffee in the lobby and some nice hazelnut creamer .
do n't even bother .
the rate may be cheap but it 's still too much .
musty damp smell in the entire room .
there was even a bug smashed and stuck on the wall .
i ca n't believe housekeeping would even consider this clean .
_num_ stars for being gross .
like sketchy gross .
blegh .
not worth the value .
+ _num_ star for being near a taco bell and tgifridays
the hotel is not bad at all .
kids _num_ and under stay free , pets also .
by i74 and near several places to eat .
we requested one of the newly renovated room and bottom floor .
this is applicable for all red roof inns .
the location is right off the freeway and the room was clean and perfect .
the staff was real friendly .
overall , the hotel was great for my needs .
pros :
- tv has hdmi can connect to ipad , chromecast , etc .
- clean interior ( recently new renovated room )
- clean bedding
- great wi-fi
- friendly staff
cons :
- noise from freeway
super nice staff and clean basic renovated rooms .
plus you ca n't beat the price .
we were traveling with a small trailer and were concerned about safe parking .
thanks red roof for a good night 's sleep and piece of mind .
my wife and i stayed here after booking it on expedia .
we got the room for a discounted price and expected cheap quality .
the room looked amazing !
they removed their carpet and placed laminated floors so the floor was very clean .
i like to walk barefoot so i could tell that the floor was clean .
the bed by far though was the best part .
it was a king size with soft and clean feeling sheets .
the mattress was very comfortable and the a/c worked like a dream .
i would definitely stay here again .
a great price for a clean room and comfy bed .
the place was affordable and the staff was really nice .
the laminate floors in the rooms were a brilliant idea .
the place is pet friendly which is another plus for a lot of people .
i would definitely stay here again .
room was clean .
nothing fancy .
staff was friendly and let us check in several hours early .
close to many eateries and the mall and interstate .
no problems , would stay again .
front desk staff is friendly but otherwise this place is a complete bust .
she mumbled us a warning about the pentagon and planes flying over the motel .
great room , recently renovated nicely , new `` hardwood '' floor -- clean !
this hits the hotel trifecta : cheap , spacious and clean .
cheap : a king suite clocks in at about $ _num_ / night .
but it is , as advertised , very comfortable .
dirty room , rude staff , overpriced .
stay away .
sleep in the park ; it 's cleaner .
my kids call it `` low-quality inn '' .
that 's coming from a _num_ yr old , and we all agreed .
also , garbage was overflowing in the breakfast area .
back to the room .
.
.
tv was old - not a flat screen .
room was hot .
is that enough comments ?
the hotel is filthy and not taken care of .
the staff and management is even worse .
the people that run this hotel are incredibly unprofessional .
do not stay here !
worst decision you could make !
and do n't forget rude staff , that was the cherry on top ! !
sleep in your car , you 'll have a better experience .
overall not bad for price paid .
maybe a little carpet fresh for the hallways ?
both beds were super comfy and had lots of pillows and towels .
i slept really great both nights .
nice and quiet stay , except for that shower drip .
besides a little air freshening , it would be worth the $ 69/night .
great stay , staff was extremely friendly and helpful .
breakfast had a large selection and was very good .
my mom and i stayed here for _num_ nights .
if i could rate this as a negative _num_ star i would .
the towels were grungy and the toilet barely flushed .
we even had bare wires above our bed as no fixture had been installed .
the reviews on their website did not adequately represent this shit hole !
i will be trying to file a complaint .
we are writing a travel book .
we stayed only one night here .
we would not visit here again .
i checked in , walked down to my room , and let myself in .
this was an improvement .
no one living there .
on the other hand , it had n't been cleaned from the last occupant .
bed unmade , towels and trash on the floors , etc .
back to the front desk .
apologetic clerk .
he comes back and gives it a clean bill of health .
i go down , and yes , it 's better looking .
until i look in the bathroom .
there 's no toilet seat !
it 's broken off and thrown under the sink .
back to the front desk .
`` listen , i 'm usually not a complainer ... '' more apologies .
an even bigger discount on a room .
off he goes to check another room .
he comes back .
this room is fine , he says .
it 's clean , has a toilet seat .
i go down to the room , and it passes my quick inspection .
twenty minutes later , i realize the room is no warmer .
i check the heating unit and it 's blowing cold air .
that 's it , i 'm done !
this place is a hell hole .
do n't stay here !
one star only because zero stars is not an option .
jack lawson
this hotel is dirty and smells bad .
the elevator was broken , and the tub and toilet were plugged .
management is friendly but everything needs cleaned .
the pool , the hallways , the bathrooms .
everything .
did n't dare even try the free breakfast .
pay a few more dollars and stay somewhere else .
do n't use this company .
also technician accidentally dropped a bunch of chemicals in our yard in a pile .
a lot of chemicals in one pile results in dead grass .
never ever use this company .
totally agree with the previous review .
simply , they try to charge for applications they never have done .
worse , communication with this company is a nightmare .
i think that there is something wrong with the company ( seriously ) .
someone at the company is making the application record up or cooking the book .
these people seem to be off their meds ! ! !
i called and they claimed i had signed up for their total program .
save your money .
these people are a joke ! !
!
what a fantastic company !
so easy to work with their friendly and professional staff !
for a 'non-smoking ' hotel this place sure reeks of cigarettes and joints .
apparently the management does not think highly of the state 's smoking ban .
i guess they took care of that problem .
_num_ stars !
what 's the point ? )
i appreciated the warm cookies , friendly staff , and comfortable bed .
i would definitely stay here again .
had a romantic experience here in the hottub suite with my husband .
nice walk in shower .
huge bed and two flat screen tv too .
great customer service
no , this is not health food .
) .
alexander 's was the place to go when you want to celebrate anything .
the grill is also used for garlic butter texas toast as well as potato-grilling .
i would recommend this place .
the point of going to alexanders is to cook your own food .
if you just want a steak then go somewhere else .
that said , the experience that they create at this restaurant is wonderful .
for $ _num_ .
tasty beef you cook yourself at a large open vented indoor grill .
chef will grill your steak for your for an additional charge of $ _num_ .
former site of the round barn restaurant .
overall good dependable and tasty .
not fancy .
wear comfortable shoes if you plan to cook .
selection a bit limited and noisy when busy .
awesome !
this is the place to go for your steak fix on a student budget .
ive always enjoyed coming here .
now , for the not so great part ... dum dum duummmmmm ! ! !
! ... .
i mean , seriously ? ?
i have to cook it ? ?
?
so yeah .
its always been decent..
but if it wasnt , i would only have myself to complain to ...
i mean , i cooked the damn thing !
i guess .
great concept - pick your own , cook your own steak .
unlimited salad bar , baked potatoes , bread .
steaks are huge ... ...
wait , restaurant ... cook my own food ? ? ?
?
the prices are absolutely ridiculous .
the salad bar was very poor .
very limited selection , and the food looked old and wilted .
still , our waitress was never around .
it was mostly bar goers and people sitting around for drinks .
not a good sign for the quality of food to say the least .
all and all , i wo n't be going back here .
food was n't bad , but it was very under-portioned and ridiculously over priced .
i ca n't get into the `` cook my own steak '' deal either .
little dated , little dirty and fun .
great place for a guys night out .
i would call it a man cave .
my wife would not like it !
but i did .
my family goes here for special occasions .
i love the food .
you get to pick out your own steak which is pretty cool .
so you will have plenty of food .
never had a problem with parking .
service has always been pretty good .
good for groups .
that being said , their steak is well above average and fairly priced .
the service is always very friendly and they make themselves available .
by far my favorite steakhouse in the champaign-urbana area and recommend it to all .
excellent service , excellent food , love the socializing at the grill .
the salad bar is good but not great .
overall , this place is good .
there are so many varieties of meat to choose from .
i especially like the cook your own steak .
not a bad idea .
for starters , the steak 's quality here is just okay .
it 's not the greatest , but i 've had worse .
their steak challenge is pretty interesting though .
the rewards of this challenge has changed from time to time ( i.e .
i 've tried this before .
overall , alexander 's is a good break from the national chain steak restaurants .
you 'll pay a little more than you want for some decent steak .
this has got to be one of the most overrated eateries in the area .
cheap meat , crap salad bar , just awful .
go to a buffet and you will get better .
very sad .
we were sadly very disappointed .
i ordered my steak medium rare and got it well done .
the steak itself was nothing special and for a fillet it was pretty fatty .
i will never be coming back and will recommend friends to never go there .
dumb idea .
maybe if no upcharge kind of cool but come on .
three times i have eaten here never been dying to go back .
decent decor and texas toast is good .
take a grillmaster with you .
instead of back to the future , more like forward to the past .
and a good trip it is .
the beef is aged and of good quality .
there are also chicken and seafood meals .
while i cooked my steak i enjoyed the salad bar .
fries were thin in one direction and broad in another .
its sad there are n't many places like this anymore .
its great that there is alexander 's .
they charge you extra for their chef to cook it .
very much a steak and potato place .
we had a mixture of filets , ribeyes and sirloins .
the cuts were really good , not outstanding .
beets , bacon and eggs at the salad bar was a huge plus .
skillet cookie was top notch .
the manhattan was terrible .
quality establishment .
went here for dinner .
the place is outdated and dirty .
we even had to ask for our check !
the food was awful .
the steaks had no flavor and were chewy .
we had ours cooked .
i would not recommend .
i can make a better steak at home for half the price .
waste of time .
there were _num_ in our party .
we did n't stay .
it was an ok experience .
was it the best food i have ever had ?
no .
the building is quite old and it seemed very dark in there .
the floor was sticky and the table also was sticky .
i guess i am not in a huge hurry to go back .
the disappointing aspect was that the steaks were so bland .
the baked potato was actually really good yet the salad bar was nothing special .
the place seemed okay but was dirty and the lighting was terrible imho .
our waitress was nice and friendly and the service was good from that aspect .
probably would n't go back .
we had reservations and were seated quickly .
we waited another hour for our food .
7:15 arrival , nearly _num_ when we got our food .
service , worse every visit .
i dont plan on ever returning there again
these people giving bad reviews are missing the point .
this restaurant has been here for 30+ years .
the whole concept behind it is cooking your own steak !
do n't listen to the haters .
this place has a patina to it .
enjoy it in this world of chain restaurants .
eddie has been there longer than some customers are old .
if you like an old school steakhouse , this is a must .
this is on my top _num_ for casual dining .
food was good .
i should have asked the barkeep for some bourbon but lesson learned .
the steak was really tasty regardless the spices or lack there of .
the porter went really well with the skillet cookie we got for desert .
little more pricey then i thought at first .
but would come back .
additionally , the topping options got the baked potato was lacking .
do n't plan on visiting again .
second times for me in this place .
went back again on tuesday evening .
when my food came to table .
steak was under cook .
wait for _num_ minutes .
she never show up .
okay chef bring steak back to me .
and never see my sever again .
and all the time happen the manager stand _num_ feet away from us .
never said any word .
ask me steak good or not .
my t born steak have not any favor at all .
and my friend steak all a lot of fat .
think about .
if you a 'll what to spend _num_ usd for one steak .
and pay extra for them to cook .
your food should be perfect and good service .
but this is night mare for me
i give _num_ star cuz chef bring steak back to me .
if not , i wo n't give any thing .
and absolutely i wo n't come back to this place again .
love this place .
juicy rubeye ! !
!
just driving through the area and had to stop for the night .
the decor made me think it would be much more affordable than it was .
i mean , vinyl tablecloths at a steakhouse ?
no steak for me .
i ordered the shrimp , which came in a huge portion .
i ate 1/2 of the serving and left the rest .
they were gummy and flavorless .
the salad bar was unremarkable , but not bad .
so this is basically my husbands favorite place in champaign .
we have been there _num_ times now and it 's always good .
all the meat is great !
it 's a mans restaurant for sure !
giant chunks of meat , abnormally large potatoes and texas toast .
there is a great salad bar too .
i really love how clean it is here !
never once have i had a complaint .
no hairs in my food , no dirty floors or silverware .
they seem to have it together .
i do n't like how closed in it is around the grills .
you can hardly move .
let alone drink your expensive wine ...
my server has always been nice and helpful .
but do n't go here and plan to eat quick .
this place takes time .
anyways ... its meat you want ... that 's what you 'll get here !
nice atmosphere .
i thought the steaks are overpriced .
i enjoyed cooking my own steak .
you have to pay $ _num_ for them to cook your steak .
aged beef great sales bar .
a little $ $ $ but it was frantic cut of meet ..
get a long island ice tea .
they are amazing .
solid steakhouse .
friendly servers and easy access off the interstate .
we found this place via yelp and were very pleased .
highly recommend .
eating at the bar , the staff is friendly .
yum free popcorn .
the salad bar is so so needs to be cleaned now and then .
the ribeye i had needed some seasoning cooked to order med but somewhat bland .
we were hoping for better , do n't think i will be back
this is a really nice experience .
you get to cook your own food .
the place is amazing .
this place is always amazing .
i do not care what other people think .
if not then i have eddie prepare it for me .
this is a hangout spot , made to have a good time .
but well worth it ! ! ! ! ! ! !
!
my mom and grandmother both about fell while in there .
this place needs some money put into it but the owners refuse i guess .
its not like they dont make money with what they charge .
also its in a weird location .
other than the two negatives i had a great experience !
i made a reservation for 6pm .
in my mind a reservation at _num_ means you get seated around _num_ .
that is totally fair and understandable .
why not seat people at those tables ?
we all could 've been eating and done by now .
it was just super chaotic and unprofessional .
ummm , what ? !
no .
no you did n't .
i was so livid .
we should 've just gone there to begin with .
i had not been here for several years .
i wo n't be going back anytime soon .
way too expensive for what you get .
my meal was $ _num_ for a fillet they cook .
the meat was fine the salad bar was empty there had been _num_ buses .
the place was filthy .
the staff was beyond keeping up .
$ _num_ for half a glass of wine .
my bread was burnt my broccoli was cold and like eating a bush .
it took an hour to get our meal .
the waitress was absent .
the popcorn was burnt ... yikes ! !
!
had new carpet and wood floors put in my house .
the sales rep was very helpful .
same with the carpet .
how many businesses steer people to less expensive when they can ?
no pressure to commit .
i appreciated that .
when i did commit , she scheduled the installation promptly .
the installers were professional and personable .
the work was completed as promised and the results are very nice .
the carpet is so comfortable to sit on the floor .
she was always available throughout the entire process and afterwards .
very knowledgable and personable .
i would not hesitate to recommend this business to anyone looking into new flooring .
their salesperson is too pushy and followed up around .
carpet is too expensive compared to other places .
great prices ! !
love it !
store review :
this is like a combination of marshall 's with kohls .
pros : some good yellow ticket sales , variety of goods
cons : no name brand clothes
hidden deals :
check your receipt for a _num_ % off coupon after survey on one item
i still shop here when i come to town to visit family .
great labor day sales .
_num_ % off all clearances made amazing deals !
my husband found so many things as well as my sister .
love the store !
they could so without a few rude employees .
but still i 'll give this store _num_ stars
i will come here for discounted perfume .
some fun lingerie and guy clothes .
they have some fun home decor too .
yah , i know .
it 's just a gas station/convenience store .
not something to yelp about .
except that it is .
they do .
here ?
it was .
road trips mean public bathrooms , which few folks think of as enjoyable .
even the lighting was just nice .
i ca n't explain .
but this is what made me have to yelp it .
the store was very clean and well stocked .
clean bathrooms !
huge selection of great snacks and healthy ones too !
nothing great , nothing bad .
need gas , it will suit your needs .
oh and they have cold bottles of water .
the road ranger is literally two minutes off i-57 .
ladies room is clean and functional , but not posh .
but it is free .
you ca n't go back in time and kill hitler .
you ca n't stop the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs .
some things have to happen , that 's just the way the universe works .
it 's monday night at _num_ am , and you are hungry .
so you stop here .
because that was the thing that was always going to happen .
it 's normally really dirty in there too..
had to get a lighter last night .
did you know you get carded for lighters these days ?
so , i go back in to get one .
i select a lovely orange one .
the girl who cashed me out was not the same one as before .
her : can i see your id ?
me : you need to see my id ?
other girl behind the counter : she 's never checked you out before .
me : oh , she 's `` checked me out '' before .
everyone blushes .
the wait in the long line at the stand is worth it .
custard cup was my friends and i 's place to go in the summers !
they have the best tasting custard around !
you can create your own mixture with their large variety of toppings !
it kind of reminds you of a dairy queen but sooo much better !
the place to go for ice cream/custard/sundaes .
yum i love jarlings !
!
a champaign institution !
all the flavors and toppings are delicious .
example of how good this place is ...
my dad does n't eat ice cream very often .
my parents rarely ever have it in the freezer .
he 's actually a bit lactose intolerant .
jarling 's is quite the summer afternoon and evening delight .
; )
stock up for the wintertime !
custard cup is exactly one of those places .
i highly recommend the vanilla cold fudge sundae ... yum .
this place is a landmark in cu .
not too expensive , great variety , comforting ambiance .
a+
a unique treat in the cu area .
i only wish it were closer to campus .
i highly recommend the lemon custard .
next birthday do n't bake - try a jarling 's illini pie .
or one of their other ice cream pies .
i have n't found anything anywhere to beat that !
i 'm definitely dropping by here after i get off the plane .
lines can be long , but service is pretty good .
it 's good , but getting more expensive every year .
too bad it 's _num_ miles away .
luckily my parents still live there !
goddamn i miss this place .
cold stone creamery has got nothing on custard cup .
smart choice on their part .
i really like that you can add banana to anything too !
they love it and its pretty cheap .
yummmmmm .
custard than actually eating it !
it 's a shame this place closes for the winter .
delicious custard , reasonable prices , nice service , retro decor .
good god do i miss this place .
it is delicious .
there are chemicals in it , that make you crave it fortnightly .
so many options , and only one short life .
it all made sense after the first time i went .
i think this place is a little overrated .
my custard was a little too soft and not creamy at all .
i would rather have culvers .
i love this place .
it 's a staple from college and worth a trip here everytime .
snowstorm , maybe ) :
_num_ custard or ice cream or frozen yogurt or whatever you want to call it
_num_ peanut butter cups
where in this list do you see peanuts ?
try telling that to jarling 's .
and it was admittedly delicious .
actually , i guess that is what i 'm saying .
shit never went down like that in california .
love it .
one of my favorite establishments in the wonderful city of champaign .
i only wish that places like this existed in evanston !
it 's good .
but there 's so much hype about it that i expected more .
indoor seating would be nice on a hot summer day .
the whole establishment screams of midwest country homemade ice cream/custard/whatever .
i love jarlings !
every time i come and visit champaign , i have a craving for jarlings .
their ice cream and custard is the epitome of comfort .
their peach shakes is one of my favorites .
but do n't forget , they accept cash and personal check only .
no plastic .
you are a delicious custardy fiesta .
tasty time .
i like custard .
jarlings sells custard .
therefore , i like jarlings .
i 'm not sure what they are doing with the industrial-sized kitchen area .
then the workers scoop the custard out of the bin .
fascinating .
that 's cool .
: d the fruit flavors are still my favorite too .
cash only
brought here by my fiance , a townie .
it 's everything he said it would be and more .
i like the vanilla custard with butterscotch , or the orange custard by itself .
i really like the atmosphere here .
the frozen custard itself ?
nothing out of the ordinary .
i mean , of course its good , its cold , creamy and sweet .
but so is the ice cream from anywhere else .
amazing frozen custard .
the stuff is just great .
overpriced and bland .
they all tasted like regular eggy custard .
if i closed my eyes i would n't be able to tell them apart .
the only flavor that seems to be good here is the chocolate .
otherwise , save your money and your time and just go somewhere else .
it 's pretty good stuff , although a little pricey .
i 'm a fan of the cold fudge and tortoise sundaes .
and the waffle cones- yum .
great custard and great service .
a chambana classic .
you must go !
just like the `` old days '' .
this place is true americana ! !
!
the custard is delicious and there are quite a few varieties to choose from .
) .
this was my first time visiting while down seeing my son at college .
stop by and savor this treat ! !
!
custard cup is another of my defining childhood spots .
i always have been and always will be a slave to their lemon custard .
yum !
i 've grown up with custard cup , and i love it .
they 'll do it for you .
peanut butter cup with chocolate ?
yes indeed .
do n't be scared of lemon , it 's it 's heavenly .
as a note : no credit cards , only cash or check .
closes at _num_ , so not so much for the late night cravings .
the only custard i am familiar with is flan , but what 's this ?
it comes in ice cream form too ?
i definitely would like to try their pies next time also .
especially considering the price .
trust me i am an expert on frozen desserts .
also , they have green river slushees which i 've never found anywhere else !
- heeaavvennlly custard
- reasonable prices/sizes
- great parking and outdoor seating
- awesome service
everyone in champaign knows custard cup .
i usually just stick with the snowstorms and i have never been disappointed .
: o (
the service here is great too .
all the people who work there are awesome , fast and efficient .
haha
they also have a crapload of parking , which is awesome .
and outdoor seating with umbrellas !
this is a local tradition and curiosity .
a seasonal custard stand .
i brought my new york friends to wait in the lines .
there are only a few kinds of custard .
the lemon and the orange are exceptional .
this is the only five star food review i have posted for champaign-urbana .
i 've never had frozen custard until i lived in champaign .
let me just say that this stuff is amazing ! !
prior to this i was a huge fan of dairy queen .
i 'll never look at dq the same way again .
custard is n't really like anything i 've tried before .
it 's rich and creamy .
come here for the lemon custard .
and the prices are extremely reasonable .
i was lucky in college .
i had friends with cars or i had a car to drive to jarlings .
i 'm not kidding .
things i love :
- strawberry shortcake snowstorm
- pumpkin pie snowstorm ( seasonal .
lucky me visits during the season )
- vanilla custard with chocolate/butterscotch sauce .
- strawberry custard
- any float
there 's nothing that hits the spot as well as jarlings .
seriously , jarlings is that good .
to those drawing similarities between their product and ice cream ?
you 're gastronomically challenged .
yes they are both cold and dairy based , but it ends there .
their custard is obviously so much denser and creamier than ice cream .
ice cream by process has to have a bunch of air stirred into it .
jarlings inc world wide could have an ipo greater than google 's
; )
boy do i loooooove custard cup !
i 'm not a big ice cream person , but this stuff is awesome !
mmmm i want some jarlings right now ! !
it 's way better than cold stone , marble slab & dq combined !
!
jarling 's a darling .
pretty rockin ' !
a : vailable seating outside .
even in november .
: o )
you 're too late .
: o (
n : ever too cold to eat frozen custard .
why are you open seasonally ? ?
!
s : uper smooth frozen custard !
i would go every day .
i miss it !
i never ordered anything i did n't like .
the only downside is cash-only .
yum.yum.yum .
i am so happy when this place is open ! !
!
cash only .
but for this treat i do n't mind stopping at the atm beforehand .
now stay open all year long !
this is place is just awesome .
i highly recommend the strawberry cheesecake with strawberry custard snowstorm
boy was i in for a treat .
the portion for was quite large for a small cup too .
definitely going to come back again in my future trips .
we were in champaign for a wedding and stopped here .
had a couple snowstorms .
both were excellent .
pros : tastes like ice cream
cons : custard melts too quickly , slow service , incompetent staff
it did not live up to all the fuss .
they guy that took our order clearly had no clue what he was doing .
even then it took forever for our order to be made .
when they finally got the order up to the window it was already melting .
the snowstorm was smooth and had a rich peanut butter flavor to it .
on the other hand , i ended up literally drinking it .
i was n't impressed .
good custard , little pricy though .
i recently also visited their danville location .
brilliant !
bring friends .
there 's really nothing like sharing an experience like this with friends .
the atmosphere here is friendly and welcoming .
the custard also invites you to eat it .
sigh .
i know i 'm about to commit champaign-urbana blasphemy , but ...
i do n't get the hype .
pretty tasty .
i got a single scoop of chocolate .
yeah , i know boring , right ?
but it was chocolate done right .
very creamy and chocolaty .
.
this is a must-try of champaign
best place ever .
loved this place as a kid .
one of the few things i miss about champaign ... haha .
apparently this is tom hank 's favorite place , how do i know that ?
i went _num_ out of the _num_ days i was in town visiting .
needless to say , i polished off both cups of custard each time .
i have nothing against this custard place .
its old school , and an institution i 'm sure .
however , in my humble fat opinion , custard sucks .
it is just not that good of a dairy dessert .
anyway , not my thing .
say it ai n't so - what 's next , curtis orchard ?
?
pretty awesome .
other than that , i love custard cup .
i never feel like it 's officially summer until this place is open !
best custard in town .
loves .
fantastic local biz .
snicker parfait is a winner , as is the praline snowstorm .
pretty much hard to go wrong with anything on the menu here !
i also tried a small vanilla sundae with their signature cold fudge - wow .
also got ta love the fact that they have a drive-thru !
: - )
chambananites ,
thank you for introducing me to this place .
mainly i recall my past experience of rock-solid curd that everyone calls custard .
it is that good !
long lines , throngs of teenagers , closes relatively early - sure .
but the custard is sooo worth the wait !
wonderful !
and honestly , you ca n't beat those prices .
just do n't forget to bring cash ( or a check ) .
just do it .
just went to jarling 's after lunch at yellowfin .
urgent update :
they now have gummy bears .
thank you , jarling 's .
i love this place .
it 's not the best , but it ' s definitely not the worst .
jarling 's cares nothing for trends , for fashion , for progress .
it 's jarling 's .
it 's beyond cool .
it 's eternal .
good custard .
they can make about anything .
great custard !
definitely will go again !
not too much to really say , it 's just good .
really good .
it 's got great ice cream and other frozen treats .
some of the best i 've had and the prices are reasonable too .
great service , great ice cream , great place .
hmmm , not bad but i have had creamier custard .
i tried the limited edition cherries jubilee with cold fudge topping .
husband 's chocolate custard with almonds on top was a much better choice .
we did n't wait in line and the service was fine .
i 'd be happy to use paper and eat faster !
cash only , kids , or take your old-fashioned checkbook .
i always get sad and anxious when jarling 's closes in november .
my usual order is the grasshopper snowstorm .
the smallest portion is still too big .
i wish they had an even smaller size !
perfect for kids ... or a college student .
five stars for their wide selection of choices and toppings .
seriously hugeeeee menu .
their ice cream is really smooth and soft and tasty .
it is kind of semi-expensive nowadays though .
i 'd be nice if things were about 30-50cents cheaper .
i usually keep it simple with a chocolate chip cookie dough snowstorm .
the smallest size makes me full .
their ice cream/custard is seriously like the best i 've ever had ever..
anywhere .
i can vouch this for their vanilla and lemon custards .
minus one for cash only .
i hate carrying cash .
so awesome .
i get the same thing every time because it is so darn good !
lemon custard .
that 's all i want .
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it .
whenever i come home , i have to get some custard cup .
sometimes there are lines that go out the door .
but be patient ... it 's so worth it .
and it 's just a sign that this stuff is good , right ?
they now have a drive-thru which is really cool .
the scooped custard is nice , smooth , and creamy .
perfect texture .
you can also buy the frozen custard in bulk .
i will get a pint and it will last me for a few days .
now that i have self-control that is .
so something to think about .
excellent custard , good shakes , good blizzards , etc .
very crowded most of the time .
very good custard .
recommed the georgia peach .
so delicious .
lemon custard with cold fudge is a favorite !
i am not a big ice cream or frozen custard fan .
i started a new job and was asked if i wanted something from jarlkings .
since they were buying i said ok i will try it .
i ordered the special for simplistic sakes .
i surely could not pick one thing out of all the choices they have .
the special was a carmel apple snowstorm and it is fantastic .
hands down answer was custard cup cold fudge .
what is cold fudge ?
how is it different from all the other 's ?
i liked that it tasted like real natural chocolate .
all i can say is , i am officially hooked .
apparently this is the place to go for custard , and i agree !
they also offer a weekly specialty flavor .
i also suggest getting a pint or quart to go .
it 's much cheaper than eating an order there .
seasonal place that is always a favorite .
a bit off campus but worth the drive .
honestly ... ..awful ! ! !
!
get the cold fudge sundae .
absurd wait time .
we waited in a line of ~15 people for _num_ minutes .
i timed the group in front of us ( _num_ orders ) .
no business this inefficient should be around .
but obviously the ice cream is good .
i rate frozen custard places on one criterion : chocolate chips .
jarling 's does that right , and earns my champaign loyalty .
so glad that summer is back ... .
best ice cream in champaign !
the banana chocolate chip snowstorm and the oatmeal cookie snowstorm are amazing !
custard cup never seems to let down .
...
a little dirt never killed anyone though , right ?
either way , custard cup is still the greatest .
pointers :
one dip = one 'scoop , ' two dips = two 'scoops '
snowstorms are comparable to mcflurries
they 're seasonal ( closed during the winter )
& min of $ _num_ for credit cards
it 's a mom & pop ice cream place .
what 's not to like ?
so good !
the milkshake was amazing !
definitely worth a stop .
absolutely delicious !
get the small size and let your taste buds go to heaven .
this is the place to get frozen custard .
heaven in a cup .
'nuff said .
best ice-cream in chambana !
you just ca n't beat jarling 's !
i love the cold fudge sundae !
jarlings holds a special place in our hearts .
it 's the best ice cream place in town .
they also do n't have hot fudge and get fussy if you ask .
luckily the custard is good enough that it eclipses any grievances .
when we move away someday , i know i will miss this custard sorely .
an absolute five-star dessert place .
their custards are to die for !
they offer a different 'flavor of the week ' every week .
of the ones i tried , found peach and peppermint to be super yummy !
old school custard .
you ca n't live here without trying it .
what was i thinking ?
skip your forgettable entrees and come here instead .
delicious !
i love love love jarling 's !
so good !
my grams always gets their cold fudge and that 's super yummy as well .
a champaign institution and not to be missed !
i love jarling 's custard .
every time i try something new , i 'm never disappointed .
everything here tastes divine , so do n't be afraid to experiment !
also , junior cups are huge , so order in moderation .
anyways , i decided to go with the tortoise snowstorm .
it was quickly corrected to a tortoise snow storm .
i also ordered a teddy cup of the cake batter ice cream .
a dip would have been _num_ , but the t cup was _num_ .
not really worth it in my opinion .
i was a bit confused by my snowstorm , to be honest .
it said it was vanilla custard , although it came out looking like chocolate .
the tortoise is supposed to feature cold fudge , almonds , and butterscotch .
for my snowstorm , it was a different color , so i was confused .
i had a bit of his , and it was much better than mine .
the cake batter custard was nothing special , to be honest .
there are multiple benches inside , as well as a drivethru .
while eating , _num_ wonderlake fire dept trucks pulled on both sides of us .
_num_ dollars for our _num_ dishes .
i always try to try something new .
but seriously .
service is a little slow but snowstorms are definitely made with love .
you ca n't rush a good thing !
everyone i 've talked to has been personable and friendly .
and now i 'm craving custard , great .
i remember visiting my uncle and going to jarlings custard cup as a child .
i 'm an adult now and it was just as delicious as i remember !
cute quintessential stop on a hot sunny day after a game of tennis .
luckily it was n't too hot and sunny so it was n't crowded .
there 's also a drive thru for those on the go .
the custard single dip is plentiful on a waffle cone .
this place has so many flavors , it puts dq to shame .
so cheap , great vintage feel , outdoor seating .
short drive off campus .
a champaign-urbana institution .
the pies and ice cream sandwiches are great too .
cold fudge shake = heaven .
seriously .
i think it 's my favorite cold dessert of all time .
only give it 4/5 stars because their service is slow .
and i 'm a slow coffee-drinker .
fantastically amazing custard !
the cold fudge sundae with vanilla custard is my favorite thing on the menu .
the pumpkin pie snowstorm ( seasonal ) takes a close second .
we just discovered they sell frozen custard cookie sandwiches which are also yummy .
it 's so delicious !
it 's great for the summer days definitely .
excellent frozen treats for hot summer nights .
the menu is more than just custard .
rootbeer floats and other combinations ) .
lemon custard really hit the spot for me .
i personally think that this place is a little bit overrated .
the place definitely had revisit values with their seasonal surprise flavor of the week .
my personal favorite is their vanilla sundae with crushed peanuts .
it will not disappoint you !
a great , home-town ice cream spot .
no doubt you are getting a fun experience when you come here .
so be prepared with cash unless you are buying for you group/family !
my go-to ice cream place in the summer !
that being said , this place is awesome and very fairly priced .
get out there , check it and yelp it !
wow .
it 's a frosty treat that 's like ice cream but ... creamier ?
curse you , custard gods !
i went with a mint chocolate chip snowstorm and it was the perfect treat .
i dig this place !
moments !
worth the wait in my opinion though !
if you want your frozen custard to stay frozen , come in february .
the price for that is a bit hefty .
if you like thick , flavorful custard , stick to culver 's .
otherwise just go to coldstone and get freaking ice cream .
i also love how its a central hubbub for townies during warm summer nights .
it 's definitely a place to visit , but maybe just once .
not bad right ?
well the scoops were rather small and did i mention i prefer ice cream ?
only 3* for decent taste .
this is such a local gem .
everyone from the _num_ knows this place as a symbol of their childhood .
the crazy lines are part of the experience .
use it as an opportunity to observe the townies , we 're interesting people .
cold fudge is their specialty , and yeah , it really is better cold .
who does n't love lemon custard ?
so refreshing !
and really great in a lemon chiffon snowstorm .
the only negative is the long lines - but still worth it !
we had _num_ cups of custard with sauce and _num_ waffle cne .
good stuff , service seemed a bit slow ... .
people who had friends , had them cut in line .
reasonably priced , great tasting custard and sundaes .
they now accept cards as payment , and their service is always solid .
best ice cream in the area , hands down .
restaurant review
frozen custard , just what you need on a hot summer day .
just a random fact for the day .
the ice cream `` custard '' is super smooth .
you can eat right outside the benches or drive through .
all and all this place is simply amazing !
pro : inexpensive ice cream `` custard '' , fast service
hidden gem :
snowstorm card , for every _num_ you buy you get one free
stopped at this local favorite while in the c-u area last week .
the mediums are a good size ( i wan na say _num_ oz . ?
) , though a bit expensive at $ _num_ .
this left both him and dad with melted custard when they returned .
is the heatwave burning up your body ?
well , this place will bring a wonderful cool breeze to your exhausted soul .
i personally had a banana split and it was absolutely amazing .
i got the peanut butter cup junior snowstorm custard cup and it was amazing !
very delicious and filling .
a _num_ oz junior size cup is all you need , guaranteed .
the custard seemed to melt relatively fast though .
i only have been here once , but i definitely would recommend it .
the service is so slow it 's ridiculous .
it can take 20-30 minutes for a cup .
it 's an okay product but the service is unbearable .
jarlings custard cup.. quite the urbana champaign institution it is .
and deservedly so .
and so worth the wait .
greatest ice cream ever .
first , the vanilla custard and cold fudge are great .
best ice cream place in town .
i love their snow storm .
every time i ordered big one .
sitting outside with it .
life is so good .
only it is a pity that it closes at winter : (
one of my favorite desert palces in town .
they have the best custard with soo many toppings to choose from .
: )
a nice place to hangout and get something sweet on a warm day .
a big selection and the custard is creamy and delicious .
the same person who takes the order , makes the order .
the owners could n't care less that there far better ways to do things .
hire _num_ more people .
one person , takes orders and money , another makes the order .
the time would be cut b _num_ % .
care about the customer .
except for one .
pick the shortest of three lines .
its old school .
made fresh daily .
worth the wait .
best custard available in central illinois .
first time there over the weekend and i ordered a berry delightful snowstorm .
very refreshing !
plus it moves fast .
tried a bite of the cold fudge and wow .
so good ! !
no other words to describe it .
i use to come here frequently .
unfortunately , the new owners/management have not figured how to run the place .
it takes way to long to get through the line .
i hope this improves !
i visit this place everytime i come to champaign..perfect place for an evening snack
delicious custard prepared in a huge variety of ways .
be sure to bring cash !
this place is a nice little gem in champaign .
i suggest the vanilla custard with cold fudge .
it is absolutely delicious .
who knew that cold fudge would be better than the classic hot fudge ?
there are plenty of seats outside , and there is a large parking lot .
i usually get the lemon custard .
so creamy and refreshing !
ah , the memories .
i have been coming here since the _num_ 's .
i probably have hundreds of visits here .
i spent nearly all of that decade at uni here .
and i just graduated an offspring as well .
no trip to cu is complete without a stop here .
heck , i used to walk here from far .
i 've had sundaes , but love the snowstorm .
the fruit ones are my favorite .
the lines are long .
there are three lines , one for each window .
they move slowly since everything is hand dipped .
no extruders here .
marriages have been contracted in these lines .
ltrs have broken up in these lines .
they have abundant outdoor seating and a drive-thru .
check it out -- classic and good .
always delivers .
an apparent local institution and tom hanks recommended .
the good : classic frozen treat stand .
tons of flavor combinations with their snowstorms ( mix in shakes or blizzards ) .
reasonable prices .
the other treats ordered by earlier guests looked quite a bit more generous .
superb .
i pretty much go here constantly when they 're open for the season .
it makes winter all the worse with no custard cup .
snowstorms are an obvious go to here .
just go and keep going .
there 's so much menu to explore and it 's all incredible .
i adore jarling 's .
it is the embodiment of an old time ice cream shoppe .
i have gone here ever since i was a little kid .
thank goodness for the new owners !
do not let the sizes deceive you ; the smalls are pretty large !
i had a kid sized strawberry with cold fudge and peanuts on top .
that hit the spot !
the strawberry flavor is subtle .
for some reason it gives a different feeling than hot fudge .
some people may say that it is pricey for what you order .
this is not how it works !
there are _num_ windows and _num_ different lines .
in my experience , the window on the very left is the shortest !
snowstorm .
but it was good ! !
!
oh the custard is oh so good !
just fantastic !
love love love .
great custard and very reasonable prices .
!
i can not complain about this place as everyone seems to love it .
have only been here once , had the mint cookie snowstorm !
so delicious , i 'll definitely stop here whenever i come back .
jarling 's is the best place to get ice cream in the c-u area .
i have been going to this place every summer for years !
it is unlike anything i 've had before .
i highly recommend trying this one !
they lock the doors at exactly _num_ pm .
it 's hard to get frozen custard wrong .
the snowstorm i had was very good .
the atmosphere was very nostalgic of an old ice cream parlor .
the lines were so long many had to wait outside .
definitely worth the price - and wait .
this is very good frozen custard and the toppings are great as well .
i will be back for sure .
it 's frozen custard , not yogurt or ice cream .
i 'm probably not a fan of custard .
but definitely worth a try because its the most famous dessert place in town !
talk about a c-u tradition .
there 's also outdoor seating !
; d
you ca n't go wrong .
very good custard as always , if you like rich frozen goodness .
look no further .
you seriously ca n't be in the champaign-urbana area with out getting some !
outstanding frozen custard in a great atmosphere .
best ice cream place in champaign .
grasshopper with cold fudge= best damn thing i 've ever had
everything i 've tried from here hit 's the spot .
i wish they 'd stay open year round .
okay , so i may be reprimanded for this rating !
i do n't get how this is good 'custard ' .
if custard stands for froyo-ish ice cream then yes it 's good .
and the lemon one is the best flavour .
but , imho , this is not custard .
i love this place ... . it is five stars .
their cold fudge is the best .
sign in the window says , closed for the season .
hello ? ! ? !
it 's still summer ! ! !
what the hell ? ! ? ? ! ! !
!
jarling 's is a local ice cream gem !
so why is this a _num_ star review and not a _num_ star review ?
additional word of caution : you *will* be cut in line .
awesome custard .
horrible customer service .
kind of like wal-mart .
the only downside is that it is pretty small and can get really crowded .
the best icecream place in town !
try the coconut , lemon custard
the `` custard '' at this place is good but definitely not the best .
waited over an hour on a sunday night around 8pm .
the reason for the long wait is that they are super inefficient .
now on to the ice cream .
it 's good , but definitely nothing out of this world .
if it were anywhere else , it would n't be so popular .
it 's just that this is the only custard place in town .
they have benches for seating outside .
also a drive through line .
this place is only open during the summer .
today i took my boyfriend to jarling 's because he 'd never been .
it took about _num_ minutes in line before we got to order .
i am used to waiting there so that was n't a problem .
still tastes delicious as always and i still have n't tried the cold fudge .
i always go with _num_ dips in a cone .
my boyfriend had a brownie snowstorm .
we enjoyed our dessert and will be back .
; )
jarling 's is definitely one of the major highlights of summer time in cu .
anyways , it 's better late than never .
i love their snowstorms , and sundaes .
they taste fresh , creamy and yum .
what can i say , i 'm optimistic .
i ordered a fruit cup snow storm , because fruits are healthy .
it had strawberries and banana , could n't taste any other fruit .
by the time , i took picture it had melted .
but still , tasted gooooood .
gon na try as many flavors as i can till summer lasts .
long wait for ok ice cream .
ended up leaving out of frustration .
jarling 's custard cup is a champaign institution .
my husband usually gets regular custard ( any flavor ) in a cone .
our family members have gotten a variety of different snowstorms and are never disappointed .
you really ca n't go wrong here .
check it out !
typical kfc food , but at this location .
if i had to imagine the most depressing place it is here .
the soda machine dispenses the tears of clowns along with pepsi .
restaurant review
you have these a different standard when evaluating this .
i ended up coming here take lunch out .
the chicken itself was prepared well with oil that was fresh .
if i crave fried chicken i will be back .
the service here was also friendly and i had no issues
pros : cheap lunchtime meal combos
cons : not healthy
hidden deals :
check out the different meal deals available
love this station .
love this gas station .
i will go out of my way to go here .
answering questions like `` what do you have like miller lite ? ''
( the answer is , the water cooler is right over there ) .
try try , or have try ?
try try .
gah ! ! !
i can finally take a quick smoke break .
finally ! ! !
darnitalltoheck ! ! !
so you put out the smoke .
you are down to one .
you finally get everyone out just after closing time .
two packs , you reply .
she still does n't laugh .
this is not a gas station ! ! !
this is the twilight zone ! !
!
the service dept is excellent ... too bad my car was not .
we did not have a good experience there .
we wo n't go back .
i have received poor service from this kfc location many times .
ranging from no napkins at the drive-thru ( a big pet peeve of mine !
( i know ...
gross ! )
!
ridiculous they are that slow .
i ended up going to arby 's & got served right away .
i 'll never go back to this kfc !
first , i was in a large group .
not a single apology .
the fries had a stale chemical taste .
the root beer float was abysmal .
after finishing my fries , i noticed a small bug walking across the wrapper .
terrible .
amazingly , worse than i expected .
my food was fine , but the way it was handled was alarming .
frightening .
wow such negative reviews !
i had a good experience here on both drive thru and walk in .
several employees on staff , clean and fast service .
seriously .
worst .
kfc .
ever .
i hate chain restaurants .
especially fast food .
every time i 've been here , i 've been unsatisfied .
my last experience here was my worst .
waited in the drive thru for _num_ minutes as the only car .
if it were only me , i would have laughed and drove away .
that was it .
certainly not convenient , cheap , or tasty .
the employees have all been some serious twats also .
i do n't believe any positive reviews came from actual customers .
i used the drive-thru .
the employee that took my order , jasmine , was patient and friendly .
the biscuit and two piece combo was delicious .
actually my real rating is _num_ ...
! !
worst kfc experience ever !
pretty simple ... not rocket science .
pulled up to the window and the order was messed up .
instead of two meals they only had one .
i gave my order again two more times , each time slowly .
this was more than disappointing ...
this place is really bad !
do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else .
seriously !
!
one star for location .
one star for having a drive through .
however , when said drive through is slow and inaccurate it renders itself useless .
and you forgot the lettuce and the tomatoes are tasteless .
i ca n't say i will never go back because it 's a subway .
you like it one day and hate it thenext .
terrible terrible employees , worst customer service i 've received in a while .
we had to walk out without our food .
i 'm shocked at how confrontational this employee was .
slow service .
i 'm watching this kid make my sandwich with the pace of a snail .
he 's waiting for the toaster to beep for the person behind me .
meanwhile my sandwich is just sitting there on the counter .
the girl is just standing there .
doing nothing to help .
next time i should go to jimmy johns .
i cant say enough good things about the customer service i have received here .
ty especially has been a real pleasure to work with .
highly recommend !
angela , the store manager is a super star !
angela was very diligent in adding the right colors so it matched perfectly !
thank you again , angela !
very poor customer service here , especially displayed by store manager angela .
i 'm the customer standing here ready to make a purchase .
i 'll go to lowes next time
not the same domino 's pizza i ate too much of in college .
vastly different and a major improvement !
friendly delivery by john .
price is fair .
much , much better than pizza hut !
easy ordering-on-line .
made exactly as i asked for .
piping hot .
sauce is so , so much better than their old stuff .
crust is like having an order of buttery-garlic soft bread sticks with your pizza .
i can tell that it is hand-made fresh .
my first choice in chain pizzas .
was d'moes .
now , 1st off - i live at summitt ( by bob ) .
these guys gladly delivered to me , all the way down there !
major props for that .
wikipedia that ish ladies and gent 's ; kansas city bullriders ) .
well , the driver and my door man both called _num_ times .
maybe he had a slice with us ?
who really knows these things .
it was pretty darn good .
hmmmm ... .
potential there ... .
never has crushed peppers !
but the pizza ai n't too shabby .
the pizza was n't horrible , but the deal was awful .
low rating is for price vs. quality , and value .
way too greasy , and it was definitely stale , old grease .
ended up throwing half the pizza out because it just tasted so bad .
cheese only was edible , but anything we had with toppings was bad .
not coming back .
i have always ordered pizza from dominos and the delivery have been so so .
i 'll get my food and it 'll be okay warm and okay good .
but tonight i got something different .
i got a hot sub , bacon and ranch sub .
it he food was so hot that u could n't even touch it .
never have i ever gotten delivery that was super hot .
it was so good ; - ) extremely satisfied with the service and food .
thank you .
worst customer service ever !
the manager jason is very rude and does n't take ownership for his mistakes .
screwed up our orders 2/3 times we 've ordered there .
wo n't be giving them business again !
one would think that all domino 's are created equally ... . nope !
this one i on the worst list .
but service is lacking big time .
not a single smile or hello when we walked in the door .
we felt like we were bothering them .
we will likely opt for the other locations from now on .
short and sweet ... received the pizza i ordered correctly , fast and friendly .
pizza was hot and great ...
each and everytime the order is awesome !
no complaints use the online tracker not as much salt and grease et al .
as papa johns ( sorry ) ... ..
keep up the good work
i would give them a zero if i could .
the manager hung up on me when i was trying to report an issue .
worst service ever .
hope they enjoy the pizza and chicken they made and never delivered .
what a way to make it right , wrong !
i 'm disgusted..
u could tell the guy who answered the phone was pissed off .
no thanks !
worst manager experience ever !
we called in a cheese pizza .
literally .
just cheese .
the manager was taking the phone calls and hung up on us multiple times !
would n't give us our total for delivery .
unreal .
spoke to our awesome delivery driver who said everyone complains about this manager !
denny , donny , tommy ... something like that .
duh the pizza was great but this manager should n't work with the public .
filling our order this evening , failed miserably .
when i received my ready to pick up prompt , i drove over .
only pizza was ready .
i waited for wings .
i opened the pizza and it was also incorrect .
kj provided great customer service , so i was not as upset anymore .
i arrived home and the pizza was still wrong .
needless to say our dinner was ruined .
i have never experienced such a lack of concern for providing customer good service .
the disregard shown today is a health code violation in the making .
just an all around good guy !
and the pizza was yummy !
!
i use the online ordering system , and it is simple .
however pizza is pizza , so it was yummy in the tummy .
the delivery drivers are always friendly , and smiling .
this location is definitely my go to pizza place .
`` viad tower restaurants ''
what a great find .
this is a nice upscale cafeteria style restaurant .
everything is homemade from carved sandwiches to pizza and daily specials .
it was chicken enchiladas yesterday .
it was great and huge .
i could not finish it .
the prices are very reasonable .
i will be back next time i 'm in the neighborhood !
okay , for cafeteria food the viad cafeteria really is n't that bad .
th fish was over cooked .
the sitting area is clean and nice .
only eat here if you are stuck in this building and pressed for time .
found this place on yelp .
i was at a conference at the dept .
of ed .
and saw it was across the street .
wonderful atmosphere , quiet and good food .
nice variety of food and great view .
very nice place .
good atmosphere .
saw this on yelp and gave it a try .
nice place , great view and good food .
it 's a cafeteria , do not expect `` nobou '' .
for what it is , it 's very nice .
not a bad place at all .
i always expect a cafeteria/lunch place to be kind of blah .
not bad for cafeteria food .
the chicken alfredo was a step above fazoli 's quality .
) , qdoba ( ugh ) and the like .
sonja is great !
she will go above and beyond !
i 'm pleased with her services and would n't trust anyone else .
i refer clients to sonja .
while some were beyond help , she has helped others who thought they were .
do not add insult ( or anguish ) to injury .
insurance companies represent your interest after theirs , if at all .
attorneys settle .
representing themselves , then the insurance companies , then you .
not sonja - she puts you 1st !
sonja will aggressively represent you !
think you do n't need an attorney ?
should n't you know ?
call her .
i am a worker 's comp and ss attorney here in phoenix .
she is very responsive and caring to her clients .
i highly recommend her .
sonja duckstein is the epitome of a client first mentality .
sonja and her paralegal marcy are great .
they helped a friend in a time of great stress .
i ca n't thank you enough for your kindness and determination .
this parking garage is below the palomar , golds gym , breakfast club .
i used this garage on a saturday .
the parking was free that saturday morning .
i 'm not sure of the rates .
i dislike parking garages .
they are not the most secure place to park .
i was able to find a park right next to the elevator .
i would use this agaon if i cant find street parking .
horrible .
we were on level _num_ .
lots of angry people were getting out of their cars to investigate .
ridiculous .
i mean is n't that part of what staffing consultants do ?
administering evaluations , placing candidates and contacting other branches about current candidates ?
parking is relatively easy to find and the offices are clean and inviting .
good luck !
run from this company !
rude and have no clue when working with mortgage proccessors .
post jobs that are n't available .
say they submitted and its a immediate hire position .
!
totally a joke !
they should stick to labor jobs !
unprofessional rude staff .
veronica has worse personality of all !
they compete with each other and do not care about you !
high school games
stick with better known staffing firms like adecco , randstant etc
veronica is probably the only person who knows whats going on at this place .
i played here once and thought this spot was pretty cool .
the music was average , some latin pop/dance stuff .
again , sorry but it was the truth .
had a couple of drinks and left .
did n't even go hang around the under _num_ section downstairs .
just kidding , i would never do that .
ooooohhhh
haaahaaa wow
no
nope
never again
from what i remember ( and was told ! ! )
we had a blast here !
drank and danced after a suns game for about _num_ hours .
great time , will go back for another !
do n't waste your night there !
even with our buzz , this place was a bust !
$ _num_ cover , no hats , and they steal your id .
how is this garbage still in business ? ?
?
my female best friend and i were in town for the night , road-tripping .
i 'll skip some details here , and make a long story short :
i bit my tongue .
the point of this whole review is this :
ladies , watch out for this sleazeball bartender .
he 'll try to get into your pants by the most disrespectable means .
this place is a joke .
saturday night they had like _num_ dollar amfs .
thats cheap .
and they had _num_ dollar beers .
thats cheap .
seemed like a decent place .
call me crazy but is n't there anywhere in phoenix to dance .
god forbid you go to sky lounge on a saturday night .
omg .
waaaah .
so we left .
the staff was so rude !
1st door guy said we could come in for free anytime fri night .
we came back about _num_ min later .
the place was ghetto and empty .
sorry sky lounge , you suck .
lol
dont use your credit/debit card !
do n't know why lots of people dislike this place for .
i think it 's pretty cool .
i had a good time here .
been here over a dozen times , had some good and some bad .
overall the place is okay with me .
gets pretty packed on the weekends .
this place is awesome !
i usually get the vip on the second floor .
from foam parties to all dressed in white events !
latin/electro/hip hop bar/club.. if that is a thing .
that 's what sky lounge is .
down stairs looked very empty .
upstairs ... oh dear ... it was packed .
a lot of randoms were just sitting and stole some beer from another table .
just .
great ... lol .
summary :
music awesome .
vip service needs improvements
got two beers .
guinness and pabst .
expired and bad .
replaced with miller high life .
same thing .
over two years old .
terrible service .
do n't get beer here .
_num_ star is more than this place deserves .
it tasted like horrible meat and was so over-seasoned .
the staff was horrible .
i would never go back to this place again .
do not come here ! !
!
food poisoning alert ! !
today is monday and i am still sick .
we think it was the ranch dressing that came with the meal .
thanks for ruining our vacation !
there was no cover for ladies but it was $ _num_ for guys .
oh and we came on a saturday night around 11:30 for context .
the first floor is 18+ and it was hip hop/latin .
the second level is 21+ and it was hip hop/latin .
when it comes to music and atmosphere , it 's great .
i would give zero stars if it were an option .
if i could give this place zero stars , i would .
that 's got to be the most annoying shit ever !
!
this place is always turnt !
i always like coming thru with my friends on friday and saturday night .
definitely gon na bring my fraternity bros here !
the cover is $ _num_ .
ask if you get lost and the security or bartenders will point you there .
i like the size of the floor , which is tile .
also note there is a strict dress code - it is posted outside .
they do have metal detectors going in .
however , i have rarely seen any fights and i feel safe here .
lots of security and bouncers .

think `` the matrix '' meets `` blade . ''
solution for the yelper : if you can , drink before you go .
seating : maybe , just maybe , invest in another velvetine sectional or two .
club pallazzo certainly charges enough for cover to afford a new couch .
the ambiance : the inside is gorgeous .
the dj i like also dj 's at le homme on wed. nights .
but overall the music is good .
i know some people that go every weekend .
if i did that , i would be living in the alleyway behind tranz .
if i found a place better than tranz i 'd be there .
came here twice on 'goth ' night .
both times the place was dead .
that right there should 've been a warning about the patronage of this place .
still , the dj played great music and the decor is gorgeous .
the drinks were a bit pricey though , so bring a flask .
but when i am in town again , i will return .
this is definetly a goth club .
i really like this place .
what sold me completely ?
the dj played a reeeally good mix of music .
we 'd been there the first week of oct'09 . ]
if its not your speed , there are two other clubs literally next door .
as we left , we noticed club downtown next door was *still* poppin ' .
__________________________
smoothest `` i got hit on '' moment ever .
ca n't be simply re-told , only re-enacted .
omg , i 'm sooooo sad .
i 'm such an individual i need to look like everyone else ... .
ok , so i got my emo/goth rant out of the way .
i went on a friday night ( 10/14/2011 ) .
there was no cover all night for guys and girls .
the decor is beautiful , good amount of seating .
it 's a one room club with ample space .
the dj played hip-hop , top _num_ , good stuff !
mgt seemed inviting and friendly .
i and the rest of the group def .
enjoyed ourselves because we were so many .
but if more people start going it would probably get _num_ stars !
absolutely horrible place !
i will never set foot in a building where my friends get assaulted .
every venue snake !
snake !
snakes !
but another line was crossed last night .
these guys deserve better than that .
phoenix , arizona has always stood by snakes !
and we always will !
two words : overpriced and understaffed .
just to clarify-not reviewing that particular dance night , just the establishment itself .
every time i have been , the bar has been understaffed .
two for an entire nightclub that is packed ?
how does that work ?
there 's also a back bar that seems to never be in use .
also ?
it 's almost as if this is a bare bones establishment .
place is awesome , bartenders real nice .
dj 's suck .
we need a better scene and better dj 's !
they charge a cover which is $ _num_ not bad .
the drinks are a bit expensive .
they have three dance floors .
overall it was cool .
we are fortune we are working with him .
we recommend him to anyone who has a need for a compassionate attorney .
i would highly recommend roger spencer for any of your commercial real estate needs .
rick freeman
i highly recommend him .
he was worth every penny we spent and more !
amy bertorelli
former president of kings ransom hotel and kings ransom inn
what can i say .
they are honest mechanics i know it is a rarity ! ! !
i have had my car served numerous times from them .
i would definitely recommend them to anyone who needs a repair .
good service , reasonable prices .
i took my truck in for a basic oil change .
the clerk was very nice and helpful .
i guess i should have seen this coming ?
i have never been charged to look at the car .
and certainly not $ _num_ for a ten minute inspection .
not a great way to build a relationship .
but be prepared to pay for it .
excellent service .
friendly staff .
being honest about the diagnosis of a car is only half the battle .
being honest about pricing is just as important .
and these guys totally failed .
retail for those parts ?
about $ _num_ .
hours it takes to swap them out ?
one , or two , at the most .
still not good enough .
oh , and the inspection we used a groupon for ?
tire rotation .
thanks matt !
keep up the great work .
i spent over $ _num_ on my car at this place since july .
why the _num_ stars ?
that 's effing class , folks .
i too had the groupon .
that being said this is why i give my _num_ stars to virginia auto .
being a single women is always a bit unverving taking my car in repairs .
well , me , my dad , auto zone and chiltons .
these guys are amazing !
i brought my car in and they checked over the whole car !
i realize my car needs some tlc .
i love the fact they told me everything that was wrong with my car .
!
( just joking but it was n't far off )
the owner matt allen is a champion .
i am not a happy customer - i 'm a fan .
i highly recommend this shop .
my car , unfortunately , had other plans .
we walked in and were helped right away .
my brand new battery was dead .
it had been completely drained !
not more than _num_ minutes later , they had finished !
thanks guys !
i was also pretty annoyed by the `` transfer '' of my trusted contact .
so , i started my search for a better option .
i went ahead and purchased the groupon after checking out the business on garagefly.com .
i ca n't sing higher praises of these guys .
my 30k mile versa had developed an idling problem .
they did a diagnostic and the problem was a misfire on cylinder _num_ .
as it turned out nissan had to replace my engine .
keep up the good work !
always glad to support local businesses !
: )
yes , virginia auto does good work .
yes , they offer great customer service .
no , it 's not worth paying double for .
p.s .
do yourself a favor and check out inman & sons instead .
: )
matt and tim were great .
how refreshing !
i fully recommend
i thought i had a problem with my car 's heater .
tim got it all arranged for me and explained everything as he always does .
i love these guys , they are smart , friendly and fair !
i 've been taking my car here since moving to phoenix a year ago .
three things really stand out about this shop :
_num_ .
everyone is professional and very nice .
that 's not a given at every auto shop .
_num_ .
many shops would just take the opportunity to do the service and charge you .
_num_ .
burgie will give you a ride back to your work/home !
before then i
its frustrating .
it is so hard to trust in these type of businesses especially when
you feel you are being taken advantage of .
since finding this shop , i hope they
never ever close their business doors , because i am a forever customer .
i will
drive whatever distance i have to drive to get my vehicle here in their most
capable hands .
their customer service is unsurpassed .
they provide transportation
to and from your work or home .
their workmanship is excellent .
they may not
you will `` you get what you pay for '' .
trust me ... ..this business will not disappoint !
they 're not the cheapest in town but they do high quality work .
they are clean , friendly , and helpful .
well , i have a little _num_ ford taurus .
and now , my little car has a great shop looking after her .
it had that tell-tale burning smell which was making me nervous .
virginia auto service changed my oil and cleaned up my engine .
did my oil change run a bit more than some $ _num_ special ?
yes , but it was so worth it !
now that is service !
the team here at virginia auto service is the best .
the price was fair and the service was done quickly .
we will be trusting only virginia auto service from now on .
we will be referring all our friends and customers here in the future .
have been taking my vehicles here for a few years since we moved downtown .
in the end , you do end up getting what you pay for .
i took my truck to get an oil change and inspection .
robert was super friendly and knowledgeable .
they did a great job and even picked me up from work .
overall , great mechanic !
mr. pascal adcock exemplifies the image that is virginia auto service .
their reputation definitely precedes themselves and pascal lives up to that image .
pascal reassured me of their commitment to top end auto repair and excellence .
i highly recommend them to anybody who has a vehicle .
these guys are dependably polite and make you feel at ease .
: )
definitely recommended !
these guys do a great job .
honest , hard working , competent , friendly .
i always passed by this place on my way to work .
recommended .
first time customer .
great service .
saved me a few hundred dollars .
accommodating with drop off to work with burgie .
and when a part could not be located in time provided a loaner car .
great customer service .
will be back .
i know a little something about cars .
my uncle has been a mechanic for over _num_ years .
i took my car to virginia auto service for a very specific issue .
they called me with a totally different problem the cost to fix was outrageous .
i repeated what i needed and they told me no , no , no .
i hope no one gets hurt because of virginia auto service
beware .
i lodged a complaint with the owner and requested a refund .
he laughed and said he would only communicate in writing with me .
he has only sent vague and threatening emails .
beware .
*updated*
original review :
`` my car died on a sunday .
i had aaa come out and do a diagnostic .
robert called me early in the morning and he was initially very friendly .
his quote was $ _num_ .
i called back and asked if $ _num_ was the best they could do .
i understand that all shops have different prices , but i am disappointed .
i wo n't be giving them my business . ''
update :
he was professional and courteous .
in yelp-speak , everything is a-ok , and i would recommend them to others .
my truck had been shuddering and shaking badly at certain rpms & speeds .
the dealer diagnosed the problem as my catalytic convertor and replaced it .
they also warranty their work , i believe it 's _num_ years/24,000 miles ?
chuck 's speed shop did my block work @ $ _num_ .
i 'm just not happy with the idle once the engine is at temp .
i had already changed the fuel filter .
wtf ? !
you can purchase the ford fuel pump for $ _num_ from rockauto.com !
i chose the carter for $ _num_ and they looked identical during the swap .
i used a new motorcraft temp gauge too .
virginia told me that they have never heard of `` carter '' .
i 'm not sure how much these guys know about anything .
their shop rate is $ _num_ .
seriously , does anyone do honest work anymore ?
!
to : matt a. , ( business owner )
i may not know everything , but i have honor and integrity .
yelps review process is totally rigged ... what a joke !
they only claim to be impartial .

amazing service and trustworthy , coming from someone who just moved to the valley .
would definitely recommend them ; ask for robert
took my car in as it needed its scheduled maintenance .
they called me and gave me an estimate of over $ 4,000 ? ? ?
seriously ?
i told them i wanted a second opinion .
i do not think they are honest and i definitely do not recommend them !
i could kiss this new friend .
luckily , though , i had a ride on the way .
in fact , they washed my car before giving it back to me ! !
who does that ?
these guys , apparently .
today i took my car in for an oil change ( period ) .
that is crazy ! !
i never asked them to do anything other than an oil change .
top notch customer service .
they walked me through what must happen and what could wait .
even dropped my car off for me !
i 've never experienced such excellent service from start to finish .
great auto shop !
i brought in my truck after another shop failed to fix an oil leak .
service was excellent , and communication was great .
i will now use these guys exclusively .
the wild thaiger is one of my new favorite places .
every dish i 've tried as been excellent .
the peanut sauce on the satay is amazing .
the beef curry was excellent .
the ginger fish dish less remarkable but still good .
coconut ice cream dessert is good for putting out the fire .
good place to go after an art or heard museum visit .
i actually like this place .
i find the mood to be nice and the lighting just right .
the food is well prepared and the alcoholic drinks are fantastic .
martinis !
my one complaint ... .they need to add some more vegetarian dishes .
anyways , it 's a great place for a date : )
oh wild thaiger , how i do love thee !
actually , to be more specific , how i do love pad thai .
you 'll dead end into a strip mall parking lot .
park there and walk a few steps south to wild thaiger .
viola !
yeah ... .
how sweet !
over-priced , over-crowded designer thai joint .
i really should go back and try it again .
especially with how bland the food is for a thai restaurant .
i prefer thai food that lights me up like a christmas tree .
i like this place .
although it gets really busy around noon .
my favorite dish is gapraogui .
the wild thaiger is the best kept thai restaurant secret on north central avenue .
my first culinary experience at thaiger was several months ago with co-workers .
my omnipresent dinner companion marcial and i , have been habitual customers since .
the restaurant atmosphere is very friendly and unpretentious .
the food is where the adventure begins .
do n't fret , you can always order more to go .
order hint : each plate is made to your specification .
she is the heart of the wild thaiger .
drive slow , this tiger is worth hunting in the concrete jungle .
my thai craving kicked in and i had to have some `` thingy . ''
it was packed inside for a weekday night , which is a good sign .
my tom yum soup and spicy basil chicken were right on the mark .
bland , blech , barf .
that 's pretty much how i feel about wild thaiger .
( you are on notice , wild thaiger ! )
i think i gave it a fair shake .
i was not impressed once .
no spice .
no life .
no business from me .
update 5/19/2008
finally .
me and the thaiger are purring like happy kittens .
i 've discovered their yellow curry at lunch and it is dee lish !
prices are insanely low , tho the lunch menu is limited .
service is upbeat and more polished .
now , a purrrrfect place for me to lunch ! ! !
hello kitty ! ! !
!
i think hello kitty is wildier than this cat .
veggie tempura .
i 've had crispier wafers from a priest .
pad thai .
i 've had tastier wafers from a priest .
i love the chef .
very approachable and like , totally , super nice .
i 've had more action from a priest .
i 'll go again .
try new things .
but only after i do the rosary .
had lunch here last year , i was presently surprised !
i am big on the yellow chicken curry - yum !
perhaps they are slipping , or more likely i am : )
the atmosphere is great .
i like everything from the tables and booths to the patio .
the service has always been top notch for me .
i love their pad thai .
a nice place does n't deserve that hassle .
after _num_ mos .
then i read some of the yelp reviews and almost changed my mind .
did the tempe pita jungle servers moonlight at wild thaiger ?
how can this place possibly be too-cool ?
grilled peanut chicken ?
sounds great .
spicy chicken curry , i 'll take it .
tiger prawn salad , ok. all for about $ _num_ ? ?
sounds pretty reasonable .
we had to search around for the hidden entrance .
perhaps because i was expecting it to be bad , i was pleasantly surprised .
it was pretty good .
all in all i would say it was a score .
the three of us agreed that it would make a good hh spot .
also a real winner were the spicy clear/glass noodles with vegetables and chicken .
they were appropriately strong and actually quite good !
all around , a really great experience .
i obliged .
i was blown away by the panang curry .
rich , thick , spicy .
we had it for take out and it survived the trip home fine .
while the presentation was very nice , the dish itself was just okay .
the one gal who got a noodle dish however said hers was terrific .
most of us got dessert to finish things off .
i got a slice of the mango cheesecake ( very tasty ) .
another person got the lemon ginger cheesecake and was very happy .
they also have drink specials on monday and wednesdays .
we went on wednesday for $ _num_ wine glass night .
i has a shiraz instead which was fine .
most everyone else got a white wine .
amazingly , when we originally sat down , the restaurant was just about dead .
but after 8:30pm the place was packed !
bottomline , good , but i 've had better .
the dragon eggs were atrocious .
but the pad thai and beef panang were both good .
not great , not mind blowing , but not horrible .
and for around $ _num_ each they were pretty good sized portions .
love this place for some decent thai !
its typically quiet which was perfect for girl 's day out and chatting .
service is unpredictable .
sometimes it is very good and sometimes it is very bad .
the pad thai here is delicious but has way too much chicken .
the kiew wan curry is very spicy and very good .
the spring rolls are also very tasty .
for dessert the coconut ice cream sprinkled with peanuts is a great ending .
it is open sundays which is rare downtown .
i had high hopes for this restaurant .
i got everything takeout .
i 'll start with the holy basil .
it was very good .
view , ca .
i expect delicate , tender meats at a high end thai place .
i opened my green curry and said : `` where 's the sauce '' ?
i am very upset at the lack of sauce .
there was so little i ca n't comment on the flavor of the curry .
the larger amercian green beans were n't cooked .
that sucked .
the beef was tender enough but the peices were too big .
there is something about eggplant in green curry ... .
the tom ka gai soup was fantastic .
does n't make sense to me .
this results in a fajita-style cut of chicken that leaves me less than thrilled .
recently went back with a party of _num_ for a bday celebration .
it was only downhill from there .
_num_ min to get drink orders , another _num_ to get the drinks .
another _num_ min later he took our food orders .
_num_ min later they started coming out , sort of .
seven entrees came out , staggered over a period of five minutes .
chicken underneath was completely flavorless and was dry and veggies were scant .
good thing it was only $ _num_ .
should have at least come out to explain/apologize for their issues .
do n't think i 'll go back to dine in - ever .
wild thaiger was never a great option for thai in the valley .
this is good . ''
bad choice .
we ordered the peanut chicken and it tasted more like peanut butter chicken .
of course the service is good , they never have anything better to do .
any other suggestions or should i give this place another chance ?
we sat outside on the covered patio , which was pretty busy .
our server was prompt and pleasant .
the food : i ordered chicken with peanut sauce and jasmine rice .
the sauce was very flavorful , but no heat at all .
now our server did not ask us about stars or heat at all .
maybe try another dish too .
phoenix yelpers- any other awesome thai places to try ?
?
i have had some good digestive experiences here .
i have only been here once , but what i ate was awesome !
i love that it 's right off the light rail too .
all in all a really great day .
good food , good people and a little culture .
got ta recommend all of it !
: )
the portions are large and they offer a wide variety of dishes .
they offer many asian beers and indochina-themed cocktails .
they have seating indoors and out with a patio view of central avenue .
the food is delicious and the drinks are really good .
the corn fritters are crunchy and good , served with jalapenos and cucumber .
the coconut milk-based soup with chicken was a hit around the table .
good drinks .
our server was first rate and unusually sweet .
went to wild thaiger for the first time last night and enjoyed every aspect .
had the wild wrap and dragon eggs for appetizers .
all were prepared very well .
it was by far the best panang we have in phoenix to date .
the beef was fork tender and the sauce flavor was over the top .
the restaurant is very cozy and energetic .
server was very friendly and attentive .
big bonus points for the kitchen design .
extremely rare to find in a thai concept .
love knowing who is cooking your food and that the kitchen is well kept .
flavorful dishes and martini mondays !
that makes me f-cking estatic !
i am happy to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow !
now , i 'm not an expert on thai cuisine .
i 'm not an expert on anything really .
but i know what i like .
in this instance , i like this place .
wild thaiger is located a few blocks north of the heard museum .
this was exactly what brought me there last night .
i was seated immediately upon arrival .
i was not disappointed .
the thai beer i had was wonderful .
unsurprisingly , much better than the standard american swill .
i decided on the jungle love ( insert 70s funk music here ) .
it was superb .
it added a great contrast to the mass of vegetables in the pot .
good , and spicy .
it was exquisite .
i went with two friends and we all enjoyed our meals .
great iced green tea !
rarrrrr !
that was my thought when i ate at wild thaiger .
my first visit was a few weeks ago and was for take out .
i decided on the chicken curry lunch special .
it was n't too spicy , just the right amount of kick for me .
and , it was very flavorful and extremely filling .
i definitely ca n't wait to have more rarrrr moments at wild thaiger !
been here twice .
loved it both times !
we beat him to this place .
now , we just need to pick a date for dinner .
i can not wait ! !
!
mmmmmmmmmmm !
lucky for us , with _num_ people , everyone picked something different .
i had the best beef panang evar !
i just wish it could hit them up on my lunch .
they even had my favorite desert , the mango and sticky rice .
we will definitely be going here again !
!
what a great little thai place in central phoenix .
great lunch specials mon-fri. ( not as great on the weekends . )
i prefer a bit spicier , maybe i should have asked for that .
i took a book , sat by myself and had a great afternoon .
prompt , friendly service .
lots of choices on the menu , lots of drink specials .
parking in the back , or take the light rail .
this is a great place .
good pad thai .
cold singha beer .
i order the same stuff every thai restaurant .
totally yummy food !
i love their appitizer veggie sampler , and their desserts are good too .
i recommend the thai custard .
great choice .
friendly service and modern decor .
the food was excellent .
phoenix is lucky to have this place .
i met someone here for dinner one night ...
they have the best pad see ue ( sp ? )
that i have ever tasted .
service was decent and the wait staff was very attentive .
everything was delicious .
it is worth it .
great food and generally good service .
green curry , mmmmmmmmmmm !
oh , gaprao gai , how i love thee .
nom .
able to relax and enjoy it !
had kimow chicken and must warn , it hot !
but i like my thai food hot ! !
and for dessert , omg !
had lemon ginger cheescake , was fantastic ! !
love this place and plan to return !
!
3/5/10
) , that i had to leave .
need i say more ?
that said , i must admit that the fried banana dessert was delicious !
the dish is perfect w/out them .
galee gai is the cure-all for allergies , the flu or a hangover .
trust me , i know hangovers .
the waitresses are all amazing and beautiful and nice .
) .
i have never had a bad meal or experience here .
i may be a tad bit biased about the wild thaiger .
the curries are absolutely amazing .
the pad thai is amazing , and the kimow is excruciatingly spicy and tasty .
but perhaps the most attractive aspect of the restaurant is the vegetarian-friendly menu .
i love the corn fritters ... mmmm
i love thaiger so i wanted to share the tastiness .
i figured i would write a review since i have not yet .
wild thaiger is in the heart of uptown phoenix .
central and thomas area .
cool little restaurant with a nice atmosphere inside .
food is great and very fresh .
they have nothing to hide .
prices are pretty standard at between 8.95-14.95 for dinner entrees .
great food and wonderful service .
nice change from other thai restaurants in tempe , chandler , mesa , etc .
i was surprised at how good this place was .
the food was honestly 4-star worthy , so tasty .
all the people ask for it .
it 's safer '' .
eek .
if you 're not gluten-free - for sure go here for thai !
it 's amazing .
if you are , just be very very careful !
our tastes are often a match .
once it arrived , i was pleased with the presentation .
to be fair it was n't horrible ... but i certainly have had better .
the waitress could have been quite a bit more attentive .
something just seemed a little off about her ?
we started the meal off with the corn fritters .
they were crispy and delicious and had a yummy cucumber chutney with them .
for my entree , i had the tofu mangone and it was awesome .
we finished the meal with the blueberry kaffir lime cheesecake .
it was creamy , cool , and a wonderful way to end a meal .
i 'm so happy to have found a good thai place !
i went for lunch this time and the service was great .
although it was slightly loud , the food more than made up for it .
started out with lettuce wraps and ended with pad thai .
it was amazing !
very tasty : )
i used to go here once every two weeks for lunch with my coworkers .
ambiance = extrememly fun .
hot sauce and peppers = extrememly available .
the drinks here are highly recommended .
lychee + gin martinis .
yes yes yes yes yes .
i 'm not sure why i havent started making this at home .
i had my union going away party here on the patio .
so awesome in the fall and winter !
oh also the staff is awesome .
i am hopping mad .
ordered take out at 7:15 and was told to give them _num_ minutes .
what ?
you ca n't take care of takeout and dining customers ?
what ?
this is outrageous .
they did n't even offer an apology or some sort of concession .
acted like it was normal ! ! !
wild thaiger is off my list forever .
customer service at it 's worst !
deciding on wild thaiger , i chose to save thai hut for another time .
they offer ample parking behind the restaurant and patio dining if you so choose .
thai iced tea in hand i reviewed the menu .
the jasmine rice was cooked perfectly .
or maybe i will try thai hut .
food was alright .
service was the worst i have ever experienced .
i took almost two hours for us to receive our food .
i have n't and will not go back .
thai hut is much better/cheaper/better service !
!
the sauce is savory , spicy , sweet , and rich .
the salmon pairs quite well with panang sauce , as do the tender scallops .
the veggie spring rolls here are okay , but not amazing .
the thai iced tea is standard , which is good .
the tom yum ( or was it tom kah ? )
i 've never had bad service here , and i come all the time .
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it .
the lady on the phone said it was not an issue .
we got there and it was packed on a friday night .
the hostess said it would be _num_ minutes for a table .
literally two seconds later , there was a four person table cleared .
i asked for the table and she got someone to clean it for us .
the place was busy and noisy .
the menu was limited and average priced for most items .
i craved noodles so ordered the pad-seiw .
the noodles were alright .
the hubby had the bbq chicken with coconut rice .
so sadly we will not be returning .
thai rama has much better food and service .
all in all super yummy , will def be back .
oh and you have to try the thai iced tea .
its mental how good it is .
enjoy !
great food and service
i have n't been in a while but i remember being impressed .
nice ambiance , especially for a thai restaurant .
finally got to eat at this place after driving by so many times .
very impressed , will definitely be going back .
it was fine .
a fine thai meal to have before a rock show downtown .
wild thaiger was very cozy and inviting .
the server took another _num_ minutes to take our drink order .
the thai iced tea was really different but very good .
our main dishes took forever to come out and it was just ok .
i think i like thai food.but i will not be returning here .
this place is really our favorite thai restaurant in phoenix area by far .
i have not had any veggie pad thai that is better anywhere else !
the price was also reasonable .
we ordered takeout , and were n't too adventures .
i ordered the beef panang and husband ordered a peanut chicken dish .
definitely do not order the spicy dishes if you ca n't take the heat .
great patio too .
very mediocre .
check out the places i mention above .
it 's an adventure .
yum to the freakin ' yum .
also , i love the pun in the name .
there , i said it .
it 's an eastern thing , dude .
also amazing : the female wait staff .
just go .
you 'll see what i mean .
yeah .
incredible .
anyway , a good place to remember on north central .
it happened at wild thaiger .
big portions .
highly recommended !
i usually order the yellow curry with chicken .
lunch hour is very busy so you might get stuck waiting for your server .
went on my birthday after st. francis had an hour long wait .
very happy with our decision .
had the ginger martini .
very sweet , but very good .
then , we shared the vegetarian appetizer plate .
the corn fritters are mind blowing good !
never had anything like that before .
i had the tofu pad thai , which was perfect !
great heat and flavor .
bathrooms were clean and nicely decorated .
will go back again for sure !
i can only say that it was amazing !
i am a fan , and the service was really great .
i recommend trying this place if you like authentic thai food .
i will definitely be going back .
i had a surprising lunch at the thaiger .
then nothing .
maybe it was our fault as we chose outside on a cloudy cool day .
after no response , i went in ordered food .
food was delivered _num_ minutes later .
then adding insult to injury the food was bland when it arrived .
why ask about spice levels ?
another trip to the bar for some peppers .
not worth the time or money solid _num_ stars .
mike
i had the strawberry champagne martini it was very well made .
i will continue to go back as long as they are opened .
you wo n't be disappointed .
we 've eaten here about _num_ times now , and we are always delighted .
the beef panang is just killer .
the strips of beef are incredibly tender and of high quality .
the sauce , ohhhhhh the sauce .
personally , my favorite is the yellow curry .
yellow curry is my dish .
it 's absolutely the best here .
the steamed vegetables are so tender that they fall apart .
the little relish on the side is shockingly delicious and refreshing .
the duck sauce that comes with the fried rolls makes them worthwhile .
i know there 's something with peanut sauce ( satay ? )
that makes me happy .
appetizers and desserts are up to you .
if you like cellophane wrapped veggie rolls , they 're great here .
if you like coconut ice cream , do it .
it 's definitely thai ... but upgraded .
in my opinion , it 's perfect .
mediocre thai food .
nothing bad but nothing special .
it was mostly broth with few veggies .
the pad thai was decent .
the green papaya salad was bland needing more lime juice .
we ordered everything medium spice and it came out with no heat .
disappointing experience .
we came only due to the four star rating .
the cheesy _num_ 's radio station did n't help .
not sure if i 'll be back .
thai food is my new favorite .
i was really excited to try this place with my husband on saturday .
i really enjoyed the opportunity to eat outside on such a beautiful day .
the service was pretty bad .
we had to ask for ice tea refills .
we had to ask for additional sweetner packets .
no rice at a thai restaurant ? ! ? !
how do you run out of something so basic ? ?
?
my husband ordered the wild boar .
he thought it was just okay .
i had the eggplant and tofu .
i asked them to add some thai pumpkin to it .
it was super yummy .
the bill was a bit expensive and i wo n't be running back .
it took us over an hour to get our lunch ! !
!
now i like that in a place !
it came and was fantastic and most suprisingly light .
i ordered as a main the seafood panang and it was so good .
none of it remained .
my friend ordrered the mango shrimp and ate every bite of that .
just delicious !
so this place is legit , good service and good food .
i would if i could give it _num_ stars .
called in another order earlier this week .
it was ready when i got there .
as always , the food was amazing .
they cook it perfectly .
just awesome .
come onnnnn !
just throw one in the bag .
i wo n't tell !
_num_ or maybe _num_
finally got to try wild thaiger .
what an awesome meal .
what a great way to open up the meal .
every other part was perfect .
wow .
triple decker and all .
wow , just realized my reviews were never finished ...
so , this is from a year ago at thanksgiving .
have n't been back , but would definitely try it again .
*************
i 'm happy to say it did n't disappoint !
we had appetizers as well as dinner , and everything was sooooooooo tasty !
the presentation was pleasing , the portions outrageously large , and the service exceptional .
still , it was a great experience .
we 'll definitely be back !
i 'm in love with their pad thai !
needless to say , i was excited !
alas , at the arrival of my food , i was disappointed .
inside looked clean and the booths are rather private , which is neat .
my biggest complaint was the layout of the menu itself .
like i said , it 'll satisfy , but it pretty mediocre .
tried this place last night ... its very good location with a nice patio .
the food was fresh and was good .
food not that favorable .
i think i will be sticking with chinese and japanese .
we had our first experience on a friday night about 6:30 .
the servers were pleasant .
the inside was clean with a combo bar and open kitchen .
we started with the freshie rolls with warm peanut sauce and lychee martini .
the entrees are huge and could easily be shared .
glad we tried it .
no no nooodles ... ..wonderful..my new favorite..
this is the noodle-less pad thai , it is low carb but very tasty .
by the way , the regular pad thai is also wonderful .
i have always had great service and i have loved every dish i tried .
heaven .
i work around the corner so come here once a month or so .
they 're soups are fantastic and so is their iced tea !
the staff here seems to resent it when thais come in .
my wife is thai .
as soon as she entered she was met by a thai staff member .
she asked a question about a menu item .
the responce was simply nasty & for no reason .
we told our friends we had taken there we wouldnt stay & we left .
we will never return .
read gary cs review before you waste money here .
