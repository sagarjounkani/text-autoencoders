husband loves the thin crust pizza .
breadsticks are great too monicals pizza is by far one of my favorite pizzas .
it has two levels which gives is a more homey feeeling .
absolutely love their thin crust pizzas .
have n't found one as crispy anywhere else .
the pizza is just ok .
the appetizers are frozen and low quality .
service is always slow and they constantly forget basic things like straws .
the family environment is nice for kids or big groups .
i 've ate here many times after # illini football games .
service is great & fast .
accept credit .
i suggest the family meal .
i am glad we did .
i suggest the chow fun .
it 's very good and not too greasy ... cheap and perfectly adequate .
the kind of place you order from because it 's close and cheap .
the food here is n't great but it is n't bad either .
among the cheaper options though , this is about par .
i really think this is some of the best chinese food in champaign .
i love this place for take out chinese .
when i get other things i am happy with the food .
every time i order it comes exactly as expected and exceeds taste wise .
the fried dumplings are a must if you ever visit this place .
i order for pick up and it 's always ready right on time .
food is actually pretty delicious .
price is okay , but the amount that they give you is amazing .
definitely worth going for if you want good quick chinese food the biggest serving of crab rangoon my lonely eyes have ever seen .
; d we just are n't too adventurous , so .
teej is from southern california .
teej is afraid of the cold .
teej is in desperate need of winter clothes .
teej also speaks in third person .
`` where are you from !
`` i 'm from the south bay . ''
definitely check out champaign surplus .
they rule !
i am a comparison shopper .
i check prices , models and when i spend my money i spend deliberately .
i also try to buy locally .
i can get them instantly and try them on !
this is why we should all shop locally .
its better than wildcountry , but those are really two different stores .
do n't miss their sidewalk sale !
kudos to ira and co champaign surplus is a great store .
this is the better of the two local outdoor/outfitter stores in town .
in the back is their army-surplus store .
the sale is a great place to get gloves/mittens/hats , too .
this is for sure the best place to go for your outdoor/winter clothes needs .
they have a nice selection of stuff and the prices seem just about right .
their camping and sporting stuff is pretty aweosme too .
( wtf ) so that makes the price difference more palatable , especially if you need help .
this is a nice store : lots of great brands and selection .
prices reflect the good brands -- do n't expect a bargain .
they have some , but very limited in type and variety .
the focus here is on clothing .
an institution , but has come so far since i was a kid .
they 're now a mini rei , both in size/selection and quality .
prices too , really , but i 'm used to inflated prices .
good quality and good service once you find someone to help .
for our area this is a good military surplus store .
they carry abig line of domestic & international military clothing & gear .
they also carry fort knox & alpha jackets and coats .
on the internet there are no blank stares ... this store is always well-stocked and well-staffed .
this store is dangerous for people who like camping gadgets .
i am one of those people .
sometimes if you 're just shopping during a sale , they can be annoying .
do n't forget to check the back room for the best deals !
also , do n't come here expecting actual military surplus .
they charge extra for bags so do n't forget to bring your own !
i 've been shopping at champaign surplus since _ num _ .
that said , there are some excellent ones too .
this place has a fun dance atmosphere .
i remember driving to champaign from kankakee to go to `` c street '' .
when it is warm , you can hang out on the patio as well .
c street is where the boys are in champaign .
they also have free popcorn .
this bar is pure vintage .
chester street is where my club life began .
the dance floor is massive with a giant mirror in the back .
c/u is a fun town period .
this bar is what you make out of it .
music is fun and meeting people there is memorable .
drag show is recommendable .
parking is close and fairly big .
bathrooms are not good , and the cover is a bummer .
floor / counter tops can be sloshing with alcoholic liquid though ... this is usually the last stop of the night whenever i go out .
hands down this place has the best hot nachos in the city !
tanning bed _ num _ .
flirty blue hawaii they play the best edm in the champaign .
parking is relatively easy .
there 's always parking in the rear .
what is this magical place you call c street ?
c street has the best dj 's and dance floor on/near campus .
it 's usually fine .
the bartender , andrew is a bit chatty but nice .
today i go in the bf is tending bar .
decides he is gon na be a jerk ; no manners .
i leave .
the drag shows are awesome and the music is usually great for dancing .
the drinks are good , and the beer selection is okay .
overall it 's a cool place with a great vibe .
i know how this is supposed to work !
the bar is full and the drinks are strong .
the music is loud and the people are ... well .
but that 's just me .
remodel the bathrooms .
keep on gettin it with the drag shows .
i 'm a fan of the drag shows every sunday night .
yo floors sticky additionally , modern bars are offering more than two draught selections .
overall , i 'm extremely happy !
i 've been going to dr. albert 's office for the last few years .
i am always extremely impressed by the thoroughness and efficiency of her exams .
she is very friendly , helpful , and open to any questions .
all of my appointments have lasted around 30-40 minutes .
i really appreciate doctors who respect my time !
i 'm surprised there are n't more reviews of dr. albert here .
they are great at helping to find a flattering and fashionable pair of glasses .
i love this place !
they have a good selection of frames incl .
dr. albert is great too and provides very thorough exams .
highly recommend .
what really brings me back , though , is the great staff there .
she 'll just bring me several frames , and then the fun begins .
i have really appreciated that .
for such a small shop , they can be busy .
for an eye exam , of course you need an appointment .
but for adjustments , you can ` walk in . ''
they are definitely work the wait !
dr jodi is a really nice optometrist .
i 'm not sure if that was on purpose or by accident ... i am in cu for graduate school and needed new glasses and an exam .
i have to say that i was impressed .
i am always surprised that they generate enough income to pay the rent .
but here 's my beef ... it has gotten to the point that i hate to go into the store .
to which i answered `` do n't worry about it . ''
please shut the f *** up and leave me the f *** alone .
same old , same old ... verbally assaulted by 20-something clerk ... no , i do not need your assistance .
no , i do not want to discuss my weekend plans with you .
no , i do n't care anything about you or your life .
this is my go-to hardware store .
i can get in and out in a short amount of time .
what really sets this store apart from other hardware stores is their employees .
they have quality items and are always happy to help .
that said , i always find what i need .
they have expanded a little with garden tool rentals .
their prices are not far off the big box stores .
this is almost worth a trip to champaign .
so well stocked , i 've never seen a better collection .
this is my go-to hardware store .
the employees are very helpful and knowledgeable .
there is a huge difference between shopping here and somewhere like menards/lowes .
they provide a _ num _ % discount if you show your icard !
and i think that says something ... love this place !
i love rebecca !
i love amy !
i love lindsey !
i love jake !
the whole staff is rad and i 'll never go anywhere else .
i 'm not suburban-bland , but i 'm not a hipster either .
so best of luck to them , but i 've decamped .
it 's champaign-urbana for crissakes -- do we have to be so pretentious ?
step in : abby from ippatsu .
thank you , abby !
i have one the best haircuts ever !
i just love it !
plus a bonus is that shes so sweet !
they are the best place to get a haircut , color , etc .
everyone who works there is very sweet and genuine too !
i 'm gon na miss this place so much when i move : ( but maybe i 'm pretty easy going so that 's just my preference .
but i think that 's just how he is .
i think she 's the owner 's dog .
the staff seems pretty young ( most under _ num _ ? )
and yes , roxie , the chihuahua , is adorable !
my only quibble is the cost .
i 'll probably go here again next time i feel like splurging though .
i have never felt so comfortable with someone cutting my hair !
( though i know their other stylists are awesome as well ! )
if you 're looking for a new salon , go to ippatsu .
i loooove the place .
i see kate when i go there , and she does really stylish haircuts .
i myself am very indecisive about what to do with my hair .
the place has not match in cu .
i am a far cry from being scene .
i do n't think it exists in champaign .
service : ippatsu has young staff who like to express themselves .
i wish she were more gentle with her hands .
jake is great !
i have curly hair that i wear both curly and straight .
i definitely recommend him to people of all hair types .
he also has some kind of certification in cutting curly hair .
ippatsu is as close as i 've found to that experience .
she also does a great cut and style .
i have major cow licks and i come out with poker straight hair .
i 've been so impressed i 'm using ippatsu for my wedding !
rebecca is the stuff dreams are made of .
many people complain that the environment and staff in ippatsu seem pretentious .
ok , i can take partial responsibility for being late , but _ num _ minutes ?
i 've had difficulty finding someone who could cut long curly hair .
i 've learned cutting curly hair dry is almost always a disaster .
quit being cheap people and get a good hair cut !
and of course , doug is awesome .
the deva curl one condition is amazing .
wherever doug is , that 's where i 'll go .
plus , it 's right downtown next to some tasty cafes and bakeries .
doug is my hero !
i look forward to our visits - very fun & relaxed .
plus , the price is incredibly reasonable for such a high-quality cut !
he has earned my highest recommendation !
avoid at all costs !
the results are subtle , just what i wanted .
i love how unique , artsy , and friendly they are .
do n't forget that they 've moved to their new location on chester !
jake is super nice and approachable as other reviews mentioned .
my hair looks great , has nice volume and frames my face better .
most importantly , it works with and accentuates my naturally curly hair .
if you have curly hair , i absolutely recommend the devacut .
if you can get it with jake at ippatsu even better .
it 's seriously one of the best hair cuts i have ever had .
i hate to spend money -- especially on haircuts .
i believe the extra expense if worth every penny .
i love getting my hair cut here !
jamie marlow is the world 's best hairstylist .
there is no one i would rather go to .
she does exactly what you want and works with you and your hair .
she makes it work .
jamie listens , cares , and is just the best .
i 've never had better hair .
rebecca is an outstanding owner and artist .
kate , my stylist , is simply outstanding .
i can not say enough about how great my experience was here .
jake is great for a number of reasons . )
also , tis place is absolutely not at all whatsoever overpriced .
i love my new hair cut !
the salon has an overall trendy vibe .
if you need a curly cut , see jake !
he 's a master in his field !
yes , it 's pricey but it 's well worth it !
does it get any better than that ?
it does n't .
oh , and ( most importantly ) they 're good at what they do .
the environment is inviting and friendly .
i recommend this salon .
he is fairly easy-going and caring your thoughts and concerns .
thanks jake to make my hair survive = ) jake jake jake !
i love this salon .
amy is fabulous !
go see her .
this salon is a great vibe , chill and relaxed .
overall fantastic experience and i highly advise anyone to go b i asked for a basic color service and the stylist burned my scalp .
go elsewhere !
i know no one reviews mcdonalds , but this drive through is seriously awesome .
ok so we all know that mcdonalds is awesome .
there 's nothing i can complain about .
mcdonalds is generally mcdonalds .
the food here is fine , but service/atmosphere is lacking .
also , they have very strict bbq sauce quotas .
it 's mcdonald 's .
service can range time to time , but that 's expected with fast food .
i only use the drive through at this mcdonalds .
_ num _ of the last _ num _ times i 've been the order has been wrong .
i 'm guessing they ca n't leave after work stars and neither can i .
it 's not much different from most other mcdonald 's .
customer service is average .
the service is horrendous .
went there numerous times and my orders have been messed up .
how do i hate thee ?
let me count the ways .
i hate this mcdonalds .
i 'm not exaggerating .
i 'm dead serious .
after i finished the meal , thank goodness for mcdonalds .
this is why america is awesome .
the playground smells horrible .
the worst quality mcdonald i have been to .
my mcchicken only comes with one slice of bun ... ... ... the other side is missing .
this is a terrible place for anybody looking to enjoy themselves .
if having fun is not your thing , check out fat city .
inside , the place does n't * look * that bad .
the worst i 've experienced in champaign-urbana .
the music system sucks . )
the food sucks .
on tuesday , they have $ _ num _ margaritas that are terrible . )
they have $ _ num _ domestic beers on wednesday night .
this place has been through several owners ( one being my cousins ) .
a beer garden that has hosted plenty of bands .
i have never seen such colossal unprofessionalism .
good to see .
did n't see any old lady maybe that 's why .
will never go unless iam stuck in the mall and hungry when i go to a restaurant during prime time i expect results .
this is my usual lunch spot when i am out shopping with my family .
it is very popular and the line is usually quite long .
given that the food is already prepared , does n't make much sense .
thanks , g-mart , for being the best comics shop in town .
there 's a good selection of comics here , including some small press titles .
oh , and i love their pre-ordering system .
i love diving into quarter bins and g-mart has some of the best .
every time i head back down to champaign , i stop by g-mart .
so , let me get this straight -- i love comics .
i have missed this .
you have to search a little bit to find it these days .
they 're on-hand stock is a bit underwhelming overall .
but i 'm not sure cu could support such a store .
this is probably one of the best places to order comics .
my favorite comic book stores usually have some kind of back-issue collection .
fortunately , no one has ever entered g-mart when goldfrapp is not playing .
alright , seriously though , colby makes the store .
_ num _ stars ... i do n't have the heart to give it _ num _ .
i feel kind of bad hatin ' on g-mart .
then you actually enter the comic book shop .
it 's ... a lot smaller than i was expecting .
also quite a few boxes of back-issues , which are always fun to browse .
one of my favorite things about going to a comic book shop is browsing .
i know this is somewhat frowned upon .
do n't read the comics and all that jazz .
or buy it directly from fantagraphics .
why is it almost totally empty ?
i guess i just do n't understand why the space seems so poorly utilized .
but there is n't .
street signage and visibility is zero .
kids are excited to read their comics .
it 's a shame this business has gotten a few poor reviews .
please support our local businesses before going online .
it is a value added service and a benefit to our local community .
whenever my boyfriend and i are in the area , we always stop in .
apparently , this place has the best prices on guitar strings - whoodathunk !
i 'm no musician , but i 've had nothing but great experiences here .
get your hot pot supplies here !
i believe that they typically get their shipments in on fridays .
sometimes they even have random seafood products like littleneck clams or blue crab .
bizarre fruits , strange flavors , and interesting ingredients are abundant .
i do n't think they like white people .
they have good , cheap produce and lots of imported canned and boxed food .
i get the feeling that they may not .
to summarize : pros : lots of variety , relatively inexpensive cons : dirty , can be difficult to locate what you 're looking for this is the asians ' asian grocery store .
update : the reviews on here are for the far east grocery store .
far east grocery has a huge variety for such a little place .
as long as you are respectful to them not obnoxious .
some other customers have accused the store of being `` dirty . ''
sometimes they even have a box of live crabs available for adventurous eaters !
i describe this place to my friends as a concrete box with a door .
`` where ... where am i ?
you 're in asia , my friend .
prices are reasonable but its a pain that they only accept cash or check .
they offer very fresh seafood .
they take both checks and cash but do not accept credit . )
but this spot does ok .
cash only , do n't forget !
this has got to be my favorite grocery store for asian goods .
you also get a waft of that chinese grocery store smell .
the selection of fish is pretty good .
there are many kinds of whole fish and filets .
but the best thing of all are the owners .
they are extremely nice and helpful .
they also give good recipes and recommendations .
it 's really cozy and i feel so invited every time .
i wish i could take the store with me .
far east is very close to my sister 's apartment .
are you sure this is a safe street ? ''
well , mom knows her stuff .
yes , it 's creepy from the outside .
yes , it 's a little weird smelling when you first walk in .
but the produce and authentic asian things are spot on .
that 's how good it was .
they also have all of the condiments your at-home-asian-cooking-heart desires .
let 's not even start on the candy .
i die .
cash only so be prepared for that .
i wish i lived in between far east and world harvest !
great place to get asian food !
i cant .
my family `` lovingly '' refers to this place as the crack house .
i refer to it disgustedly as the crack house .
i just dont trust this place .
let me repeat that ... they have seafood .
they only accept cash , probably because they make up prices as they go .
does n't accept cards .
can be inconvenient .
really do n't recommend to shop in this store .
lots of foods are expired and still on the shelf for sale .
so yeah , it 's totally fine .
do n't let these crackers confuse you .
it has a nice asian stank in there .
they have a ton of cool sweets too .
the products in this place are reasonably priced .
that 's not the reason why i 'm giving far east _ num _ stars .
i 'm not sure what is going on with that .
but that 's just for personal consumption .
there 's got to be something banning this sort of thing .
even if there is n't , this is an unsavory practice as a business .
who knows how long the meat has been left out .
far east , you 're worrying me .
you get to keep a star for your shelf items .
check those expiration dates though .
going back tomorrow with my husband .
lots of stuff to choose from here .
great place to get a variety of fresh authentic asian groceries .
various kinds of food can satisfy my needs but the quality .
can not imagine the poor quality of some food .
far east has a lot of chinese/asian grocery items .
i think they mostly emphasize chinese ethnic food .
the aisles are really narrow !
if you 're claustrophobic , you 've been warned !
hey , at least it 's way better than the target !
there are some nice high end items that can be bought with good sales .
hidden deals : never anyone around to help .
easier to use amazon.com .
how times have changed .
nonetheless , i have a fat face .
pro tip : shop the return section !
they can be busy at times .
do yourself a favor and go in the evening on a weekday .
he is professional , courteous and knowledgable on lenscrafters eyewear .
the doctor side of lenscrafters gets _ num _ stars .
i 've found the retail side of lenscrafters to be a complete rip off .
ever wonder why glasses are ungodly expensive here ?
i have gone to lense crafters several times .
i have always been happy with their service until recently .
prices are high but you can find anything .
anything you can think of , at a reasonable price .
they do n't price match .
you sell the best toys.you are aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawssomeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee .
if you want the blu-ray ... .
forget it , that 's in another part of the store .
`` you have a coupon to buy `` peter pan '' ?
`` you have a coupon on your phone ?
`` target and walmart are selling `` little mermaid '' for a lower price ?
well ma'am , you have to bring the ad in to us '' `` you have the ad on your phone ?
get control of your registry people champaign toys r us !
they make a mean calzone as well .
i 'm a little sad that they do n't use fresh mushrooms .
dude , this pizza is gross .
crust takes almost exactly like cardboard and the toppings are icky .
and walking .
and walking .
it 's a long way to east urbana from downtown champaign .
forget the pizza here .
just forget it .
it 's not nearly as good as garcia 's or papa del 's .
in fact it 's not even better than papa john 's .
they have fabulous calzones here .
they just ooze delicious cheese and are stuffed with toppings .
this is really , really good pizza , particularly for the price .
okay , so they use canned ( or jarred ) mushrooms .
the cheese is delicious ( also had the cheesy bread ) .
revising my earlier review .
and hard to recognize what i received as a stuffed pizza .
all the other reviewers seem to be rich , snobs .
it is delivery or pick-up only ... .
you do n't go there for aesthetics .
this is the kind of mom & pop pizzeria pizza i grew up with .
pan is the way to go , skip the stuffed .
i ordered a sausage and pepperoni pizza pizza is not anything to write home about , that is for sure .
the poorboys are also good , but i really ca n't recommend the pizza .
they are lucky they have my favorite calzones in town .
this place is definitely worth stopping into if you 're a gamer .
chambananites , this is a local business that deserves to stay in-town .
so i can not testify for the other rpg or game types they have .
it is not to say that i have been tempted though .
everytime i come , i can not help but peruse what they have .
the staff is friendly and helpful .
i can not say enough about the staff at this facility .
my story begins with picking my cat up at the groomer 's .
have faith your pet is in good hands here .
why wo n't yelp let me give zero stars ?
the animal emergency clinic of champaign is a scam .
they charge exorbitant fees and do a very poor job .
i think anyone affiliated with the aec should be ashamed of themselves .
overcharging and taking advantage of people in desperate situations is inexcusable .
i am glad i have pet insurance !
but it is a blessing that they are there when you need them !
very caring and thorough care during a stressful time !
is n't that what i asked !
i ca n't say enough about my vet , she is awesome and thorough .
as for animal emergency clinic , they are boobery and nothing more .
humans do n't even get charged this much for simple iv therapy !
this place is a joke to the highest magnitude !
circles has saved me on more than one occasion .
she also has her own clothing line which is worth checking out .
jennifer north is way better .
how can you not love comfort and sleekness all in one ?
ps : they are now on neil st , next to pekara .
it 's uncalled for , and it 's stupid .
i do n't get it .
it 's demeaning and unnecessary .
it 's not worth the visit .
bella is more professional .
i totally agree with jade .
circles is a great place to find that one-of-a-kind piece .
definitely try it out if you have n't been before !
i love this store .
it stands alone here .
you 're better than that , girl .
literally , she spends a bar of gold on clothes for me at circles .
that 's how i sleep at night .
in my skunkfunk fancies .
now , super _ num _ is ... a super _ num _ .
`` um , yeah , can you febreeze it ? ''
the one additional star is for the free wireless in the room .
i 'm so sorry , pops .
there is even a nicer super _ num _ near lincoln avenue .
i do not know what else you could possibly be looking for in champaign .
i have stayed here twice now !
honestly , do n't stay here unless every other hotel is booked .
do not stay here !
thank .
i do n't need fancy , i just need comfy .
this should tell you it is not ok to stay there !
classic case of getting what you pay for .
i 've heard of the saying `` beauty is pain '' - but sheesh !
get some fresh air flowing in here !
overall , it 's not awkward .
kane & company is a little pricey for this town .
i always get a great cut and color from erica .
she is a great stylist !
erica has been cutting my hair for a few years .
you can imagine what that felt like .
i 've been a client of paul kane for over a decade .
the salon has a friendly feel and a good vibe .
first of all , i love the calm atmosphere in the salon .
and i really think i found her .
a cut costs $ _ num _ but is worth every penny .
i highly highly recommend her !
he 's brilliant .
the end result is a fantastic edgy cut that is completely wash and go .
con : mega expensive i have been following my girl ursa all around the town .
she is just the best and she is sooooo cute .
ps : i am a straight female : ) ursa rocks !
her work is top notch .
she is friendly and does n't rush through your appointment .
alex is also great at doing makeup .
ursa is simply the best .
i 've been getting my haircut by terra for the past _ num _ years .
she has given me cuts that were more conservative and some more edgy .
terra simply knows exactly how to bring my hair from blah to amazing .
also kane and company is top notch .
the staff is super friendly and its easy to make appointments .
the salon staff are really friendly , and ursa is great !
the interior is nice and it 's in a beautiful old building .
so i have to say ursa always delivers .
they do n't care about anything except for your money .
everyone is so nice and the place is clean and organized .
i see carly to get my hair cut and she does an awesome job .
i 'm very pleased with the service and the cut .
definitely better than what 's currently available at ippatsu , at least .
i find her cuts to always be contemporary and flattering .
she has a good eye for style and good technical skills .
i am happy to have her as my stylist .
( i also have gone to alex who is top notch too ) .
i find her a delightful person to chat with too .
kane and co offers a pleasant , clean and bright setting .
i like that they remind me the day before an appointment .
i hope this makes the cut .
i plan on scheduling myself an appointment i 'll review that one also !
the atmosphere is great , and very trendy .
they have water , teas , coffee to drink while getting a cut .
from receptionist to stylists , kane and co is professional and friendly .
ursa is a rock star .
it does not hurt that she is very cute too : ) they are awesome .
this is th best barber shop i found in town .
i like my hair style .
definitely recommend this .
i 've been going here for _ num _ years !
everywhere i go i always get compliments !
her personality and charisma make the visit so much fun and they look awesome !
we highly recommend kane & co. !
for reference , i 'm an asian male with relatively thick hair .
first , it 's very pricy .
it 's not worth the price .
i have tried twice .
she 's amazing with coloring and cutting my hair exactly how i want .
i highly recommend her !
they are all so friendly and helpful !
it looks almost exactly like the picture i brought in .
it 's always a good experience for me !
danielle can really handle any skin concerns and is super generous with her insights .
and , my previous review still totally stands !
most of the staff is very friendly and easy to talk to .
i love coming in here .
the only downside is the pricing .
i read one of the reviews which recommended lauren .
i see danielle for my eyebrows and she is amazing !
i highly recommend her .
the salon is really nice , reasonable prices , and my highlights/cut look perfect !
thank you !
michelle benjamin-remember that name , write it down if you have to !
michelle is an esthetician and she is levels more than that .
my skin is glowing and looks better than it has since my youth .
i love love love melissa cave .
and there 's wine too .
i like that .
danielle ( esthetics/skin care ) at kane and company is amazing .
l-o-v-e this place !
thank you melissa !
the proprietor can be a bit brusque , but not rude .
she has been doing repairs for me for years .
she is excellent and fair priced .
in conclusion - yes for barbara if you need something taken in .
they know what they are doing , and that is the most important thing .
her work is consistent , timely , and a bargain .
barbara is great for the small fix as well as the bigger projects .
she has hit the nail on the head _ num _ times .
i do n't understand people commenting on her attitude .
i 've been to almost every one in champaign/urbana and many in chicago .
parking is a little tough sometimes , but that 's normal for the town .
it 's small too , so sometimes you ca n't find a seat .
in true caf style , the art on the walls is always changing .
this is cu 's top-notch coffee shop .
they have delicious hot and cold drinks and wonderfully fresh pastries .
and a diverse enough menu to provide sustenance .
here is what i love at kopi : the staff the vibe the cucumber , roasted red pepper , goat cheese sandwich the green salad the grilled cheese with tomatoes the princess cookies the earl grey tea the cucumber water the doorway to circles cafe kopi is one of the better cafs in town .
i find their coffee to be robust without being bitter .
their chai is some of the best in town .
that is not so tasty to me .
great coffee , plus you can get port and some other boozy drinks .
ok so the chairs are uncomfortable after a while , that 's true .
no couches to encourage settling in for the long haul .
the ambiance is great , and sitting outside people-watching on walnut is wonderful .
alright ... cafe kopi deserves its full _ num _ stars .
the coffee at kopi is wicked good .
a thousand times better at night when it 's brightly lit .
afternoons are gross .
and right over the air conditioning vent .
and they wear gloves when they make your sandwhiches .
i suppose it 's worth it ) .
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ okay , not all tables and chairs are created equal .
to visit and chat - no problem .
but still , great coffee , music , and good place to go .
i still definitely recommend .
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ and i still love their turkey panini !
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ i prefer their house coffee to their `` coffee of the day '' .
i admit the coffee here is stellar .
however , the ambience is all wrong .
you 're growing on me , kopi .
night times are great to study here , or cold rainy days .
also , the tuna bacon melt is the greatest thing in the universe .
i know .
great atmosphere with regulars and they do n't mind if you camp out .
kopi is ... meh .
i go here a lot because i live nearby .
let 's take one example : the flies in the pastry case .
they act like flies are an insurmountable puzzle never before encountered by anyone else .
try a flyswatter .
or a trap that does n't use insecticide ( like the sticky ones ) .
or buy a larger insect zapper .
i still go there because there are n't that many nearby cafes .
the staff are very nice and the curried egg salad pita is good .
also i wish the dim lighting and the weak espresso could be improved .
but the bagels are good .
it 's a mixed bag .
i guess i 'd try this place once more , just to be fair .
they even have sandwiches for when i 'm hungry again !
the sandwiches are okay .
they use high quality ingredients , but they are still just sandwiches .
their soups are not great .
great place to study .
it 's an indie coffee shop which is a nice change from starbucks/panera .
drinks are really good , priced about the same as starbucks .
daily specials are on the cheap side .
food and pastries are good but a little overpriced .
i usually have a pretty good experience here .
the old woodwork in the building is peaceful .
great place for coffee and good studying !
as far as customer service , it 's fair .
not the best cafe , but i return here frequently to get studying/work done .
cafe kopi has the best cappuccino 's in champaign/urbana .
something is just not right about the espresso ; it has a metallic taste .
machine needs cleaning perhaps ?
i 've bought their beans and made stuff at home .
i really do n't know what they 're doing back there .
i do n't think they have any idea how to make espresso beverages either .
the food is good , especially the lox and cream cheese on a bagel .
i come from washington , so i know good salmon .
i 've tried , but no dice .
put some of that shit on the floor .
second , the service here is pretty iffy .
every third member of the staff is friendly and helpful .
you 're picking up my napkins and washing my plate after i leave .
you 're not better than me .
so , i du n no , i 'm torn .
i love this place !
the drinks are always delicious .
on top of this , they have consistent closing hours at midnight .
also , the sandwich sizes are tiny given their price .
i love it here .
i love the cafe miel and the mate latte .
this is my default stop for coffee or a place to spend the afternoon .
it can get a little crowded at times though .
the thai tempeh sandwhich is amazing , also try the cold brew coffee sometime .
prices are out of hand at kopi .
as best i can guess , kopi mgt .
catering ?
advertise the booze ?
i couldnt be more pleased .
the food is pretty scrumptious too .
enjoy !
try the baby greens salad or the greek salad with no feta cheese .
some soups are vegan but ask to make sure !
also , try the thai tempe or the matty pooh hummus .
for drinks , get the chai latte with soy and no honey .
and their chocolate for mochas are vegan !
i love the atmosphere here , it 's very chill .
their coffee is n't bad and the service is pretty good .
it 's all in the details .
music selection is kind of weird ( whiny sounding hipster music ?
do n't order the food unless you are desperate .
lesson learned : do n't get the thai tempeh panini .
every time i 've been here , they always get something wrong .
i just feel that the are n't very attentive .
the sandwiches are decent ( had the turkey and gruyere .
i have enjoyed kopi for a number of years .
the coffee is always decent .
i enjoy the tuna melt as well .
both are not fantastic but very solid .
however , i love their chai bomb .
it elevates my rating from _ num _ to _ num _ .
kopi is always a place to stop when in the cu area .
i do n't know .
the coffee is just ok .
chai latte is yummy and not too sweet .
the chicken salad and sugar cookies are delicious .
food presentation is fantastic .
food is way better than espresso royale ( saran wrap = no go ) .
service is prompt and usually cheerful .
leave them a good tip !
the space is great ... if you can poach a table .
for those who bike , there are racks on the curb .
it 's a great place to come study and get off campus .
the drinks are pretty good .
it 's fizzy and sweet .
the staff is super friendly and knowledgable .
after lunch and shopping what 's next ?
there 's a nice little patio , good food for lunch and great coffee !
this is my home away from home .
sometimes it 's a chocolaty blend from nicaragua or something strong from peru .
i 'm probably making this up .
there 's wi-fi , obviously .
there 's a decent food selection , too .
i love their pita and hummus .
they also have everything bagels , which i like lightly toasted and plain .
anyway , what really makes this place great is the staff .
i have no shame in spending every waking hour in this coffee shop .
i get all my work done , and i see friendly faces .
i feel like one of them .
try the latte or the tea .
also , the `` pots of tea '' are great .
the coffee is good , the tea selection is very nice .
the quality of the food is very good .
it 's as good as it gets with regard to coffee houses .
great atmosphere and character , clearly a place to study on the weekend .
recommend the turkey and brie open faced sandwich .
amazing coffee , some of the best i 've ever had .
i 've been here over a dozen times .
for a coffee shop , it 's terrible .
the only good coffee drink i 've had is the cafe miel .
also , the baked goods are just terrible .
so why am i giving it 3/5 stars ?
because the lunch is excellent .
and the environment is the best .
there are much better places in town !
the coffee is decent , too .
i think it 's overpriced and sloppy .
i love cafe kopi !
my husband and i come here every saturday and have for years .
they are efficient , courteous and always polite .
the only slight negative i would give is the scones .
that does not deter me from my _ num _ star rating !
i love this place , but wish it would be open later than midnight .
docking _ num _ star only because it 's usually hard to find a good spot .
i guess i should say something about the beverages ... tea , however , is the surprise triumph , here .
the bold green `` earthiness '' is balanced with a sweet shot of vanilla .
if you find one , you 're set .
i 've recently been experiencing very hit or miss service .
i use to love going here in the summer .
it is a mix of vanilla and honey .
let me tell you ... it is perfect .
i get it every time i am down in champaign .
i do n't think i have ever had another latte like it anywhere else .
plus their food is organic and delicious .
great place for late night studying since they 're open until midnight !
i love the big room with little lamps at the tables .
breakfast menu leaves a bit to be desired .
one the cutest and coolest coffee joints i 've ever seen .
the baristas are awesome .
i have been here a few times when my band has played in town !
i 'm a coffee shop-kind of girl .
they have a yummy hummus and the coffee is ok .
to cap it off , they 're credit card friendly !
i think cafe kopi must be the most overrated coffee shop in town .
yes , the wifi is good , but the prices are outrageous .
afe kopi is my favorite coffee shop in this town .
the baristas are angels .
nothing about the food ( appearance , taste ) are worth $ _ num _ .
their bakery items are also really bad yet somehow very expensive .
tuna salad is six dollars !
this is a great study spot with good coffee .
it has a great cozy-coffee shop feel .
they have a lot of power outlets and the music is not overpowering .
my favorite thing to get here is the chai tea latte .
the customers have this mutual understanding that it is a study spot .
they have free cucumber or orange infused water .
i know they saw us .
vibe , which , ironically , did go with the ambiance of the place .
there are stairs in the back , but do not go up these .
there is no seating !
it 's a trap !
oh , and make sure to clean up after yourselves when you 're done !
there are tubs for dishes and glassware here and there for you .
no one likes to clean up after someone else 's mess !
the ambience is eclectic and comfortable , with spacious outdoor seating .
prices are reasonable - at least compared to chicago !
amazing , relaxing atmosphere , great for doing work or just chilling .
top _ num _ cappucino in the c-u area , easily wifi is rather slow .
this espresso is divine .
it 's just delightful , and the employees are wonderful here the cafe is totally worth a visit .
i live locally and often go to kopi to study for tests .
just watch your timing !
cafe kopi is hands down my favorite coffee shop in the cu area .
i can not even count the number of times i have journeyed to kopi .
my favorite thing to order in the winter is the gingerbread chai latte .
it has the perfect combination of cinnamon , coffee , and gingerbread notes .
in the summer i have iced tea .
if you go there often , consider buying a kopi cup .
you get discounts if you bring it in !
the atmosphere is what really gets me .
the wooden tables look rugged , but they are so smooth !
there is local artwork on the walls that gives a `` hometown '' atmosphere .
there is about _ num _ or _ num _ tables outside that you can sit at .
avoid until they get over themselves .
i love this place !
it 's a cool space , different wooden chairs/tables and some chill tunes .
they have awesome staff members and delicious drinks .
i like the americano , or mocha lattes .
good coffee and environment with internet to do work .
love the wood table and chairs .
need a study break ?
getting sleepy ?
grab one of their caffeinated drinks .
i like the outdoor tables .
they have a ton of teas , baked goods and seating too .
not many places offer almond , soy , and coconut milk .
i appreciate the options since i ca n't have dairy .
the music is softer than a few other places in town .
around lunch time , it can be hard to find a table .
check it out .
i specifically love their teas and lattes .
literally , they use old desks from the university .
the baristas are always super friendly , nice , and helpful .
the coffee is solid and the food there is perfect for what it is .
the drinks are good .
food is ok .
can be crowded & loud at times .
love the ambience .
the barristers are super friendly , the place is nice .
to top it , they usually have some daily specials on expresso drinks !
what exactly is a four star coffee shop ?
i 'm not a coffee lover so my understanding of their prices is minimal .
however , they do have bagels , croissants , and muffins .
cafe kopi is large with many seating areas .
they also have free wifi , which is a plus .
i am a huge fan of fizzy water so they were both great !
i appreciate their consistent presence in downtown champaign .
staff is always on point .
i like coffee .
i like vegetarian food .
i like good places to hang out and enjoy both of these things .
this place has that .
plus sweet sugary treats .
be there .
one of the best spots i 've found during my time in c-u .
the interior is really warm and cozy .
they also have free wifi .
so this place is definitely one of the gems in downtown champaign .
it 's very similar to aroma cafe and pekara bakery in the area .
they have a larger seating space than the other cafes though .
i double checked my balance and it 's fine '' .
call the bank if you want .
but leave .
i need you to leave the counter now '' but thanks anyway for throwing a little negativity my way .
love the atmosphere here .
coffee is delicious and services are very friendly .
i really love cafe kopi !
i also love their chai latte !
ithis place has a very cozy feel to it !
i love finding local hidden gems and checking them out .
though cafe kopi is n't so hidden , the inside is completely unsuspecting .
the crowd here is very friendly and surprisingly open .
please try it .
what makes this beverage pop is the honey .
their great for staying and savoring your beverage or for on the go .
when i think of champaign i think of cafe kopi .
it has that cool , hipster coffee shop vibe that i crave .
i recommend trying the red latte and chicken salad pita .
those are my favorites .
whenever i need a place to relax i choose kopi .
it 's so cool seeing what other people have left behind .
check it out !
that 's me being very picky , though .
also , the service is always lacked .
it 's strange .
happy that they are open on a sunday .
i know i will visit more often .
i have only been here a couple of times .
store is not at address on neil street .
it is near hhgregg on prospect .
this store , on par with most , is an extravaganza of the senses !
from chiffon by the bolt to potpourri fragrance packets , joann 's stock assails !
can benefit from a trip !
say it with me now : blaaaaaaaaaand .
i 've always ordered pad thai , and i like it .
that is the only thing i order whenever i go there .
i dig nitaya .
: ) so much so , that ti deserves a five star .
now , can we make the food a bit more exciting next time ?
they can even specialize yours by making it more spicy if you want .
nitaya thai is a good thai restaurant .
their pad thai with chicken is very good .
i find the portions to be more than enough and the pricing reasonable .
go trya nitaya !
the food is good here , quite good actually .
their pad thai is fairly good .
it 's not drowned with peanut sauce so you can actually taste the tamarind .
the decor is dated classic for a thai restaurant .
they have a full bar , which is really nice .
their green curry is delectable .
i cook thai food at home .
i know what different fish taste like .
nitaya , how do you survive ?
the food is not offensively bad , just forgettable . )
the food is delicious .
they give you a free soup to begin , which was nice and warming .
the waitstaff is friendly and professional .
the only weird thing is how empty the place always is .
this place is a health hazard .
also , the few bites of pad thai that i did have were awful .
i understand , sometimes things may end up in the food .
my only issue is that the portions could be a little bit bigger .
the space is weird , but makes it different .
feels like your at mom 's house being served hot/fresh , delicious food .
sweet sweet , fast wait staff , lovely environment if only i 'd written this review so much sooner * smh * soooo yummy good food but they need to be more consistent .
in fact , i think their food is the best thai in town .
, and a rice bean noodle dish i love .
i order everything medium , heat wise and it 's still pretty hot .
food is good too .
this place has the best tom yum soup in all of champaign / urbana !
do n't judge a book by its cover !
i wish they had mee krob with the red sweet & sour sauce .
i like my food really , really spicy .
keep in mind i fix tacos with bhut jolokias and habanero peppers .
i like spicy food .
so far , it is my top in champaign .
but i think i 'll never visit this restaurant again .
their food is average .
nitaya thai never disappoints !
the crab rangoon is amazing .
my fav is the pad thai .
it is full of flavor .
be careful when choosing your spice level !
medium spicy is plenty spicy and i love spicy food .
some of the best thai food i have had in a long time .
they have the best pad thai in town .
if you are looking for real thai food go here !
have tried some of their noodles before which is good .
that being said , it 's definitely not my favorite place in the area .
but eating there is just kind of depressing sometimes .
this review is for take out service .
warning check your credit cards and bill !
what 's worse ?
dont eat here unless you want a two month ordeal for fraud charges .
avoid this dirty horrible establishment at all costs !
she states because she did n't hear me speak .
anyway , reporting her to the health department .
can i report her to the police too for verbal assault ?
decent pad thai that is prepared pretty quickly .
my _ num _ year old step daughter loves it too .
never once have gotten sick like some previous yelpers have .
i think i 'll just do that next time .
consequently there is usually no room for negotiation with these guys .
the worst is , they have bedbugs .
jsm is timely , polite , friendly , and knowledgeable .
praise be the three-lettered divinity that is jsm .
jsm is great .
*** update *** the roach problem is out of control .
yup -- there are roaches in my water boiler .
my apartment has already been sprayed three times now .
*** update *** hey , jsm ?
why are you doing construction in our units while we are living here ?
it feels like i 'm living in the dust bowl .
and no i do n't mean _ num _ days .
do i want to wake up to this for months ?
we 're just cash cows and you 're sucking them titties til they crispy .
you do n't give a fuck about the people behind the rent .
thanks a fuckton for drilling all over my clothes , purses , and shoes .
and there 's shit all over my bed .
do i get a cleanup ?
can i at least get a quarter of my monthly rent back ?
oh by the way , the roaches are back too .
parents , be aware of jsm .
i still remember the first day i moved in and carpet cleaned .
jsm owns and poorly runs uptown crossing in normal , illinois .
if you are thinking of renting here ... do n't do it !
the apartments are not in good shape considering that they are fairly new .
stay away from jsm properties ... they should be sanctioned for their misrepresentations .
it is sad how continually they are allowed to take advantage of their tenants .
the construction is getting ridiculous at this point .
spring break is over now .
this is not right .
it 's not fair .
i want my rent back .
this is pushing a month .
what 's the point of paying $ 500 + for a sub-par storage room ?
this is ridiculous .
who does long construction while people are living there ?
where are we supposed to go ?
that 's just not right .
today is april _ num _ , _ num _ .
you fill in the blanks about why jsm is getting a one star .
the apartment is a mess .
they do n't care about their tenants .
jsm is notorious for disrespecting their tenants .
they , i quote , are `` dogs '' .
do not give them your half + grand a month .
# nevertrustascamlord bet that makes abuses of landlord-tenant trust pretty convenient .
i value a functioning filter , but not in this case .
feel my anger and do not rent from jsm .
i guess ?
that 's weird because my apartment was still dirty .
i 'm still shaking out paint chips and sawdust from my clothes .
thank you for ruining my leather bags and clothes with white paint dust .
i 'm a student .
i need somewhere to live .
i do not have time to play maid , jsm .
lol , jsm , why did n't you bring people in impromptu during construction ?
watch out .
send a cleaning crew for that , bitch .
*** update *** jsm has not responded to a single one .
it is now the summer and they have yet to respond dear jsm , there is only _ num _ desk that came with my apartment .
just do n't rent from jsm .
i hope more students see this review and inform their little sophomore friends .
they are really nice and individually wonderful .
the building is absolutely riddled with roaches .
do n't even think about leaving a glass of water out overnight .
you forget once and you 're asking for trouble .
this has been the most disgusting experience of my life .
avoid living here .
it has been ineffective .
kid , you have it good .
that ai n't nothing .
it 's a huge waste of time .
do n't live here .
yes , i have dead roaches falling out of my stuff .
again , do n't live here .
i 've never seen any trash or lint lying around .
the machines are always super clean .
every common space just looks pristine .
i really appreciate that .
this unit is by far the worse unit you can possibly get yourself into .
not to mention the place is infested with spiders !
the management office staff members are extremely rude and inefficient with their duties .
do not live with them .
they do not care at all about you .
chinese herbs are the best solution to treat them .
plus , herbs have no side effects beside it does not taste good .
dr ge has helped me twice with my health .
dr. ge has been my acupuncturist for over _ num _ years .
his knowledge and practice has significantly improved the quality of my life .
that statement has always become true for me .
i like farren 's pretty well for a happy hour type dinner .
the grilled steak salad and sweet potato fries are my favorites .
the everything-topped crackers that accompany the salads are light , and a real treat .
and their prices have stayed the same for years now ( unreal , no ? )
, which translates into a good deal in _ num _ .
yes , they have good burgers and a mean veggie burger .
but mostly , just go to farren 's for the salads !
farren 's is one of those hidden gems you do n't find everyday .
if its your first time time i defiantly recommend trying one of their burgers .
im not sure what 's better their burgers or salads .
they also have outstanding wings and beers !
farren 's has a delicious , mouthwatering burger that puts others to shame .
it 's that good .
unless you 're a vegetarian , or kosher or hindu .
then you can refrain from the slapping , and just glare in frustration .
fries are tasty too , but relatively standard fare .
i have to say i was disappointed .
have tried two desserts there - a carrot cake and a lemon pie .
get a burger and a beer and you wo n't be disappointed .
the scallop salad is to die for .
the restrooms can be nasty and are shared with a couple of adjoining restaurants .
staff is great .
food is great .
place is great .
i normally get the black bean tacos and love them their food is awesome !
that earns respect from me on two levels - _ num _ .
you can see into the kitchen !
and they are very knowledgeable about their food and their beer , etc ... happy booze and burger-ing !
cheers this is my favorite restaurant in champaign !
i always get a bacon burger and it is amazing .
i have never had a burger under or over cooked .
the fries are always good .
i also love their beer menu .
i have brought friends , family and girlfriend , with no complaints !
parking is not an problem with the parking deck right next door .
they also have an amazing molten chocolatey dessert .
and , i 've always had excellent service .
we love farren 's for it 's off-the-beaten-path location and unexpectedly good food .
my wife always gets the strawberry and walnut salad .
it 's delicious .
fortunately for me , she can never finish it .
a great find .
the key lime pie is also a must-have .
the food is sooo good .
but it is more then a pub .
diver scallops some times !
interesting and changing wine selections .
i hate beer , but i hear they have a great selection .
the leaving with a laugh way .
this is my favorite .
go there now and have a good burger .
it satisfies the `` hard-core '' hunger .
making my mouth water even now .
i guess the meat was kind of dry .
i really do n't get what the big deal is with this place .
this place is over rated .
they use interesting local ingredients ( lemon chive potato salad was awesome ) .
right now they have a special on krusovice , a great czech pilsner .
service is fast and friendly at the bar .
this has improved somewhat .
because that 's what you 'll get in this poorly ventilated basement .
( at least that 's the best excuse i can think of . )
the specials menu continues this high standard .
i can only attribute the positive yelp reviews to heavy drinking .
you have been warned .
it 's the best burger in cu and regularly wins awards for it .
my personal favorite is the fish and chips , which runs $ _ num _ .
to me , it makes no difference .
so why am i giving this place three stars ?
and then toss the salad to mix in that pink dressing .
upcharge to get fries or up-upcharge for sweet potato fries or the potato chips .
basement feel , schmasement feel ... it is a bar .
cool how the bathrooms connect you to nearby thai and sushi restaurants .
farren 's pub & eatery is has a casual type of atmosphere .
their burgers here are so delicious and juicy !
i 'm almost getting hungry right now just thinking about it .
the feel of the restaurant is cozy , the beer prices are good .
the service is very friendly and everyone seems happy to be there .
this is definitely a regular in my restaurant rotation !
farren 's is one of my favorite restaurants in town .
the hamburgers here are very thick , so make sure you 're hungry !
great burgers but i go for the chicken tacos for lunch .
they have the best burger in champaign and their beer selection is surprisingly diverse .
the burgers and salads are wonderful .
i love going to farren 's for lunch .
i usually get the steak salad , which is excellent .
best burgers i have ever had , probably .
or at least the burgers that all other places are judged by .
the russell is amazing ... looking for great ambience ?
look elsewhere .
give me a russell or a motherlode with fries .
there is often the option of texas kobe beef or bison for the burger .
the staff has been friendly .
my boyfriend and i have been there many times .
we love the relaxing and hipster atmosphere .
the service is great -- everyone is genuinely friendly .
the food is excellent .
it 's all pouring oil out the wazoo .
prices are reasonable too .
yes , it 's in a sort of a basement almost .
it 's just far too greasy for me .
this is a great hole in the wall place .
it is n't the easiest to find if you have n't already been there .
they have a lot of good food and the service is very courteous .
staff is friendly .
stop by if you get the chance .
def a hole in the wall worth going to !
good food , hard to find , decent beer .
this is an excellent upscale pub food place that was a go-to in c-u .
thank you farren 's !
i absolutely love farren 's !
i always order the steak salad ... every time !
this is one great steak salad !
the service is always fast as well ... even during their busy lunch rush !
it 's a bit on the pricey side , but well worth it !
the salad is loaded down with steak .
sirloin , i think .
finally , it 's topped with big chunks of blue cheese !
definitely a place to try and go again and again !
it 's nothing fancy , just a nice burger joint .
i do n't let myself go to farren 's often .
here 's an example of my average inner monologue during a farren 's visit .
oooh , beer i 've never had !
farren 's is awesome .
the service has always been friendly and prompt .
really hope to go back before i graduate .
this is the epitome of a hole in the wall restaurant with great food .
the service is great , always friendly and very efficient .
farrens , to say the least , has become a home-away-from-home .
anytime someone is looking for a good beer , i direct them here .
this is definitely a champaign must !
the sum-up : pub food at it 's finest .
we 're new to the area and have heard good things about farren 's .
this place is gold !
these burgers are ridiculous .
no one else comes close .
this is the 2nd time to this place in about _ num _ years time .
update !
they 're toasty brown and delicious , especially when doused with malt vinegar .
they also have a full bar and great apps , specials , and desserts .
i sometimes just get the hummus plate app for dinner .
and the fish n chips special is pretty darn good for being land locked .
the environment is very laid back and the restaurant is fairly dim .
they also have an excellent beer selection that varies from visit to visit .
if fish and chips is on the special menu i get that .
with winter comes their chili which i can never get enough of .
the beer selection is always superb .
very grateful to be able to do something other than fries .
you can tell they are committed to having the best burgers in town .
a bar runs a long the back , with tables scattered .
the service is usually pretty good .
they do the best they can when the place is slammed .
the food is great .
of coarse the burgers are what they are known for .
which are great .
the salads are also really good .
a great place to come for a beer and a meal .
service has always been friendly and efficient .
usually busy , though i 've never waited long .
`` farren 's has the best burgers in town . ''
prices are not too expensive , though a bit higher than campus town .
the location is a bit strange - sort of in a back alley .
the burgers are indeed quite good !
lots to choose from on the menu .
cooked perfectly and one of the best burgers i have ever eaten .
i 'm a firm believer that burgers can only be so good .
that being said , these guys make a pretty good burger .
beer selection is good .
it 's a nice atmosphere .
everything is right there .
definitely recommend giving it a try !
it 's nothing special , neither good nor bad .
wait staff was prompt and inviting .
it 's worth a try , right ?
best food i 've had in c-u thus far .
( a heart attack waiting to happen , but so good ! )
caroline and her staff are the best !
i have never felt more comfortable and welcome in any restaurant !
the food is consistently amazing and the specials are always outstanding .
that stuff is fantastic , and totally worth every extra penny .
beer selection is okay , and they rotate stuff throughout the year .
staff is also very nice .
still an excellent place to go .
farrens may not have the fanciest atmosphere , but the burgers are great !
the fries are made from real potatoes , the service is very kind .
you can tell that they use high quality ingredients .
fries are pretty standard , but burgers are fantastic .
be cautious of the red hair waitress !
then why exactly am i paying upwards of $ _ num _ for this frozen bullshit ?
tortilla chips come standard and it 's extra for fries ?
farrens is a great place to eat !
the burgers are top notch !
the salad just finishes the meal .
chips and fries are both made in house and are pretty good .
onion rings do n't come close to the cost .
fish has been okay .
i wish they had better bread for everything .
some of the waitstaff are just jerks .
`` hey , can i have an extra bleu cheese sauce , please ? ''
`` you already have one . ''
giant eyeroll and _ num _ minutes to get it , despite the empty bar .
there are a lot of other places to eat in cu .
about the food -- the burgers are as good as any i have had .
the place gets very busy .
the staff hustles .
they run thru the maze of tables .
they get everything right and maintain a cool composure .
they are friendly and go out of their way to be helpful .
i do n't give many five star reviews , but this place deserves it .
a good meat-to-bun-ratio and a manageable stack .
but tortilla chips come standard with the burger , instead of fries ?
it 's slightly on the pricey side but you wo n't be disappointed .
hands down - farren 's is awesome !
i always order the steak salad and my girlfriend has the scallop salad .
both are huge and loaded down with meat .
service can be a little hectic , but great food at good prices .
check it out !
food is always top notch .
the only thing keeping me from _ num _ stars is the service .
she may as well have said `` you 're not welcome here .
go away ! ''
frankly , i 'm not sure when we will go back .
the black burger is bomb !
the burgers are n't the only good part .
they have daily specials that have always been satisfying and unique .
they also have some stellar dark beers .
only fries in champaign i can have with my soy , gluten allergy .
and they are amazeballs !
i 'm enjoying an order now .
them burgers is huge , boy .
i do love the taste of a good burger .
i love the open atmosphere .
its slightly pricey , but the food is well worth it .
and it 's a wonderful difference .
farren 's has an awesome burger .
this place is great .
anything with blue-cheese and/or bacon is a winner .
it does have its quirks , though .
one of my favorite places to eat out in cu .
they have a solid draft selection as well as a well-rounded menu .
the spicoli is the first-timer 's go-to .
their * real * [ emphasis on that ] ginger ale is real .
i 'm not quite sure about the appetizers .
but , it 's definitely not a bad price .
has more of a darker , but cheerful , environment compared to other bars .
the russell is a must have .
i recommend getting it with a kobe patty .
farrens is not easily located as the entrance is down an alley .
i think that is what helped me !
this place is super casual .
i am so glad i copied him .
sweet fruity dressing , tasty scallops .
also make sure you get the crackers that come with the salad !
apparently , their burgers are good too ... .
love me some farren 's .
hamburgers are their specialty , with the `` russell '' as their house style .
im gon na sum this up quickly .
and i smell like a resturant !
many will tell you this is the best burger in town .
fries are very tasty .
service is good .
prices are a little steep for a burger .
horrible , maybe burgers are good , but i do not like being ignored .
the elaine salad is so yummy i definitely recommend it .
their beer selection is a little limited i think .
on a weekend night there 's usually a line if you arrive after _ num _ .
but it 's great that way .
give me a break .
i wish this place was a `` locals only '' hidden gem ... great salads for anyone looking to have somethings a little lighter .
the hostess is terribly rude and nasty .
the seating is horrible .
whenever you want a good burger , go to farrens .
they have put thought into their menu , and their burgers are cooked perfectly .
the beer selection is good .
the atmosphere is noisy .
the wait is about 20-30 min on weekends .
like many places in chambana the menu does n't change from year to year .
if you 're calorie conscious take half of your burger home like i do .
very good food , cozy little place , kinda difficult to find .
not for folks in a hurry but worth it for those who wait this is the place to go to get burgers !
the place has such a personality , given the house chips and hole-in-the-wall-osity .
i 'm craving it already .
their kobe burger is filled with fun flavor .
the portabello mushroom dish is actually two large fried mushrooms .
it can be a tad difficult to get the waiters ' attention sometimes though .
this may just be my favorite place to eat in c-u !
the staff has always been really friendly too !
i love farrens .
the fries are ok .
service is usually decent .
price is a little high but i think it 's worth it .
the appetizer of scallops are great !
plus they always have a decent and unexpected on-tap beer selection .
this is slowly becoming a favorite go-to place .
it 's nothing fancy and probably does n't want to be .
my only minor qualm with the place is the service .
strongly recommend , 4/5 !
the food here is always top notch !
its just as good as anything i 've had in new orleans .
always satisfying .
definitely going to come back if i 'm back in champaign .
i have eaten here more times than i can remember .
the place is cramped and they are understaffed .
i feel like more people in champaign should be talking about farren 's .
the food is well ... american .
you owe yourself to give it a try .
highly recommend this restaurant !
but the food was excellent , there 's no doubting it .
highly recommend !
farren 's is the definition of a hole in the wall restaurant in champaign .
note : your whole party has to be present in order to be seated .
this is due to their limited space .
the price is a little steep compared to other burger places .
i believe that it is worth it .
the noise level is higher than average because it is such a small place .
do n't let that stop you .
go to farren 's !
they get busy and i understand that but sometimes too slow .
the burgers are cooked to perfection and the onion rings are too good .
it is in a weird location but i guess it works .
you have to go here !
burgers are awesome ( and huge ) .
staff is always friendly .
this is probably the best burger i have even had .
and i do n't say that lightly .
the servers are running around and helping everyone at once .
do yourself a favor and plan to not eat dinner and eat lunch here .
i 'm just gon na say it : the best burgers in town .
i am honestly obsessed with farren 's .
the burgers are phenomenal .
just do n't expect fancy decor and you 'll be good !
i repeatedly try this place but they.get.it right only .1 out if _ num _ times .
their burgers are unmatched .
but honestly that 's part of why i love it .
farren 's is fantastic , do n't miss it .
definitely going again !
their ground beef is unreal .
it 's a disservice to the burger to put ketchup on these badboys .
they cook them well-done , and still they 're juicy and tasty !
my favorite is the spiccoli , it 's swiss , mushroom and onions .
my brother convinced me to eat downtown instead of going out for indian .
i have heard a number of good things about farren 's so i agreed .
i like holes in the wall , but boy is this one .
so that is what i ordered .
i do find the place to be a bit dirty .
advice : eat quickly and get out .
these burgers are absolutely amazing !
this place is great !
if you are a vegetarian the veggie burger is a must try !
my boyfriend absolutely loves this place .
i 'm a little indifferent .
i wish they had dijon mustard - only plain yellow mustard is available .
boy was i jealous he can enjoy red meat this much !
and it 's a yes .
we decide to meet there at 6:30 .
we park , and walk to farrens .
we go down the ramp into farrens .
i make eye contact with the server he points to a table .
no one else sees him point to the table .
and i 'm like ... do you know who i am !
( seems to be a recurring theme , that triptych stuff is everywhere ) .
i order a beer on draft , the lady orders a beer on draft .
the sister asks `` do you only have that craft stuff on draft ? ''
she gets , i think , a coors light .
how can you drink mass produced beer with craft food ?
kridz orders the mozzarella sticks .
i get the portabella mushroom appetizer .
the moz sticks are moz sticks .
nothing too fancy ( it seems ) about them .
hell , this thing is practically a meal to itself .
if this is on the menu , get it .
and i 'm like `` uh ... that 's butter '' .
then they are like `` who puts butter in their mac an cheese ? ''
butter makes everything better , as does bacon .
i finish my burger .
i have blue cheese sauce throughout my mustache and beard .
thus is the struggle i deal with .
i have another beer .
everyone else finishes eating .
farren 's is the prototypical hole-in-the-wall establishment .
but every time i go there , it 's packed to the door .
the food is amazing .
i love the green chile cheeseburger because it reminds me of home .
ask them to replace the pepper jack cheese with cheddar .
ask for extra salsa !
not open late .
be prepared to wait .
i have had the bacon bbq chicken sandwich and the chips .
flag down someone by waving and shouting ) then another 15 + to be seated .
food , whenver they get around to bringing it .
nothing particularly good to say about the food .
why bother ?
i mean it was n't bad , but ... .
the portions are pretty hefty .
probably the best onion rings i 've had at uiuc .
for your money i think the place is great .
not that that makes them plain , by any stretch .
but just understand , that 's their focus and what they do best .
thumbs up to them for trying new things .
it 's not much for ambiance , except it nails the neighborhood pub ambiance .
i love farren 's burgers .
i find them to be too salty .
they also have good salads , if you want some lighter fare .
definitely it was the last time that we chosen this place yup , i 'm a fan .
the truffle chips are good , usually a few under-cooked ones that slip by .
if you want a fancy restaurant get the f out of a corn field .
after-all this is a bar , in a basement , in a college town .
they make good burgers .
i think i need to return and have the russell .
it is not a huge place , but we 'll worth any wait .
which burger you like best depends on your taste .
as for appetizers , we 've tried the buffalo wings with blue cheese dressing .
i 've sworn to get this every time i go back .
back to the good , we like the atmosphere at farren 's .
it 's got a relaxed , grown-up , neighborhood gastro-pub feel .
there 's no parking lot specifically for farren 's .
the 4/5 is due to size .
this is a great place for high quality food and a nice time .
their burgers are huge and they give you tons of fries .
if you want large portions of great food go here .
if you want dim lighting , few distractions , and nice seating go here .
maybe they are understaffed .
_ num _ stars for food _ num _ stars for value _ num _ stars for service what 's not to love ?
the worker over there is rude !
what kind of customer service is this ?
this place has the worst service ever .
when you have people being served cups of ice cream give them a spoon .
this place is in need of training help .
i know .
( can you say cheat day ?
dunkin donuts iced coffee is cheap and rad .
this location is convenient and is hardly ever busy .
too expensive for what it is .
i love dunkin ' donuts .
the donuts are pretty good .
however , not all the donuts are in stock at a given time .
i appreciate having someplace to grab a snack with early morning black friday shopping .
i love the dunkin on green and neil .
i stop by for coffee on twice a week before an evening class .
there is one lady that i always see and she is super friendly !
the donuts here taste stale and the employees are n't the most welcoming people .
this location seems to be out of the donuts i want consistently .
this place is really fast with their drive thru service and their indoor service .
i enjoy getting the $ _ num _ coffee .
their breakfast items are good .
i like their egg and sausage croissant .
dunkin donuts coffee is best enjoyed with cream and sugar .
usually go in car , but no more .
as i write this i 'm at panerai having a tastey bagel sandwhich .
the donuts are stale monday-saturday .
sundays they are fresh .
why do they keep putting them out ?
love the $ _ num _ coffee and the egg and cheese croissants .
i have had several pairs of pants hemmed here .
always an apology and a request to come back tomorrow .
they also take forever !
what 's that lesson ?
do n't go to yong 's !
unfortunately i also think that language is a barrier .
i have worked with yong 's for about _ num _ years .
the great impasta has some extremely rich and luscious food .
the chef tries hard to incorporate lots of ingredients from local farms .
to make the experience perfect , the service i had was absolutely wonderful .
that is extremely rare on our friday nights in downtown cu .
it 's honestly pretty good .
the service is attentive without being obnoxious .
the fresh , hot bread is always good .
excessive grease is used .
also , avoid goin on the thursday nights .
they have a stupid live band .
go to perkins instead ( if you have dietary restrictions ) or biaggi 's ( reserve online if you hate waiting + want good food ) the service is attentive but not obnoxious , and the bread is always great .
i like to be able to * see * my food .
the great impasta is fantastic .
their lunch menu has excellent selections .
the service is exceptional as well .
do n't try it at home ) .
go while you can .
the food is good , the bartenders amenable , the staff fantastic .
go now .
log off the damn computer , hop a flight if you have to .
and the food is solid , save the strogonoff .
do n't leave impasta , i love you .
update : 6/20 .
i have been there for lunch .
nothing of that is left , the memories barely .
bottom line : avoid like the plague .
to make matters worse , the lighting in place feels like stage spotlights .
i miss the old downtown champaign location .
the urbana restaurant lacks the charm and coziness that the great impasta once had .
let me first preface my review with some background .
i have no such high expectations from the local `` eye-talian '' businesses .
perhaps this seems a harsh review .
so it is with ethnic cuisine .
a lot just depends upon what you are used to .
slowest service i 've ever had in my life .
it pains me deeply to give the great impasta only two stars .
the food is a pale ghost of its former self .
the pasta is often over cooked .
the sauces which used to be very special have become indifferent .
original commitment to quality is key to success .
what a difference removing a little brake dust makes !
this , my friends , is great service !
worst service i have ever received at a subway .
this is the worst subway in champaign-urbana !
this store is ok .
night at _ num _ pm to pick up a sandwich .
what kind of a manager is that ?
`` no work trucks in parking lot '' all of their stuff is clean , high-quality and youthful .
the frequent buyer/seller card does n't hurt either .
i definitely have better luck at tj maxx for sure .
lately though things have changed .
i almost always find something great .
i do n't know but i 'm pleased .
it takes soooo much effort to find anything .
what everyone 's wearing from the mall .
overall though plato 's is n't a bad place .
that 's simply not true .
i 've seen plenty of great brands and unique pieces .
if you 're willing to dig there 's some great stuff here .
too many mall brand names that are just in bad taste .
i usually stick to buying over selling .
i 'm also surprised by some of the negative reviews posted for new life .
lunchbox is an awesome artist with a good sense of humor .
i love the atmosphere in here .
so really , there 's nothing else to say .
this is just the place to go .
i 'm pretty shocked by the reviews here .
also , they accept credit cards , but you should totally pay cash .
asshole credit card companies charge these guys way too much to use their service .
pay cash and go to new life !
lunchbox is awesome !
definitely check this place out , a central part to campus culture .
i also appreciate his honesty .
he does n't sugar coat anything , which is a trait i really appreciate .
i 've always felt so welcome here , and i highly recommend it .
lunchbox lives up to his reputation !
okay , i 'm gon na give this place a _ num _ start rating .
gross , i know .
it 's a tough call on this place .
he also has two tattoos that look really amazing .
they are understaffed today , which is totally acceptable considering it 's spring break .
i will totally be going back for any other piercings i want .
lunch box is amazing !
i definitely recommend for all piercings .
we all love our tattoos !
lunch box is the go to guy !
my tattoo is great and im super happy with it !
i like _ num _ hours away but its sooooooo worth the trip !
i 'm not sure ) .
he marks my ears .
i go through with it .
well , it 's the next day and it looks like garbage .
i have n't heard anything back .
there is no way that i can go to work with this .
probably going to take them out if they do n't completely heal by january .
i 've never had keloids ... but that dude is beyond proud/stubborn .
avoid this dude at all costs .
the place itself is very interesting .
the minimum is $ _ num _ which is great considering they are right on campus .
every experience i 've had has been so positive .
lunchbox did mine , he 's awesome .
they have a minimum charge of $ _ num _ , but i highly recommend them !
it also has pitchers of pbr and oldstyle for cheap .
even more fun is the live music performed when i was there this week .
the bar is dark and a little dusty .
there are a few video games and even a megatouch .
if you want a great laid back joint nearby , try bunny 's .
i 've only been to the rose bowl on one particular night , tuesday .
they have bluegrass music .
it 's always been fun , pitchers are cheap .
it 's dark and has a dive bar feel .
the only food available is tater chips .
this tavern is like chesney 's song `` when i see this bar '' regulars and new comers alike feel at home here .
and lack any sort of smash that would make them worth paying for .
they do n't exactly melt in your mouth .
also , lack of free wireless makes academic types very sad .
fun place to stop for a treat if you 're trecking across campus .
i 've been to the urbana location twice .
oh well for an illinois treat : ) i love their chocolate selection .
they play with different flavors , different shapes , and different combinations .
i especially like their ice cream cone shaped candies .
and their coffee drinks are to die for !
know what you 're getting into .
the drinks are worth trying but it is not great .
which one are you ?
their dark chocolate bars are pretty cheap and pretty yummy .
moonstruck is definitely not my cup of tea .
not cool .
moonstruck is a mixed bag of goodies for me .
on one hand , they have some amazing drinks , especially their hot chocolates .
they do have a very nice second floor , though .
are coffee places even allowed to not have wireless anymore ?
i wonder what happened / what is going to go in there instead .
moonstruck is closed ?
i never want to go on another date again = ( you were overpriced and full of yourself ( really , charging for wifi ?
i miss this place .
but only when it was `` bub 's . ''
not that that is a bad thing for college .
; p i just miss my little bub 's .
eeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww this place is only good for picking up dumb underage girls .
this place is unbelievably shit .
do not go there .
there are way too many underage drinkers .
it 's crowded .
and the staff never seems to remember who has wrist bands .
these guys do n't .
they do n't .
all in all , it 's a shit bar .
do n't go there .
red lion is where dreams come true .
you do n't put drunk people on a stage without some precautions , guys .
always drunk people standing on tables and spilling beer .
the large wrap around bar means no lines .
who knows ?
however , the place is pretty nasty .
yup , it 's that kind of place .
even when you do get served , it appears everything is really expensive .
the inside bouncers/barbacks usually are n't too bothersome .
i really do n't know .
the outside bouncers/door guys are even more aggravating .
i now have a creased driver 's license .
phone number is incorrect .
always cover for any age and drinks are mediocre .
are you a fan of dancing on tables ?
then this is the place for you .
drinks are cheap enough , but there 's a cover charge ... dirtiest bar ever !
this is one of the nicer taco bells that i 've ever been to .
they also make a nice triple steak burrito .
i am only giving two stars because of the drive through .
it is notoriously slow .
and there is no way to get out of line either .
this happens every time i use the drive through .
avoid !
food has always been ok but the soap issue is a deal breaker .
how i miss wine night on tuesday nights !
; ) i miss dollar corona night !
not sure if they still have it .
probably because the bartenders wear button-downs and ties .
there is always a line at this place and there is always a cover .
this is a place to see and be seen .
definitely the place to be on tuesday 's for $ _ num _ bottles of wine .
it gets crowded on the weekends and the building is actually pretty nice .
i like how it is set up .
they serve food and there is a coffee bar in the front !
the decor is great - cleaned up very nicely , looks really classy .
also ... is there draft beer ?
so , everyone on the dance floor can see you while you wait .
sometimes guys knock .
wine night - how i loathe/heart thee .
always a pretty long line to get in .
this bar is definitely making a comeback .
they are also a coffee bar by day ?
but i guess they are one of the nicer ones now .
oh , except this party also charges $ _ num _ cover .
writing this review as i sit inside the floor-to-ceiling windows .
nothing like coming home for the holidays ... * new decor , new dance floor , new seating , pretty awesome * local djs who play decent dance music * go here if you like to dance ( or at least attempt ) .
otherwise avoid .
and wow is there a difference .
the space has been optimized .
in fact , this bar seems designed for dancing .
i have to say that the bathrooms are pretty decent .
the drink specials are nice in my opinion .
tuesdays are wine night , where you can get bottles for $ _ num _ .
thursdays are $ _ num _ skyy/wild turkey and chaser night .
and even saturdays the pricing is decent .
there is n't very much selection , but welcome to campus bars .
the clientele in there ranges from nerds to the simply fratastic .
girls that tend to frequent this bar seem to be pretty friendly to me .
if you want to avoid cover get here before _ num _ .
the bouncers do n't mess with you unless you give them reason to .
the crowd is very diverse and energetic .
see you again soon cly 's !
the menu has plenty of choices for everyone .
there is a nice selection of appetizers , sandwiches , salads , and pizzas .
they also offer nice coffee drinks and university employees get a discount !
what 's better than that ?
lots to choose from on the menu and the service is quick and friendly .
have been back several times and tried different menu items and always enjoyed .
try the irish nachos .
clybourne 's are excellent .
drinks are very weak .
too loud to hear anything .
floor is very slippery .
joes has a better dance floor .
firehaus has more class .
cover charges _ num _ .
even longer restroom lines _ num _ .
listening to ridiculously-loud music while patrons `` dance '' , a.k.a .
this place is the best for dancing .
do n't get me wrong .
you need to be eight shots deep to enjoy this place .
this is a place for undergrads that want to get hammered and dance .
if you do n't like to dance , dont come .
you 're paying five dollars to stand and listen to really loud music .
this is also one of the few ethnically diverse bars on campus .
there 's a reason this line is so big every weekend .
clys has people of every race and very attractive ones at that .
the drinks are so-so , but i love the dancing here .
people are very ... unique and spontaneous with their moves .
it 's a great time for just $ _ num _ cover on a weekend .
like their music which is more hip-hop .
i effing hate this place .
smells like puke .
literally everything from floor to ceiling is somehow sticky and drink spillage was everywhere .
drinks are okay ... but just okay .
ugggh i hate this subway .
i agree , quite likely the worst subway on the planet .
the employees do not care _ num _ % about you , or your order .
i agree with the previous two reviewers .
( breakfast subs are available from 7-11 ) silvermine next door is so much better .
this place is wonderful .
go here .
i guess they were ordered to cease and desist by the recording industry .
there is no call to ever patronize a lackluster video .
rentertainment has what you want .
i 'm probably the only person alive who remembers that .
you want it .
they most likely have it .
you can probably find leftovers still being given away in the store .
dvds are also for sale here .
a venerable campus institution that has saved countless students from blockbuster and general boredom .
just walk through it once and you 'll understand .
oh and check out the best b-movie list .
that 's an amusing drunken evening just waiting to happen .
suck it , blockbuster - rentertainment til i die .
check imdb/rottentom movie ratings/reviews before you rent .
they have a computer hooked up to the internet in the store !
top movie rental lists for each genre are put up all around the store .
this place really spoils you .
http : / / www.apple.com/itunes/store/movies.html sue them ?
this is my favorite movie rental place of all time .
their foreign film selection is unsurpassed .
i have to echo all the praise for rentertainment that other have given it .
i miss it so much now that i have left champaign .
best place to rent movies ever .
i miss you , rentertainment !
it 's the only home-video option in c-u for the non-brain dead crowd .
the most extensive selection of movies i 've ever seen at a rental place .
and the bluray section is fantastic !
they are sometimes friendly , sometimes rude , and always very slow .
i am a movie buff and this place has it all .
i love this place ten fold .
the place has the total package : rentertainment does and they are there to help .
the selection is huge .
here is a case where looks are deceiving .
it is impressive .
the staff are casual and nice .
at blockbuster or hollywood , i find that their service sucks .
at rentertainment you get caring people .
the rentals are very reasonably priced .
they offer packages and these packages offer killer savings .
they have a section for that .
puts facets to shame .
they seem to have everything .
secondly ... its pretty cheap if you buy a renters block .
best place to get movies in champaign , hands down .
it 's kind of like a physical version of netflix .
they have got everything .
the selection is magnificent and the community aspect is highly unique among video stores .
one of the best local rental places in the area i 've been too .
check this place out .
two yelp stars is expressed as `` meh .
i 've experienced better . ''
it 's old technology and it needs to die .
for champaign , these guys really have an outstanding collection of rare films .
in short more pros this store has the largest collection of tv-on-dvd ( my favorite section ! )
i 've ever seen .
they also have a large blu-ray section .
they are also the best value in town .
the have specials almost every day , and new releases are only $ _ num _ .
it 's a small space with dvds stacked floor to ceiling on every wall .
new releases and specials are easy to find in the front of the store .
however , the bulk of the collection are in tall , narrow aisles .
warning : the red meters are super-expensive and limited to _ num _ minutes !
there is no delivery option , and of course no instant-streaming option .
bottom line it 's simple to rent there and they always meet my needs .
with 35,000 + dvds , they have the best movie selection in town .
chambanites , you are lucky to have such a wonderful video rental store in-town .
rentertainment has a large and good selection of movies to choose from .
if you are desperate for the newest blockbuster , there is always redbox .
my advice is to sign up for a block and be bold .
if you rent movies from anywhere else , you suck .
we know you have a car , you lazy bastard .
they have nearly everything and the employees are extremely knowledgeable and personable !
champaign-urbana is lucky to have this place .
prices are reasonable and certain genres are discounted on certain days .
i hope this place sticks around for a long time !
i love the play on the name ... .
i think it is great .
we have visited them many times and feel comfortable with their level of service .
rentertainment is the best deal bar none .
they have nearly everything and the employees are extremely knowledgeable and personable !
i recommend buying a block .
that makes the price lower and you can keep the movie longer .
this place is amazing .
renting here kicks netflix 's ass if you 're on campus frequently .
i really miss having a place like this .
i 'm so glad this place is here !
this place is the best for rentals .
we are so lucky to have a place like this in town .
the people who work there are always nice .
that 's rentertainment is the obvious answer .
if you like foreign films there is no other place , period .
their selection in just about every genre is incredible .
staff is super cool and helpful .
get a block of _ num _ movies for $ _ num _ !
i appreciate your collection .
i love this place !
definitely recommending getting a block .
the staff are kind and helpful decent specials , but one of the more expensive bars on campus .
, the drinks are overpriced , and the place is always super packed .
one good thing is that the drinks are ridiculously cheap .
shots are $ _ num _ , pitchers can be as low as $ _ num _ .
hey girls - this review is written for you .
it 's not worth it .
great dance floor and quite amusing watching girls try to pole dance .
plus not a lot of college kids can drink dirty martinis nor order them .
being a grad student , i think the appeal is usually lost .
however it 's a lot trashier in quality than brother 's .
for traditional patties , you have to choose a 1/4 or 1/2 pound burger .
no thank you .
yikes ... they really need to improve their service .
second biggest problem is that nothing comes out at the same time .
also , between each visit from our waitress , there is a long wait .
it 's also unfortunate that their _ num _ bud light draft special was broken .
i 'm thoroughly disappointed .
they 've got some really great specials !
customer service is pretty lax , but not necessarily poor .
restrooms are clean ... enough .
drinks are reasonably priced .
service is decent .
this place is cavernous !
you can walk around in there and keep finding little niches to stand .
ample tvs for game watching and great college spirit .
this is one of my favorite bars on campus .
but only go there late if your planning on getting wild .
the drinks are mediocre .
where can i start with this place ?
it is the greatest creation ever .
this bar alone has changed humanity .
this is a great spot for lunch or early dinner .
the place gets super crowded and the music is deafening .
they 're alright .
i 'm guessing the grill just had n't been cleaned in a while ... if you want a good burger , go to seven saints or destihl .
this place feels just like your local frat house .
reviewing joe 's solely based on their food , which is surprisingly delicious .
i 've had most of the burgers without mushrooms .
like there are much worse things going on at this campus than this .
joe 's is soft .
high key soft for allowing this .
if your not _ num _ do n't even bother showing up .
it 's easy to get bored .
the service is incredible !
however , i 've still somehow gotten some awful haircuts in my tenure .
it 's always perfect , and she communicates really well .
that sucks .
she 's also really personable and knows all her customers by name .
i also have referred a few friends who also love debbie .
the hair salon next door , lando is a rip off .
overall , hb is great , even for guys .
they totally listen to your needs and you end up walking out feeling good .
the prices are reasonable for the area and service is great .
for a guys haircut , it is the perfect price for what i get .
it is quick too and i never wait long .
the stylists are nice and friendly .
she is a nice lady who knew what she was doing .
tracy is great !
great , helpful staff always makes you feel welcome .
very friendly service and everything is homemade on the premises .
mmmmmmm i love the cookie jar .
the regular cookies are also really good .
they always seem to be ever so slightly underdone , which i love .
the prices are reasonable and the staff is very friendly .
are they fancy and unique flavors likely to be featured in gourmet magazines ?
are they straight-up delicious ?
their cookies are delicious !
hands downs , best cookie is the buttercreme sandwich .
this place has the best cookies and customer service !
their staff is so nice and accommodating .
their cookies , all varieties , are absolutely amazing .
my favorite is the sugar cookie with icing .
the price is right and so is the location .
but their cookie is creamy and sweet .
the good : - the cookies are just delicious .
- the prices are reasonable .
- the service here is great .
the meh : more obvious signage may be beneficial .
ed is the nicest owner there is .
his cookie cakes are amazing .
and do n't even try the double doozies because you will be addicted .
great local place with great treats at great prices !
thank you cookie jar !
prices are very reasonable !
lots to choose from too !
cookies are awesome !
i love the peanut butter !
the rooms are big , so at first bromley felt like a good deal .
if your goal is to party constantly , this is your dorm .
made some great friends , many of which i still hangout with ... much better than she describes .
funny she also mentions the elevators .
those are some good stories : - ) maid service .
it can be good , it can be bad .
never attempt to order food for delivery from here .
there is much better drunk food .
there is much better sober food .
chipotle is better than this qdoba for fast food burritoes , i definitely choose qdoba over chipotle .
do yourself a favor and get something better .
qdoba is a pretty decent fast-food mexican place .
worse yet they keep very inconsistent hours when students are away .
also the lines at lunchtime can be ridiculous , which is sad .
it 's more expensive than taco bell and similar price to chipotle .
at least use a mixed cheese blend !
on top of that , their hours are all over the place .
chipotle is open more frequently .
it 's worth waiting in line at chipotle .
never any lines to worry about here !
not a smile to be found .
who 's in charge here ?
makes me wonder whether the meat is beyond its expiration date too .
an empty restaurant like qdoba speaks for itself .
i 've heard this same story from others .
evidently his time is much more important than mine .
i have brought both of my golden retrievers to this small grooming business .
no one does a better job on goldens , or loves dogs more !
now there is even no cigarette smoke .
both employees love dogs and are very friendly !
_ num _ stars really is more accurate ... the variety is amazing-the prices ... .
they tend to be a little high .
he has a great sensibility and i love the window displays !
i also love the location .
sometimes , they 're just not open when they 're supposed to be .
i really love this place .
sarah at hancock fabrics has been wonderful !
i really enjoy shopping there when she works there .
they outsource the repair to another company out in bloomington .
overall , the service is much there than at joanne !
if you can , check out hancock fabrics !
i regret chosing champaign dental group .
i have never heard of this .
this place is just alright .
she has a technique where the shots do not hurt too bad .
i usually have a problem with them billing my insurance as well .
like many other reviewers , i have suffered some bad experiences at champaign dental .
on a better note , the hygienist , mandi , is wonderful .
do n't trust this place .
i really enjoy the dental hygienist i see .
her technique is great , and my visits are quick and painless .
dr. kuo is great as well .
i am glad i checked with another dentist first !
do not go to champaign dental !
i hate going to the dentist , despise it even .
because of this latter fact , i have told all my coworkers about it !
definitely recommend !
nice staff and very helpful with getting me in fast and inexpensive .
this place is a scam .
it 's terrible .
shame on you , dr. colin !
as stated in other reviews these people are scam artists .
she proceeds to tell me that today 's visit is $ _ num _ .
_ num _ weeks later i 'm back to get the filling replaced .
she came back a minute later and said ok now i remember you .
i do n't even know where to begin .
keep in mind i have n't had a cavity since my baby teeth ... probably at least _ num _ years ago .
: ( do not go here !
stay away from these money hungry thieves !
funny because our insurance covers visits , and fillings !
stay away from these money hungry thieves !
funny because our insurance covers visits , and fillings !
do n't go here .
again only replying because they care about her teeth , lol !
horrible customer service and do not care about their patients .
all they care about is money and not the patient 's needs .
: ) grateful patients , the thomas family i wish i can give zero star !
i want to do once .
then they send bills later of the service date .
never ever go to this one !
it 's crispy and chewy and filled with yummy cheese .
they taste just like the ones at panda express .
over-all it was a pleasure to eat here and i will definetly go back !
my favorite chinese place to get lunch in champaign !
: ) i also really appreciate their service .
let me save you the trouble of coming here .
rainbow garden is basically all talk and no walk .
go to peking garden instead .
these guys at rainbow garden need to lighten up !
i dont know .
hungry enough for it again when i am in champaign ?
do n't believe some of the whiney reviewers on this site ... it 's a chinese restaurant for god 's sake !
inexpensive/plentiful lunch options and relatively quick delivery time make this an excellent choice .
i typically stick the chicken dishes , but the mooshu ( sp ? )
plates are amazing .
rg really cares about its customers .
rainbow garden is great for dining in or taking out .
the service is excellent and the food is always fantastic .
nice place have been back multiple times .
i 've ordered delivery from this place in the past .
i am surprised to enter a clean and quiet place .
you do n't see many places like that at asian restaurants .
my boyfriend and i have grown to have bigger appetite over the month .
: ) do n't get me wrong , their delivery service is fast and good also .
this food is legit .
i have always ordered delivery from here .
i usually never have anything to complain about because rainbow garden is great .
but , their owners/managers are always so angry for some reason .
this is not the way to handle customer service , people !
braised chicken/shrimp/whateverelse protein is always good .
try anything .
the service is rude here .
they are impersonal and impolite .
the food is ok , nothing outstanding but not horrible .
in short : food is decent but service is horrible .
it 's fairly reasonably priced , the decor is nice ( i.e .
the food was good , i suppose .
i wish they gave me some more rice though .
i like a lot of rice .
i have been going to this place for years .
i swear they have gotten even better recently .
i have had other things from here previously that i also really enjoyed .
the prices are reasonable and the delivery charge is understandable .
also the fact that they have online ordering now is a big plus .
we soooo over ordered .
we have at least two meals each to take home with us .
we order from here on a regular basis .
delivery is always very quick .
the restaurant is actually much bigger than you would perceive from the outside .
rainbow garden is solid and authentic .
you can tell that they care about presentation with regards to their dishes .
their menu is pretty unique and the house specials are delicious .
i have been ordering food from rainbow garden for ten years .
their food is delicious , it 's always hot , and delivery is fast !
rainbow garden is also a great spot for lunch .
but the food quality here is very good and everything tastes fresh .
i 'm a fan .
go there .
it 's a much more enjoyable experience than typical mid-west delivery ` chinese ' food .
look at your receipt !
the food quality is ok .
the price is never a problem for me to be honest .
the biggest problem is their service .
the staff there are rude and impolite .
take home : i 'll be trying out a new chinese place next time .
this place however always hits the spot for me .
though i think the atmosphere is very cozy and welcoming .
everything here is very clean as well .
quick service that is very friendly .
a large menu , and all is very well made and prepared .
i always love the dumplings ( how can anybody not love them ) .
the different types of pork , chicken , and beef are all excellent .
from sweet n sour to bbq or stir fry .
though the gekkeikan plum wine is amazing .
i like the place for the atmosphere and of course the food .
i always order sizzler beef which it 's good .
has authentic stuff and americanized stuff like orange chicken too .
we love rainbow garden !
the food is a bit high-priced but it is worth it .
the food is n't greasy at all and the flavor is excellent .
worth a try if you have n't already .
the portions are generous and the food is tasty .
i 'm giving this place _ num _ stars .
the only down side is that i do n't get to champaign often enough .
how do you mess up a fried rice ?
the food is also pretty good and the portions are on the larger side .
the delivery speed is pretty fast , around _ num _ minutes .
she 's pretty happy with both the quality and the quantity of the food .
* for good drinks * for good shows * * for awesome outdoor seating cowboy monkey is a fairly nice bar in downtown champaign .
in the winter it kind of sucks because the indoor seating is fairly limited .
and thats only in the summer .
the kitchen is closed in the winter months .
cowboy monkey tries a bit too hard .
and on friday nights is absolutely infested with frat bros. wtf .
how can you not serve food after midnight ?
geez , alcohol makes me so hungry !
you lose , buddy .
also , let me point out that the dj kind of sucks .
anyways , have fun in your own way .
this is a review for their sunday night trivia .
the beer specials are pretty good , i have to give them that .
trivia is a cross between the way boltini 's and canopy does it .
_ num _ max per team ; you pick your team name .
there are breaks for bathroom etc .
the format needs significant tweaking .
the first question of each round is worth _ num _ and the last _ num _ points .
this problem is compounded as points rack up for the final calculation .
also , the strict adherence to narrow categories does n't work .
the food here is excellent .
they open just in time for ebertfest at the end of april .
i 'm still out $ _ num _ to them , three days later .
so , i 'm not too pleased with the place .
they 've also started sunday night trivia which has become a big hit .
definitely worth checking out !
to top off our bad experience , this place steals your money .
that is not ok !
i 'm not .
it 's crowded .
the service sucks .
the drinks are watery .
the food is just ... .
and it 's loud .
that ship has sailed .
it 's not though .
now i avoid it like that plague .
love the salsa dancing here !
cowboy monkey is a solidly mediocre bar .
the liquor and beer selection is about average for champaign .
as long as i 'm griping , i want to mention the bathrooms .
fix your locks , cheapskates .
also during this time the food is great !
trivia is fun on sunday 's with dave .
great food & patio cowboy ... thank you for being free entry .
thanks derek !
great staff rad stage , fun bartenders , vegan options , all you can eat chips and salsa , outdoor seating , it 's perfect rock n roll club !
they have a huge drink menu .
definitely an amazing patio situation happening .
the weak bit is their food .
food is always consistent and tastes well .
beware things can be a bit spicy .
the waitresses on the other hand are not good .
patio atmosphere is nice but music tends to be a bit too loud .
outdoor seating is awesome !
food is yummy .
can be spicy .
my friends love the bean dip .
servers can be on the slow side .
however , emily is an excellent server .
the rounds are weighted from very easy to impossible .
some of the general knowledge trivia is so random .
there is no way you can really study for trivia .
the special on sundays is $ _ num _ nachos .
come here for drinks , do not stay for the food .
not kidding .
reminds me of home .
this is how an asian super-market should be .
am-ko is the best !
they have produce though , too , and it 's very affordable .
first of all , am-ko is huge for an ethnic shop in the midwest .
there is also a moderately-sized selection of kitchen and grooming/beauty supplies .
i remember going to am-ko as a kid .
but it appears the ownership has very recently changed ?
no one appears to be the same staff as little as a month ago .
does anyone know what happened to the great owners ?
am-ko definitely has a lot of asian goods .
this is definitely the place to go if you need anything asian in champaign !
the whole place is cleaner and brighter than the other oriental stores around town .
prices are fair .
they have some great harder-to-find packaged items ( melon bars - yes , please ! )
produce is limited , but dry goods are extensive .
what i ca n't find here i get at the green onion .
it feels like real market .
some of the prices are absolute bargain/basement .
great place to pick up some loose green tea and all of the accoutrements .
i deduct a star because of the lack of anything fresh .
fresh vegetable section is very limited .
fresh anything is very limited .
well , i am pretty sure that is what i bought .
i read it burns fat .
we shall see : i already need to go get more .
they keep the coffee candy right next to the register .
i love the ginseng root in a cute little bottle .
we are accustomed to long grain .
i like all the bulk grains and the flours .
this store is cramped in a lot of good ways .
there is some serious inventory in here .
worth checking out for sure if you have n't .
you need chinese rice vinegar ?
honestly ... do n't go here .
i can understand having a bad day , but that woman is just terrible .
the store itself is not the worst but it seems a little dirty .
they have a good selection so i ca n't complain about that .
in my opinion , make the trip to green onion instead .
it 's cleaner and they 're much nicer .
has some good drinks and snacks .
literally the best place for students and locals who want diversity in their food .
they also sell henna here !
there is a halal meat section in the back corner freezer .
do your research and know what you 're trying to buy !
to get there , simply take the _ num _ teal .
it 's just down the street from the stop at first and white .
i 'm so glad that this place exists !
the lady working this place is very ignorant and rude !
they 're so overprice and the produce is not good !
there 's nothing good in here .
go to other asian stores cause this one will waste your time .
a note to the management of the hawthorn suites : _ num _ a half wall and a love seat do not a `` suite '' make _ num _ let 's step into the 21st century : some wireless please _ num _ women like conditioner and lotion .
why are hotels still using this `` conditioning '' shampoo crap ?
most half decent hotels have upgraded to down comforters .
they are warmer , more washable , and generally less gross .
please do n't send housekeeping around knocking on doors at _ num _ and 8:30 .
first of all 2x is unnecessary .
second of all , some people are jet lagged .
thank you .
_ num _ a curved shower curtain bar does not make it a bigger shower .
thank you , hawthorn suites , for the following : _ num _ awesome breakfast ( omelet bar ?
_ num _ plug in for my ipod in the clock radio _ num _ being so kind as to hold my fedex boxes for me .
for my money the hampton inn is a better hotel .
there is a lot behind the hotel and across the street .
not a big deal , but i 'm lazy .
there 's a lovely tgi fridays right next door , so that was convenient .
it 's an indoor version of your average best western motel .
the bathroom is incredibly tiny .
and what the hell is up with the water pressure ?
hawthorn suites is a total has-been on the champaign hotel scene .
the interior is still tired looking .
now , i think it 's probably the best hotel in champaign .
everyone there is super friendly and i think it 's gotten a lot nicer !
the rooms are dated , and the layout pushes the definition of suite .
sure enough , it rotates .
just a little over a mile , i think .
very doable if you 're in decent shoes !
think new carpet , wall paper , drapes and furniture .
bad news is they still do n't do very well with hot water .
the bathroom is still small and there is limited counter top space .
but a wonderful new thing to brag about .
i have never noticed this in any other hotel .
but , as others have said , space is limited .
seating is very limited given the size of the hotel .
finally , the wifi is slow but constant .
make sure to have the free amazing breakfast !
there is an omelet chef making you the omelet your way !
the most gross place i 've ever stayed .
do they even clean the room ?
there 's a thief working here !
breakfast is great !
it goes to and from the airport .
within walking distance to many restaurants .
staff is friendly & polite .
complimentary breakfast is 2nd to none .
the core infrastructure is not good .
if someone wants to get up and get ready , everyone is waking up .
door is in the middle of the entry wall so very inefficient layout .
finish line , you stink .
seems like i am not the only one .
the store just sucks .
love love love this place .
favorites are the honey whole wheat , the cheddar garlic , and anything apple .
i love the scones .
but they sure are yummy .
also love the make-your-own sandwich option .
this is the best ever !
i hope you can visit soon and often you wo n't be disappointed .
it is truly one of a kind place .
these loaves are neither .
and for making real bread .
their breads are all heavy and thick .
the honey whole wheat is perfect toasted , and their apple breads are amazing .
you can also call ahead orders so you wo n't miss out .
how can i not love a place that supports local running ?
even with that bit of business , i stinkin ' love this place .
it 's great stuff .
bread here is sinful .
it 's a bakery that makes some sandwiches .
they have homemade jams and nut butters , fresh bread daily .
the offer samples of their bread while you take a look around .
it 's wonderful and fresh .
the occasional specialty breads are to die for .
they now offer sandwiches to go , but i have n't yet tried one .
their whole wheat breads are especially superior -- chewy and richly flavored .
their white breads and challah are good , too .
i 've even tried their carb control bread .
great harvest bread company is one of our local treasures .
they offer you slices of bread to try .
they have jelly 's , spread , breads , sandwiches , salads and soups .
not cheap but taste good .
food is great !
bread is awesome !
staff is friendly !
keep up the great work .
excellent place to grab lunch .
reminds me of southport avenue in chicago .
anyway , you order your food to the bartenders .
i do n't like the idea .
to be honest , i dod n't like either of them .
a juicy pizza is not my favorite .
i 'm not against non-american-style thin crust pizzas .
as a matter of fact , i love jupiter 's pizzas .
what the hell , it 's a great dive bar .
i cant ' even hate on it .
peanuts in the shell , eat them and throw the shells on the floor .
just your basic , no frills , hang out with your buddies , bar .
there 's decent pub food .
when the weather is good , there 's outdoor patio seating .
the place is dirt cheap and the food is simple and good .
also , they have a number of large pool tables .
i love this place so much ... it 's my favorite bar in town .
it 's a great bar with a great drink selection .
she is the owner 's daughter ! ''
my fianc and i go here all of the time and love it .
it is a great bar for relaxing and enjoying some cheap drinks .
the food is typical bar food , but is also priced right .
esquire pretty much kicks ass .
i mean hardcore !
esquire is awesome !
the staff is extremely friendly and attentive .
the food is cheap and is great , drunk or sober .
i recommend the asian dumplings , or a burger .
their contusions are amazing ( pineapple infused tequila ) !
but i guess that just goes to show the people that frequent esquire .
in general , the crowd is older , and everyone seem to be regulars .
this place is right across the street from the station .
the cheap food and beer is an added bonus .
love love love this place .
or that you simply spit the peanut shells out on the floor ?
yeah , it 's that type of place ... .
i love it .
and i also love their special pineapple-induced tequila .
to die for .
what have i been doing with my life ?
i am regretting all the times i went to campus bars .
what is not to love ?
i love free peanuts .
but so far , all systems go .
the burgers are some of the best in champaign .
the pizza is good and comes in a number of varieties .
the one complaint i have is that the service can be especially hit-and-miss .
overall , esquire is a down-to-earth place with good prices and good food .
i 'm liking this spot !
music low enough to hold conversation if so inclined .
not a shit-ton of kids ( undergrads ) around to annoy .
good spot to get your grown-folks drink on .
three pints of pbr under _ num _ bucks for the win !
that said , we opt for better food in the downtown area .
the portobello mushroom sandwich is delicious .
food here is just fine , and very reasonably priced .
the gross looking jar on the bar is infused vodka .
service is always friendly , and fastest at the bar .
you can order lunch ahead and pick up _ num _ minutes later .
of course , that 's just fine with me .
this is the first bar i visited when i moved here five years ago .
it 's a good place , even taking none of the above into account .
the people who frequent this place are an interesting mix .
great food , great drinks , and a great place to just hang out .
lots of friendly regulars hanging out at the bar !
i have never been to a place where it felt so comfortable .
they have free peanuts and the atmosphere is great .
service and atmosphere is the best part of the place .
i 've been going to the esquire for over _ num _ years .
it 's because they have great drinks , delicious food and efficient friendly staff .
i tried their fried broccoli recently , it 's soooo addicting .
the main problem is that it does n't have great beer .
it 's a fairly versatile place , good for happy hours .
i go to this bar every single time i 'm in champaign .
just make sure you have your id because they will card you !
update : the jukebox is now gone .
i am not happy .
ruthie aw harper ( unregistered ) says : ladyluv the place where everyone feels @ home ... surprisingly good bar food .
nostalgia gets me every time .
the decor is uninteresting at best .
there is no personality .
i 'm not entirely sure why , as this makes an awkward eating experience .
thank goodness for mayonaise .
give me some salty peanuts , pbr and mediterranean pizza from the esquire anytime !
honestly do n't know how this place is still in business .
yeah , it 's that bad .
i have dietary restrictions and i need to be picky .
esquire is definitely a place to be visited when in champaign !
mmm ok - it 's actually more of a watering hole .
i do n't remember my first visit to the esquire .
i suspect i 'm not alone , but my reasons probably differ .
luckily for me , i have been to esquire many more times since .
it 's all about the ambiance , really .
then stomp on all the peanut shells on the floor .
i have seen expansion many times .
it is safe to say my family has a mullti generational history here .
just a great place to relax and have a few drinks .
along with the evolution of the bar , so has the menu .
which i do n't think are that great .
though the various pizzas are very good .
as are the wings , which i am not typically a fan of .
the asian dumplings are great as well .
the service can be hit or miss .
depending on the time you come , and where you order .
drinks are pretty standard .
there are a handful of good micros on tap .
the rest is typical drinks for a neighborhood bar .
i eat here at least _ num _ times a week .
they 're to die for , and often the only thing i order here .
otherwise , the spirits and beer selections are okay .
the pool space is nice and open as well .
the food , on the other hand , has been consistently underwhelming .
plus food normally takes forever to come out of the oven .
in short , come for the booze , but eat beforehand .
coming from california , these are the cheapest drinks i 've ever encountered !
there are fun pool tables and other arcade games .
this place seems to be a staple of downtown champaign .
beer selection is good .
easy to get to .
food is ok .
salmon is awesome .
there 's something quite nice about this place .
every pizza i 've had here has been really delicious .
but the bathrooms ... avoid the bathrooms .
that being said , there is a nice energy throughout .
staff is great and service is prompt and friendly .
i do n't know why i bothered trying a second time .
so my main complaint about the lunch dining experience is sanitation .
wash your hands if you still decide to go .
the thin crust pizza is delicious .
when i hear the word `` esquire , '' i think formal and gentlemen .
despite this , this place features some cool billiards .
i 've never left disappointed !
because , really , they have everything here at the esquire .
i feel like a rebel for making a mess , hehe . )
will definitely be back next time i 'm visiting champaign their pizzas are pretty good -- thin crust .
get the bbq chicken .
the food is n't amazing but it 's pretty good for a lounge/bar .
i 've tried their sandwich as well with pulled pork .
apparently they have a buffet lunch or something .
cool , chill place to check out in downtown champaign .
quick , concerned , , really knows how to make money !
let 's you drink a little before .
killing u with ordering .
she is awesome !
esquire is rather hideous with an atmosphere not to my taste .
okay , that 's not a big deal .
i guess i 'm just not used to this feel .
i personally think their drink menu is shot .
do n't come out to the esquire and not try this pizza !
you all have lint butt .
do n't expect fancy .
they have a surprisingly good beer selection and infuse their own liquors .
literally what it 's advertised as .
this place is great for what it is .
cheap food , cheap beer and alcohol ( hefty wine pours ! )
i go here whenever i 'm downtown and need smokes .
they are $ _ num _ , but it 's right there .
but is it really settling on esquire ?
the cheese sticks here are some of the best in town .
the asian dumplings are what makes me eat here .
do n't know why , but they are awesome .
she gets a grilled cheese .
i get the ribeye steak sammich .
it 's definitely a serviceable ribeye steak sammich .
the grilled cheese is a grilled cheese .
they have triptych pretty nice little saturday on tap .
they always have pnls on tap .
within the past _ num _ years , their craft beer selection has vastly improved .
that 's probably to the dismay of several of their regulars .
esquire is the townie bar downtown .
it probably has the most eclectic mix of people .
after sporting events , the place is almost all orange on the inside .
not too many other bars downtown are that sports friendly .
it 's a comfort bar .
even though the chairs are n't that comfortable .
there 's pool .
there 's peanuts .
for a bar food bar , their pizza is ridiculously good .
try the blue pear ( warning , no red sauce ) .
crooked tree is always on tap !
cause the food is n't free ?
this is one of my favorite spots in champaign .
if you like tomato soup , you have to come here .
they have a tomato bisque soup that is incredible !
definitely a most go to place esquire is one of those bars that definitely grew on me .
there is always seating because this place is huge including an outdoor patio area .
i believe in you esquire .
thank you for not letting me down .
the food is typical casual american fare , but the quality meets the prices .
service can be a bit snarky at times , though .
i love jupiter 's pizza .
lots of good drinks to be had .
lots of pool to be played .
every time i go the service is horrendous .
i like the smoked salmon .
that is tragic .
however , if you like pool , these are very good tables .
this is a great stop towards the end of the night .
great place to play pool .
some of the best thin crust i think i have had .
bar is nice and roomy , good place to play pool .
sadly many do n't make this transition .
perfect for watching sports and playing pub games .
pizza is great , thin crust .
beer selection is so-so .
this place is a great place to grab a thin crust pizza with friends .
we are regulars , especially at their new location !
more seating !
jupiters is great !
i am still a fan .
this is the 2nd time i had to post a review of jupiters .
i wish we had a jupiters or equivalent in california .
my favorite is their sausage , schroom , bell pepper and onion pizza .
i hope yelp does n't take this review down this time .
you win , jupiters .
happy hour special providing me with cheap yet delicious beer ?
super cheap pizza , making life amazing ?
okay , jupiter 's has happy hour specials that are wondrous .
i always make a stop here whenever i 'm in town .
a perfect place to grab a bite with an old friend .
daily drink specials ( and the beer is always cheap ) .
i love their pizza menu .
i think the environment is a lot of fun also .
the price is fair .
it 's _ num _ for a personal pizza which a good size !
i 'm looking forward to coming back !
amaaazing pizza !
the bianca is totally my jam .
they also have drink specials just about every night .
service is also solid too !
i like this place .
i stick to the basics , and they do that just fine .
great place to drink some beers and eat pizza .
jupiter 's pizza is awesome .
they also have pool tables and arcade games .
jupiter 's specialty pizzas are great !
more importantly , the price is very reasonable .
also this place has a clean , friendly , fun atmosphere .
it 's definitely one of my favorite places to go in downtown champaign .
after 10 pm , a large two topping pizza is $ _ num _ .
pizza is way overpriced .
if you like pizza bites , well heck , then dig in .
not only that , but food takes forever to come out .
it 's too small to be able to really play .
the place is plenty big , so it does n't get too loud .
pool tables are in good shape which is nice for a bar .
do n't really have to wait to long to get a pool table one of the best bar/restaurants i 've been to in champaign !
the pizza is cooked perfect , priced right , and served piping hott !
bartenders are super friendly and serve up awesome drinks at great prices !
pizza is served california pizza kitchen-style .
some people play pool during lunch .
do n't play pool unless you 're at brother 's .
so much to do , so little time .
pizzas are solid .
hawaiian is my go to .
they just get it perfect every time .
the decor is nice and makes for a nice ambiance .
pool tables are some of the best in town .
overall great local place to go .
another institution in downtown champaign that has been here forever .
the bar area is nice with a few tables and big booths .
there is not a lot of sitting area if you come at peak hours .
so be warned .
there is even a patio out back .
the building itself is ancient , and tons of character .
the servers work hard , and are very friendly .
though can get swamped during peak hours .
the pizzas are great .
crispy , thin crust that is awesome .
the specialty pizzas like pizza pesto is great .
they come in personal , _ num _ '' , and _ num _ . ''
: ( but staff are usually friendly .
it 's thing crust with nice crunch .
so a large probably feeds _ num _ people comfortably , _ num _ uncomfortably .
minor inconvenience though so it 's whatever .
prices arent bad !
i like to make my own pizza ... cream sauce , tomatoes , spinach , mushrooms and cheese !
there are plenty of billiards tables in the summer when the students are gone .
okay , i tend to write about places that i like .
maybe it is on busy days ?
definitely on my list to recommend to others .
the thin-crust pizza is fantastic , and reasonably priced .
_ num _ things i love .
and this place has both .
but they probably have the rudest waitress in champaign .
the other jupiters location is much better as a restaurant .
very basic and not really fun as an adult to play .
pizza is soso and pricy .
be forewarned .
it 's cracker crust pizza .
but of course , this also sounds like a pretty horrible idea .
i have no idea what 's good about this .
oh , does n't lunchables do a a pizza lunch ?
there you go , it 's kind of like that .
so that 's your atmosphere .
epic fail on their part , last time i go to that dive .
if thin crust is your thing , this place is hard to beat .
however , i think it 's pretty hard to go wrong at jupiter 's .
if not , possibly pick up ?
i do commend their varying selection of toppings for their pizza .
i recommend the prosciutto di parma pizza and the bbq chicken pizza .
yummyyyy jupiter 's is a great place for any crowd of people .
they also have about _ num _ pool tables where you can enjoy a few games .
their pizza is very good .
they 're famous for their thing sliced pizza .
they have an unlimited selection of toppings and sauces .
they also run great deals like half price large pizzas on tuesdays .
my only complaint about this place is the speed of service .
the pool rates are inexpensive at only $ _ num _ per hour .
the atmosphere is generally good .
they have the best pizza !
they are the thinnest crispy pizza .
we go to tuesday 's half off pizza day .
this is my favorite thin crust pizza in the area .
the place is almost always empty so the service is pretty quick .
even after an early football game , we get fed pretty quickly .
it makes a good lunch spot after church too !
what 's not to love ?
what does , though , is their service .
it offers some great entertainment , with some good refreshment ( albeit expensive !
the atmosphere is also very nice .
it 's clean as well .
but the pizza is much too small for the price .
maybe someone with a normal sized appetite can chime in .
update : i think i found out why i thought it was overpriced .
here 's the link to their menu with the prices : http : / / www.jupiterspizza.com/downtown/menu.html i got a custom 4-topping personal which should have been about $ _ num _ tops .
just not cool .
but jupiter 's food is not good enough to justify capricious pricing .
yet if you want super , super thin pizza , it is delicious !
i think tuesday nights are half off , so it is so worth it .
the pizzas are tasty , a good offering for a thin-crust style .
my favorites are the preferito and bbq chicken .
and guess what ?
thank you so much for such an awesome service and good food !
how have i not yet reviewed this place ?
sign says : seat yourself .
difficult to do when there are no tables available .
hard to get service .
a very quick , painless and easy place to get your foid card .
thumbs down this place charges a fee of $ _ num _ to do basically nothing .
this place is foolish and should not exist as a business .
the time it takes for them to process the paper work is ridiculous .
avoid !
i call beck 's my little hidden gem in c-u .
the staff is quick & courteous .
this place is ridiculous .
i absolutely recommend this place !
plus they have an $ _ num _ special every tuesday !
they do a great job and i have no complaints .
keep up the great work .
great stylist , they know their stuff .
very affordable and stylist keep up with trends .
this location is awesome .
the people are always friendly and stephanie is very skilled .
not only is she friendly and talented , she is efficient !
i am so thankful i found her !
the staff always seem to enjoy their job .
they are very friendly and hospitable the moment you walk in the door .
you do n't necessarily need an appointment , but i recommend calling before going .
i want to cry because my hair was so ugly !
do yourself a huge favor and look elsewhere .
i have to find a new apartment with little notice .
do n't do it .
actually i do not even want to give one start for this place .
please do yourself a favour and look somewhere else .
have lived in apartment in so many states and they are the worst .
bacaro ( pronounced bah-kah-roh ' ) is a trendy little ultra-modern wine bar .
the food is largely excellent , though portions are modest .
and prices are rather reasonable , though not great .
one of the few places in champaign to test your palette .
the food is rather smart and inventive .
the interior is very reminiscent of blackbird in chicago .
the food is really good and the interior is very stylish .
also , the service is great .
food items are less adventurous and price point has increased with time .
service i have always found to be very good and knowledgeable , esp .
just because we are students does n't mean we do n't deserve good food .
i 've had fantastic entrees for less at other places in cu .
i have never ever had a bad dish here .
they seem to be particular to detail , which is a plus to me !
the wine is top notch too .
you pay for what you get .
i think i need to save to go there again , so worth it !
until then , i say stick with radio maria .
seriously ... i 'm still salivating thinking about it .
as bacaro is also a wine lounge , their wine selection is quite extensive .
i think the wine here is better .
i have to come back here to try more of their wines .
i think it 's probably better to come here just for wine than for dinner and like what everyone else said , the service was great !
the restaurant is n't very big , the decor is modern .
this place is amazing .
i 've only been their twice since each meal costs half a months rent .
it 's totally worth it though .
another plus is they serve french press coffee !
the waitstaff all seems super nice , and well-informed about the menu .
i want to try dinner here too but have n't been that adventurous .
if you want ribeye , go to jim gould 's .
their mashed potatoes were very much like the kind you make from a box .
it is also so small .
i ca n't help but feel this restaurant has fooled many .
i 've been to italy , and this is n't italian ... i suppose the entire visit was lackluster .
who orders a double merlot ?
i am trying to think of what to add that has n't been said ... i think this is one of the outstanding restaurants in champaign-urbana .
overall , they rock .
this is not the typical `` american-italian '' restaurant .
this is not an all-you-can eat for cheap place .
prices reflect the cost of quality ingredients and a skilled staff .
there 's a nice wine list that favors italian varieties .
the staff can make good recommendations .
i have to save a star ; there are better restaurants in the world .
what do all of these places have in common ?
bacaro does not cut corners where quality is concerned .
enjoy .
on to the wine , which is my favorite subject .
cu deserves more than jameson and pbr .
if not , i recommend you head straight to www.steaknshake.com it is very inexpensive and has very large portions .
enjoy !
i do n't see what all the fuss is about .
not rushing back any time soon .
very impressive , even for this guy who lives and eats in downtown chicago .
i may be a cynic , but it raises red flags ... .
i am very forgiving of servers too , being a former one myself .
my only complaint with bacaro is the service .
bacaro has been through some subtle but incredibly effective changes .
nice , elegant , cozy place to dine .
i eat out a lot , and i always look forward to eating here .
i also like that the menu is never the same twice .
i like the decor .
small menu , but you end up wanting everything on it .
hmmm , what to say , what to say .
no thank you .
tranquil , calm and romantic wine bar is pretty decent and deserts taste good .
here 's what we ordered : grilled veal chop with red beets and pearl onions apple cake with creme fraiche ice cream chocolate brownie with graham cracker ice cream and roasted marshmallows persimmon and pistachio bread pudding it was just plain soggy and tasteless .
i recommend not ordering dessert here if you do plan on coming .
of course it is pricey but it is worth it .
pretty good food but a bit pricey for what you get .
at least i hope she was new .
this is no time for creativity .
the dessert menu is stupid .
who follows octopus and rabbit with banana bread and ice cream ?
hire a dessert chef .
sometimes i do .
sometimes i have parents who need impressing .
this is , hands down , the best restaurant in champaign right now .
way to go bacaro !
hopefully they do n't do that anymore .
since then i move to stockholm and then new york city .
champaign-urbana has fantastic terroir .
this is a very good place to eat in the champaign area .
this is our favorite restaurant in champaign-urbana .
the desserts truly capture the seasons and the feel of the weather so perfectly .
i honestly do n't know a better way to start the week !
and i have never been disappointed .
the service is great , and they are very attentive .
i think you definitely get what you pay for .
and for a city like champaign , bacaro is definitely a lovely gem .
it is a beautiful , modern looking restaurant .
i 'm sure she was one tired girl by the end of the evening .
that 's the kind of dinner my husband had at bacaro .
for champaign , this is the best food around .
the monday arket menu is a great price too .
the staff is not pretentious which is always nice to see .
this is a diamond in the c-u rough .
overall , it is a consistently good restaurant in terms of service .
however , there are certain dishes that are more tasty than others .
quality and kind ... just the kind of service we adore .
i 'm not a `` foody '' but i adore good food .
i 'm not sure if we failed to describe what we wanted .
this is such a minor point though .
i wish i could give bacaro five stars .
to be fair , there 's a lot to like about it .
the quality of the ingredients is high .
the ambience is great too .
the servers are among the most professional in the c-u area .
the food is genuinely sophisticated .
the menu at bacaro is constantly changing based on what ingredients they stock .
this tends to result in inconsistent dishes whose preparations are constantly changing .
of three visits i 've eaten some bad , ok and great meals .
over-priced food where _ num _ and _ num _ year old townies and professors eat .
you 've been warned .
the atmosphere is great , but the food is too buttery and overpriced .
i wish i could take this restaurant with me on the road .
the grilled octopus salad is a must .
portions are not huge , but adequate .
in my party , one person have the ribeye .
this is easily one of my most memorable and favorite dining experiences .
i am from dallas and in champaign for business .
this is the perfect place to stop in after a long day of visiting family and friends .
not too noisy , good food , and any beverage you like .
next time i think i will budget my stomach space and leave some room for bacaro .
wine is half price on sundays by the way !
this is champaign 's version of a manhattan bistro .
this is our favorite restaurant in champaign , hands down the best food .
bacaro 's cuisine is innovative and delicious !
appropriate proportions are creatively presented .
the service and ambiance are the tops !
great people watching can be had on their outdoor terrace .
say what ?
i believe your customers are your priority !
i always love bacaro !
the wine is half price on sundays so i had _ num _ glasses .
i remember the pumpkin ravioli being delicious and the waiter service being great .
portions are relatively small , though .
i love that they use local ingredients and keep their menu small and creative .
say what ?
i believe your customers are your priority !
just wanted to post an update .
again - the food is amazing and we want to see them succeed .
so here is my take .
wait staff 3-4 stars atmosphere 4-5 stars wine list 4-5 stars beer list 3-4 stars menu 4-5 stars food 2-3 stars unfortunately bacaro is not one of those places .
my recommendation is avoid because there is way too much attitude here .
we 've never had a bad meal at bacaro .
a good restaurant is not just about food , but also about ambience .
enjoy !
i 've taken my wife here on two occasions .
yeah ... so what , i have only eaten here twice .
staff is awesome , all of them .
this is a comfortable yummy spot .
: ) first , i love the extensive wine selection !
their bottle selection is really impressive .
the overall ambiance is beautiful , altho it was a tad bit loud .
overall , definitely recommend it for a romantic date night .
the best restaurant in champaign-urbana if you do n't mind the price .
this review is extra late .
i do n't remember which wine it was since this was so long ago .
there are not a lot of really nice dinning restaurants in champaign .
the menu is seasonal and changes at least _ num _ times per year .
wonderful combinations of local ingredients ; menu evolves with availability .
sunday 1/2 price wine by the glass is a great deal .
loved bacaro before , love them even more now .
the farm to table cousine is perfectly prepared .
this is a prime example of `` you get what you pay for '' .
cocktails are consistently delicious and the wine recommendations are excellent .
$ _ num _ including a drink .
get over there and give it a try .
this restaurant is sort of hit and miss .
i have had some really spectacular pasta with sea urchin .
otherwise , there are restaurants that offer greater value and dining experience in chambana .
chef morrow uses locally grown fresh veggies + herbs in his wonderful menus .
thank you to everyone on the staff for a lovely evening .
you pay quite a premium for the dish that are notably small .
pros : local sustained food , changing menu hidden deals : the wine menu was large and the waiter was very attentive .
which is pricewise on the high side .
i just am not super impressed with the portions or the prices .
not sure what they consider booked .
it is velvety smooth .
bacaro is definitely the place to treat yourself , which never disappoints .
rotating menu with wine recommendations .
the atmosphere is good and the service is excellent .
it 's a place where dining is an experience .
the ambiance and atmosphere is very good .
planning to have a dinner or brunch there .
can wait to go again and try more great food !
this is champaign , a small but charming place in central illinois .
this place is one of our favorite places to eat !
it is hard to find a restaurant that cares this much about it customers !
i can not wait to go back again .
awesome spot to go if you want something a little more intimate and quiet .
good spot to bring a date .
the food comes slow on purpose .
abandon any thought of _ num _ hour meal .
the proportions are n't `` central illinois '' they are regular heathy proportions .
slow down and enjoy the experience .
bring your rich relatives or boss who will pay .
menu is comprehensive .
overall one of the best dinning experiences i have in recent memory .
dining in champaign has come a long way since i went to school here .
kind of hard to explain .
radio maria has great and unique food !
the selection of wines is excellent as well !
has a really nice atmosphere .
i still crave the beer bread .
and the masa boat the interior is so artfully done .
i 'm not a big fan of being uncomfortable ... ever .
the interior is very well done for that particular genre .
the food , eh , nothing to write home about .
radio maria is at the top of the restaurant heap in chambana for dinner .
have n't been for lunch and i have n't experienced the tapas yet .
i love the atmosphere because it is understated and eclectic at the same time .
the radio hostess stand is lovely .
and i 'm a sucker for their crass-esque vintage graphic design .
the reisling and gewuiztraminer are my favorites .
the service has always been friendly without being intrusive .
my food has always been cooked perfectly .
i 'm starting to think these guys spread themselves a bit too thin .
what , you want me to do work ? ''
radio maria is a vast improvement .
in fact , we love tapas .
and their prices are extremely reasonable .
i do n't even know what i 'm supposed to review here .
is it a restaurant ?
and what 's with this sunday comfort food menu ?
do they even know anymore ?
i almost feel bad giving this jack of all trades only three stars .
but then there 's nothing about this place that 's outright great , either .
now , the new tapas bar i like quite a bit .
both spaces are nice - they are adjacent to each other .
radio maria is definitely one of the nicest dining options in downtown champaign .
they also usually have a bunch specials , which i would recommend trying .
the service has also always been good .
i always get an omelette , which i always enjoy .
overall though , radio maria is not to be missed .
this place keeps getting better and better .
you can come here anytime at all and find something that suits your palette .
to sum it all up : * drooool * .
her praise hits often and reaches far .
radio maria makes me feel good .
service at rm is impeccable .
their knowledgeable sommelier staff are very helpful for beginners and experienced wine-drinkers alike .
always order the special , their young , fashionable chefs always deliver .
after all , they have awesome sangria and great sunday brunch .
the tapas also taste great , but they always make me terribly sick afterward .
please , radio maria owners , read these reviews and take corrective action !
do not rest on your laurels because that way failure lies ... everything becomes a mish-mash and it 's overwhelming and nothing stands out .
also , the pretty pretty people who work there do n't like kids .
the restaurant itself is still lovely .
love this place , always have .
one of the few restaurants that is consistently different .
i am not impressed with this place .
my friend and i walk into the bar side for tapas .
sure , we walk past several empty tables and sit at the empty bar .
and keeps walking by .
maybe i just expect more .
who knows .
how does one make cake taste like deli meat ?
i have no idea .
i ask for the check .
i do n't know if i would recommend this place .
maybe once just to go ... but i think once is enough .
the restaurant scene here has improved phenomenally .
check it out if you 're in town .
not very unique but good eats .
also , their drinks are marvelous .
this place is honestly a world class spanish food/tapas place .
radio maria is my favorite restaurant in champaign .
the food is top-notch and the atmosphere is one of a kind .
normally the value/price ratio is excellent .
one caveat is that the portions are rather small .
menu advertises : `` tastes like a cookie '' .
ok i 'm in the mood for sweet .
me : can i trade this for something else ?
it 's really not good .
bartender _ num _ : what do you mean ?
bartender _ num _ : what is going on here .
bartender _ num _ : the menu says `` tastes like a cookie '' me : it tastes like robitussin .
have you tried it .
it 's not like we can serve it to someone else .
this beer tastes like robitussin ; how wrong do you have to get ?
if you want differential treatment , go here .
wine and beer list is plenty long and varied - flavors for everyone .
outside tables are great on a warm summer evening .
agree with 3 + stars .
some restaurants in this area have chicago-envy .
dishes are overly complex and are either bland or actively taste bad .
i have no idea what 's going on now .
ground coffee rubs .
stay away !
the food is good quality , and the flavor always delicious !
the desserts i 've had are lovely ; with good flavor and pretty presentation .
note : many people have reviewed radio maria negatively .
i think they need to put it in context of local restaurants .
we 're in champaign-urbana , not new york or seattle .
i also think they need to stop being so negative .
$ _ num _ to get in and then salsa dancing all night !
there 's a full bar if you get thirsty and two dance floors .
in the meantime , check it out on a friday or a saturday night !
radio maria has nice decor and an interesting menu .
my only complaint is that the service was painfully slow .
ok , first , we have to discuss the breakfast potatoes .
are so unreasonably delicious .
for this , it gets at least one more star to land at _ num _ .
but sure enough , _ num _ minutes later all our food arrives at once .
that 's a shame .
i 've been here _ num _ times , mostly for brunch .
the waiters are my least favorite part of radio maria .
there are never enough people working at brunch .
oh radio maria , how i wish we could be in love .
radio maria is like the girl your friends try to set you up with .
you hear how beautiful , how wonderful she is .
this restaurant has all the makings of a high class experience .
it has a pretty bar with house-infused liquor .
( i especially love the ginger vodka . )
however , that 's where the magical journy ends .
you enter the restaurant only to be told to wait .
`` well , '' says the snooty hostess , `` those are reserved . ''
you have half of your restaurant empty and those are all reserved ?
at the bar , we order two delicious drinks .
sure , i do n't mind that this one has food spilled on it .
the sangria here is awful .
i think it was a tequila sunrise .
the food is greasy and not in a good way .
but it is goat cheese .
how can you mess that up ?
the food is amazing and priced very well .
the bar is a blast and the staff is very friendly .
we usually sit at the bar and order up tapas and drinks .
the food is good and priced right .
the atmosphere is also wonderful , and very unique .
they also serve brunch , which is great !
i have some issues with this place .
it has really good potential but i definitely have mood swings about it .
the main restaurant is decent .
also , the wine selection is pretty decent .
but , i think the tapas side is just terrible .
it is supposed to be grilled .
not grilled then put in the fridge over the weekend !
i like radio maria .
the hummus is sooo good - and they serve it with toasted pita .
please please go here over boltini - much less pretentious .
good atmosphere but the food is overpriced and midiocre .
good service that is n't in your face .
highly recommend the pita chips and hummus .
i love the traditional dining at radio maria .
does it sometimes take longer than other restaurants ?
yes ... but that makes it more enjoyable and relaxing .
it is nice to sit outside and have a nice , paced dinner .
i 'm always pleased with the specials .
the service is attentive without being overbearing .
radio maria 's has a pretty extensive breakfast and lunch menu .
that is perfect omelet in my opinion .
spaces numbered _ num _ through _ num _ are reserved for this restaurant 's patrons .
at least it 's beautiful outside .
i remember when this place opened .
a facade that seems to be happy with the graduates of applebees .
my problem is i remember how much better it once was .
i miss the unique , creative , and delicious food in a friendly atmosphere .
i want to go back for more .
i mean , they serve absinthe !
i have always enjoyed myself here .
_ num _ ) their kitchen stays open all night .
nothing at this restaurant warrants the cost .
the staff always act like you 're wasting their time .
go to escobar if you want expensive food worth the cost .
this place takes small portions to a new level .
the only reason this place is getting two stars is because of their drinks .
if you want good cocktails that are overpriced this is your place !
the food is decent as well .
i feel like that summarizes this restaurant adequately .
go to radio maria and order their dinner specials .
falling fast .
pity to see an old favorite fall this far .
the architecture and style of the place is so artistic and unique .
it 's beautiful .
i love the artwork all over the walls and the bar area especially .
the drinks are reasonably priced and tasty too .
ho my god .
living on grad assistant paychecks , it 's a nice treat to come here .
take your date here .
their sunday brunch is outstanding !
they also have a bloody mary bar , which is incredible .
perhaps , more important is their tapas dinner menu and their selection of beer .
their beer and wine selection is top-notch !
radio maria is a tried and true champaign restaurant .
it 's a must if you 're in the area .
i always bring visitors and guests here !
it is definitely a more casual place .
it is pricier , but worth the money .
aghhhh this place is great !
you have to try their steak tips tapas dish .
hopefully it 's still there .
with the downtown champaign scene evolving , this kind of situation is unacceptable .
brunch menu is fantastic .
love the masa boat and the mexican cofee !
dinner is also good , but not amazing .
i have tried radio maria on visits to cu .
the food seems uninspired and the quality of ingredients is average .
i do like the decor of the bar .
i am giving this restaurant _ num _ stars .
i do n't want anyone else wasting their money at this establishment .
this has happened to other customers ?
you 're swell .
has a full resturant and a apas bar .
it 's definitely for `` friends '' after hours .
i remember i had the arancini ... .
the ambience at the bar is really exceptional .
the bartender can accomodate any request , with a passion .
we have him making key lime pie martinis , and they rock .
look at the bar - the rail is a retired escalator handrail .
even the host station is a re-purposed tube radio .
they are reserved to the hilt usually .
we have eaten here twice , and love the place .
the menu runs from an inventive tapas list to unique entrees .
love the bar , love the atmosphere .
next game , those kids are getting pizza or burgers !
the food is nothing to write home about .
i do n't plan on going back any time soon .
there are several other places downtown that are much better ( i.e .
highly recommend !
taste-wise nothing to write home about , the bread is just so-so .
nice ambient , but can get very noisy .
our overall rating of the restaurant is 2-star .
i mostly go here for brunch and the food rarely disappoints .
the torta maria and smoked port torta are unusual and always good .
the omelettes are only ok ; somehow they seem a bit dry and overcooked .
my main complaint with brunch is the coffee .
i believe the sauce mentioned in the description was absent .
i guess we were expected to order cocktails and appetizers .
i feel like radio ca n't decide what it is .
it does all those things fairly well , but none of them exceptionally .
strange lighting , and can get very loud later at night .
artsy and hip without being completely pretentious .
service can be a bit slow , but always friendly and knowledgeable .
beer list is always rotating .
i think the wheel has about _ num _ taps .
then a creative cocktail menu , which i have yet to try .
food is interesting .
hanger steak is good , as is the duck .
this is definitely a place to check out downtown .
what can i say ?
i understand that graduation weekend in chambana can be really crazy .
fill our water glasses ) , etc .
the restaurant is also extremely noisy .
there are restaurants in chambana that have great food for better prices .
the food is always amazing and the drinks are delicious .
brunch is especially delectable .
seems like the only spanish restaurant in c-u area ?
foods are good .
but the price is a little bit high since it locates at downtown champaign .
it does n't taste that good with the food .
it tastes better on its own .
it 's something you wo n't regret trying .
it 's sweet and has a strong cinnamon flavor .
i highly recommend going to radio maria for brunch !
great beer selection , nice outdoors sitting area .
* hearts-in-eyes emoji goes here * i absolutely love radio maria .
the atmosphere , decor , and food is downright enchanting .
if you want to wow your first date - do n't come here .
beer-bread toast is thick and incredible .
omelets are over-stuffed and innovative and completely satisfying .
regular specials make some variation on the menu .
coffee is aromatic and high quality .
biggest complaint of the night , and makes me not inclined to return .
by far our favorite spot we 've eaten at so far in champaign .
highly recommend - we 'll be back !
especially for date night , it 's a fantastic place .
the hummus is fantastic , as is the goat cheese with honey .
brunch is awesome delicious , loved the tapas and the paella .
prices seem high for the quantity and quality you get .
they have two menus , one for traditional dinner and one with tapas items .
lamb meatballs : tasty , especially with hidden gems of pine nuts .
if you really like meatballs , i definitely recommend these .
it 's always a safe bet for a great meal .
i always have tapas but they have a full dinner menu as well .
i recommend the hanger steak , plantains , and pork tacos .
the wine and beer selections are also substantially larger than the average restaurant .
can you please train the rest of the staff on how to be wonderful ?
we really enjoy this place .
service is great .
we usually sit at the bar so we see all the servers .
all are very nice and friendly .
things appear to move quickly and efficiently from the kitchen radio maria has the best cubans in champaign .
the tapas , however , are pretty good .
i love the old architecture and the period decorations .
when you walk in , the bar is is front of you .
their infused liquors are all made on premises .
the dining room is large .
they also have tables on the sidewalk which we took advantage of .
many veggie options first time here ... and i 've heard great things about this place .
and i have to say , it does live up to the hype .
definitely keep a lookout on the specials if you want something more memorable .
the food has always been top-notch .
i go there regularly for tapas and on the weekends for brunch .
the service and staff are all very friendly and accommodating .
the environment there is also quite enjoyable ; albeit a bit hispter-ish .
overall , i do n't think you 'll be disappointed here .
solid 4/5 they have an array of holiday drinks that were n't bad .
this is unbelievable .
this place is pretty awesome in downtown champaign .
that 's some good stuff to put on your fork !
in summer you can sit outside and it is something i will definitely repeat .
love their sides !
i love the cream cheese on the cinnamon cake !
especially love the cheese inside the omelette !
and the waitress is friendly !
this is our favorite brunch spot .
the flaming frida is delicious .
do n't waste your time on the bloody mary bar .
thats my main complaint , the bloody marys do n't have enough garnishes .
you 're lucky to get an olive .
i 've been here for both brunch and dinner .
it is likely the best brunch in champaign-urbana .
the french toast is a huge serving and delicious .
the omelettes are nice as well .
radio maria is good .
the menus are a bit unwieldy .
who puts feta on a cheese plate ?
this is our go-to date night dinner out .
i have never had a problem getting a gluten free meal here .
one complaint is that the menu is rarely updated .
highly recommend this place !
radio maria really is a bright spot in downtown champaign .
the dinner menu is small but far more evenly excellent .
their desserts are also wonderful .
and finally , go to radio maria for brunch .
radio maria is typically open at _ num _ on sunday 's .
therefore leaving a bunch of reservations at a complete loss .
they clearly need to get their management / organization in check .
learn more about what hospitality and professionalism is .
soooooo , i love radio maria .
i have loved it for years .
i have seriously been frequenting this place for over a decade .
sunday brunch is tradition for me and a handful of my girlfriends .
we literally do it in some form every weekend .
it 's always 5 pm on sunday funday ) .
in what restaurant world is this ok ?
do n't be petty .
the food seems extremely simple for their prices .
this is probably my go-to restaurant in champaign .
they have a diverse menu , and pretty much everything is very good . )
the place itself is very cool .
i like downtown champaign , and this is one of the nicer spaces .
the bar is truly outstanding .
the food always pleases .
it 's a very versatile place that can appeal to a variety of tastes .
nice looking place .
they have good hummus and i like the fried plantains .
otherwise , it 's fine .
brunch is the best time to go .
best unique and fancy restaurant i 've been to in downtown champaign .
you 're probably going to spend average $ 25 + per entree .
love the selection and proves are reasonable .
their paella is amazing .
i really need to try their tapas and meats .
there are so many good things to say about radio maria .
their style is a marriage between old world _ num _ 's and the 21st century .
the tables are decorated underneath and they are unique to every table .
there are about _ num _ tables outside if you like sitting outdoors .
they have a wide selection of omelets .
they also have egg dishes with rice and beans .
it includes vegetarian options .
try getting a slice of beer bread !
it 's hearty and is flavorful .
the churros are fluffy and not too sweet .
the service for a sunday brunch is slow .
the tapas menu is extensive .
hands down , my favorite dish to order are the lamb meatballs .
you have to try them !
i also love the paella .
it is big , so plan on sharing or gorging yourself in awesomeness .
their brunch menu has options that can appeal to everyone from vegetarians to children .
really great food and some great options if you 're a vegetarian .
this is our new fav spot when we come to town .
let me start this off by saying i 'm a very cheap eater .
first off , the restaurant has a great atmosphere .
well , it 's also great .
they have 1/2 off wine bottles !
this place is a local favorite and definitely somewhere to visit .
my first visit to radio maria and i love it .
you can choose to sit in a casual area or a dining room prices : pretty expensive for the amount of food you 're getting i feel blessed whenever i eat here .
the vibe is cool , and the food is great .
by the way , the beer bread is fantastic !
such a fun place to have tapas .
the paella is a must .
glad to know doug and steph are still there .
they make great drinks and are great for business .
food is good i like the changing menu .
get a reservation , though !
they also have great wine specials and the tapas is worth the price .
radio is definitely one of my favorite regular places .
the tapas are great , though generally quite small for what you pay .
the wine selection is excellent , too .
the tapas menu is really good ... and the ambience is really good .
first , it uses beef , which makes it a cottage pie .
again with the trying too hard ... .
i wish i had gotten more of those ... i 've also come for brunch , where they have various omelettes .
portions are great and very filling .
i 've been on the toilet since i got home and i feel great .
champaign has changed since i went to school here many moons ago .
it has changed for the much better .
i love the selection of restaurants and shops , and especially this place .
if you love spanish cuisine then give this place a try !
reservation does n't mean you are getting a seat !
does she not know what the word reservation mean ?
the point of making a reservation is getting a table at the reserved time !
i 'm from here , but have lived in la for _ num _ years .
radio maria is better than most la restaurants !
check it out !
i 've eaten here on average of around eight times a year since _ num _ .
i 've always had really good servers and bartenders here .
some of the menu dishes are downright bad by any standard .
a vanilla cream sauce does n't complement goat cheese , for example .
it is n't interesting .
it 's just kind of awful .
crystal is the worse !
the restaurant itself is small place , with a bad lighting .
the owner usually has an attitude towards the customers !
it is usually pretty empty , lunch or dinner time .
so , i have no clue how this place survives .
this is my new favorite restaurant in chambana !
the falafal is very fresh and moist .
the yogurt salad is homemade and the perfect side for any of their sandwiches .
also , the samosas are lightly fried and delicately delicious .
this place is also incredibly cheap .
the actual physical space is modestly decorated with middle eastern art and photos .
it 's sort of subtly charming .
i know middle eastern food well , and have eaten falafel in many cities .
the falafel sandwich is one of the best i 've ever had .
is delicious , and the lamb kebab sandwich is also fantastic .
the prices are amazing .
it 's a must try .
below , i 've documented some of my observations while eating there .
read on : ( we learned later that you can just request a specific meat . )
* this is the second example involving weird numbers .
great food , great place to get together with friends , great prices !
do n't be intimidated by the owner ... give the place a shot ... you wo n't regret it !
i personally love the falafal !
highlights : - fairly cheap - probably not as bad as you think the quality of the food is inconsistent .
the guy who works there seems very stressed and angry .
he does n't ever smile .
the prices are good and when the food is good , it is decent .
of all restaurants in chambana , this is by far my favorite .
the food is homemade-like , which was always a big plus for me .
it is a big tray with an assortment of tasty items .
i can more simply define jerusalem as : tasty , tasty , tasty .
totally love it .
some people complain about him .
the arabian tea is also delish !
the food is quite good and reasonable .
i love giving him the business and i love the taste of his food !
i give it _ num _ stars because service can be hit or miss .
rest of food being mediocre .
the hummus is to die for .
we usually get the dish of the day .
my personal favorite is the fish .
it 's cheap , but definitely not cheaply prepared !
the spiced tea ( hot or cold ) is delicious , too .
vegetarian plate is great , cheap and healthy inexpensive , solid falafel and fries .
my favorite place to eat in urbana-champaign .
( - ) sometimes slow ; the best deal is probably the plate of the day .
when i come alone , i usually get something smaller .
_ num _ rice and veggies ( small for $ _ num _ ) _ num _ lentil soup ( small for $ _ num _ ) dolmeh ( stuffed grape leaves ) is great too , but rather expensive .
but wait time is too long !
: ( restaurant review do you remember that episode in seinfeld at the soup restaurant .
not the best customer service , but i digress .
the upside is the food is inexpensive compared to chicago .
there are daily specials .
i just wish the lamb was not cooked way through .
pro : inexpensive , authentic middle eastern food i 'm surprised by some of the positive reviews this place has received .
just not worth going !
i always get the steak shawarma !
this is my favorite place in c-u for a quick , cheap lunch .
the guy at the counter is pretty stony-faced , but he 's always polite .
i wonder if there 's some kind of secret pattern to them ... not sure i 'd evem give them _ num _ star .
menu on yelp states lentil soup is made with olive oil .
i 'm not sure .
he does n't talk or even smile .
i 'm never coming back to this place .
love the tea here .
iced tea is just as good .
the food is simple , a little plain but good .
lentil soup is also tasty and filling .
the falafel does leave something to be desired .
i also do n't mind the guy behind the counter .
this guy smiles at you its genuine .
this restaurant serves very healthy food .
love the plate of the day .
alright , the owner really tries .
the tea here is excellent and the falafel has improved greatly .
food is very fresh here !
i am a big fan of jerusalem these days .
i can see the one and only guy cooking , taking orders and cleaning .
it 's up to you , folks !
... whatever makes you happy .
going to come here more often , and the prices are great too .
chicken is cooked to a perfection !
daily specials get you full with less than $ _ num _ .
it shows in the restaurant , which is well decorated and spotlessly clean .
you decide whether that 's a good price .
its a standard shawarma and theres nothing to complain about .
veggies are fresh ; meat could use a bit more flavor , is all .
so it depends on what you 're feeling .
the fish is excellent with the lunch special .
red roof fit the bill nicely .
i love a hotel where the cashier sits behind bulletproof glass .
nothing makes me feel safer .
`` do all the non-smoking rooms have ash trays in them ? ''
first and last time i stay at a red roof .
are .
have stayed at other red roofs ; nothing like this one .
pass this up and spend more money elsewhere .
the staff feeds the squirrels and they 're friendly .
construction is going on and lots of storage containers in the parking lots . )
do n't even bother .
the rate may be cheap but it 's still too much .
_ num _ stars for being gross .
+ _ num _ star for being near a taco bell and tgifridays the hotel is not bad at all .
kids _ num _ and under stay free , pets also .
by i74 and near several places to eat .
this is applicable for all red roof inns .
pros : - tv has hdmi can connect to ipad , chromecast , etc .
i like to walk barefoot so i could tell that the floor was clean .
the place is pet friendly which is another plus for a lot of people .
front desk staff is friendly but otherwise this place is a complete bust .
this hits the hotel trifecta : cheap , spacious and clean .
but it is , as advertised , very comfortable .
stay away .
sleep in the park ; it 's cleaner .
my kids call it `` low-quality inn '' .
is that enough comments ?
the staff and management is even worse .
the people that run this hotel are incredibly unprofessional .
do not stay here !
and do n't forget rude staff , that was the cherry on top !
we are writing a travel book .
he comes back and gives it a clean bill of health .
i go down , and yes , it 's better looking .
until i look in the bathroom .
there 's no toilet seat !
it 's broken off and thrown under the sink .
`` listen , i 'm usually not a complainer ... '' more apologies .
off he goes to check another room .
he comes back .
this room is fine , he says .
it 's clean , has a toilet seat .
i go down to the room , and it passes my quick inspection .
twenty minutes later , i realize the room is no warmer .
i check the heating unit and it 's blowing cold air .
that 's it , i 'm done !
this place is a hell hole .
do n't stay here !
one star only because zero stars is not an option .
jack lawson this hotel is dirty and smells bad .
management is friendly but everything needs cleaned .
pay a few more dollars and stay somewhere else .
do n't use this company .
a lot of chemicals in one pile results in dead grass .
never ever use this company .
totally agree with the previous review .
simply , they try to charge for applications they never have done .
worse , communication with this company is a nightmare .
i think that there is something wrong with the company ( seriously ) .
someone at the company is making the application record up or cooking the book .
these people seem to be off their meds !
save your money .
these people are a joke !
so easy to work with their friendly and professional staff !
apparently the management does not think highly of the state 's smoking ban .
i guess they took care of that problem .
what 's the point ? )
great customer service no , this is not health food . )
the grill is also used for garlic butter texas toast as well as potato-grilling .
the point of going to alexanders is to cook your own food .
if you just want a steak then go somewhere else .
that said , the experience that they create at this restaurant is wonderful .
wear comfortable shoes if you plan to cook .
this is the place to go for your steak fix on a student budget .
i mean , seriously ?
i have to cook it ?
i guess .
great concept - pick your own , cook your own steak .
steaks are huge ... ... wait , restaurant ... cook my own food ?
the prices are absolutely ridiculous .
not a good sign for the quality of food to say the least .
my family goes here for special occasions .
i love the food .
you get to pick out your own steak which is pretty cool .
service has always been pretty good .
that being said , their steak is well above average and fairly priced .
the service is always very friendly and they make themselves available .
by far my favorite steakhouse in the champaign-urbana area and recommend it to all .
excellent service , excellent food , love the socializing at the grill .
the salad bar is good but not great .
overall , this place is good .
there are so many varieties of meat to choose from .
for starters , the steak 's quality here is just okay .
it 's not the greatest , but i 've had worse .
their steak challenge is pretty interesting though .
the rewards of this challenge has changed from time to time ( i.e .
i 've tried this before .
overall , alexander 's is a good break from the national chain steak restaurants .
this has got to be one of the most overrated eateries in the area .
decent decor and texas toast is good .
take a grillmaster with you .
and a good trip it is .
the beef is aged and of good quality .
there are also chicken and seafood meals .
its sad there are n't many places like this anymore .
its great that there is alexander 's .
they charge you extra for their chef to cook it .
the place is outdated and dirty .
i can make a better steak at home for half the price .
i guess i am not in a huge hurry to go back .
i dont plan on ever returning there again these people giving bad reviews are missing the point .
this restaurant has been here for 30 + years .
the whole concept behind it is cooking your own steak !
do n't listen to the haters .
this place has a patina to it .
enjoy it in this world of chain restaurants .
eddie has been there longer than some customers are old .
if you like an old school steakhouse , this is a must .
this is on my top _ num _ for casual dining .
do n't plan on visiting again .
wait for _ num _ minutes .
she never show up .
okay chef bring steak back to me .
and never see my sever again .
and all the time happen the manager stand _ num _ feet away from us .
ask me steak good or not .
my t born steak have not any favor at all .
think about .
and pay extra for them to cook .
but this is night mare for me i give _ num _ star cuz chef bring steak back to me .
i mean , vinyl tablecloths at a steakhouse ?
so this is basically my husbands favorite place in champaign .
we have been there _ num _ times now and it 's always good .
all the meat is great !
it 's a mans restaurant for sure !
there is a great salad bar too .
i really love how clean it is here !
never once have i had a complaint .
they seem to have it together .
i do n't like how closed in it is around the grills .
you can hardly move .
let alone drink your expensive wine ... my server has always been nice and helpful .
but do n't go here and plan to eat quick .
this place takes time .
anyways ... its meat you want ... that 's what you 'll get here !
you have to pay $ _ num _ for them to cook your steak .
get a long island ice tea .
they are amazing .
highly recommend .
eating at the bar , the staff is friendly .
the salad bar is so so needs to be cleaned now and then .
we were hoping for better , do n't think i will be back this is a really nice experience .
you get to cook your own food .
the place is amazing .
this place is always amazing .
i do not care what other people think .
if not then i have eddie prepare it for me .
this is a hangout spot , made to have a good time .
this place needs some money put into it but the owners refuse i guess .
its not like they dont make money with what they charge .
in my mind a reservation at _ num _ means you get seated around _ num _ .
that is totally fair and understandable .
way too expensive for what you get .
how many businesses steer people to less expensive when they can ?
no pressure to commit .
the carpet is so comfortable to sit on the floor .
carpet is too expensive compared to other places .
store review : this is like a combination of marshall 's with kohls .
love the store !
they have some fun home decor too .
yah , i know .
it 's just a gas station/convenience store .
not something to yelp about .
except that it is .
they do .
road trips mean public bathrooms , which few folks think of as enjoyable .
but this is what made me have to yelp it .
oh and they have cold bottles of water .
the road ranger is literally two minutes off i-57 .
ladies room is clean and functional , but not posh .
but it is free .
some things have to happen , that 's just the way the universe works .
it 's monday night at _ num _ am , and you are hungry .
so you stop here .
it 's normally really dirty in there too .
so , i go back in to get one .
i select a lovely orange one .
her : can i see your id ?
me : you need to see my id ?
other girl behind the counter : she 's never checked you out before .
me : oh , she 's `` checked me out '' before .
the wait in the long line at the stand is worth it .
they have the best tasting custard around !
you can create your own mixture with their large variety of toppings !
it kind of reminds you of a dairy queen but sooo much better !
the place to go for ice cream/custard/sundaes .
yum i love jarlings !
all the flavors and toppings are delicious .
example of how good this place is ... my dad does n't eat ice cream very often .
my parents rarely ever have it in the freezer .
he 's actually a bit lactose intolerant .
jarling 's is quite the summer afternoon and evening delight .
custard cup is exactly one of those places .
i highly recommend the vanilla cold fudge sundae ... yum .
this place is a landmark in cu .
i only wish it were closer to campus .
i highly recommend the lemon custard .
next birthday do n't bake - try a jarling 's illini pie .
i have n't found anything anywhere to beat that !
i 'm definitely dropping by here after i get off the plane .
lines can be long , but service is pretty good .
it 's good , but getting more expensive every year .
too bad it 's _ num _ miles away .
luckily my parents still live there !
goddamn i miss this place .
cold stone creamery has got nothing on custard cup .
i really like that you can add banana to anything too !
they love it and its pretty cheap .
custard than actually eating it !
it 's a shame this place closes for the winter .
good god do i miss this place .
it is delicious .
there are chemicals in it , that make you crave it fortnightly .
i think this place is a little overrated .
i love this place .
it 's a staple from college and worth a trip here everytime .
snowstorm , maybe ) : _ num _ custard or ice cream or frozen yogurt or whatever you want to call it _ num _ peanut butter cups where in this list do you see peanuts ?
try telling that to jarling 's .
actually , i guess that is what i 'm saying .
i only wish that places like this existed in evanston !
it 's good .
but there 's so much hype about it that i expected more .
i love jarlings !
every time i come and visit champaign , i have a craving for jarlings .
their ice cream and custard is the epitome of comfort .
their peach shakes is one of my favorites .
but do n't forget , they accept cash and personal check only .
you are a delicious custardy fiesta .
i like custard .
jarlings sells custard .
therefore , i like jarlings .
i 'm not sure what they are doing with the industrial-sized kitchen area .
then the workers scoop the custard out of the bin .
that 's cool .
: d the fruit flavors are still my favorite too .
it 's everything he said it would be and more .
i like the vanilla custard with butterscotch , or the orange custard by itself .
i mean , of course its good , its cold , creamy and sweet .
but so is the ice cream from anywhere else .
the stuff is just great .
the only flavor that seems to be good here is the chocolate .
otherwise , save your money and your time and just go somewhere else .
it 's pretty good stuff , although a little pricey .
i 'm a fan of the cold fudge and tortoise sundaes .
this place is true americana !
the custard is delicious and there are quite a few varieties to choose from . )
stop by and savor this treat !
custard cup is another of my defining childhood spots .
i 've grown up with custard cup , and i love it .
do n't be scared of lemon , it 's it 's heavenly .
the only custard i am familiar with is flan , but what 's this ?
it comes in ice cream form too ?
especially considering the price .
trust me i am an expert on frozen desserts .
also , they have green river slushees which i 've never found anywhere else !
- heeaavvennlly custard - reasonable prices/sizes - great parking and outdoor seating - awesome service everyone in champaign knows custard cup .
i usually just stick with the snowstorms and i have never been disappointed .
: o ( the service here is great too .
all the people who work there are awesome , fast and efficient .
haha they also have a crapload of parking , which is awesome .
and outdoor seating with umbrellas !
this is a local tradition and curiosity .
there are only a few kinds of custard .
the lemon and the orange are exceptional .
this is the only five star food review i have posted for champaign-urbana .
i 've never had frozen custard until i lived in champaign .
let me just say that this stuff is amazing !
custard is n't really like anything i 've tried before .
it 's rich and creamy .
and the prices are extremely reasonable .
i 'm not kidding .
things i love : - strawberry shortcake snowstorm - pumpkin pie snowstorm ( seasonal .
- strawberry custard - any float there 's nothing that hits the spot as well as jarlings .
seriously , jarlings is that good .
to those drawing similarities between their product and ice cream ?
you 're gastronomically challenged .
yes they are both cold and dairy based , but it ends there .
their custard is obviously so much denser and creamier than ice cream .
ice cream by process has to have a bunch of air stirred into it .
jarlings inc world wide could have an ipo greater than google 's ; ) boy do i loooooove custard cup !
i 'm not a big ice cream person , but this stuff is awesome !
mmmm i want some jarlings right now !
it 's way better than cold stone , marble slab & dq combined !
pretty rockin ' !
: o ) you 're too late .
: o ( n : ever too cold to eat frozen custard .
why are you open seasonally ?
i miss it !
the only downside is cash-only .
i am so happy when this place is open !
but for this treat i do n't mind stopping at the atm beforehand .
now stay open all year long !
this is place is just awesome .
definitely going to come back again in my future trips .
pros : tastes like ice cream cons : custard melts too quickly , slow service , incompetent staff it did not live up to all the fuss .
bring friends .
there 's really nothing like sharing an experience like this with friends .
the atmosphere here is friendly and welcoming .
the custard also invites you to eat it .
i know i 'm about to commit champaign-urbana blasphemy , but ... i do n't get the hype .
yeah , i know boring , right ?
this is a must-try of champaign best place ever .
one of the few things i miss about champaign ... haha .
apparently this is tom hank 's favorite place , how do i know that ?
i have nothing against this custard place .
its old school , and an institution i 'm sure .
however , in my humble fat opinion , custard sucks .
it is just not that good of a dairy dessert .
say it ai n't so - what 's next , curtis orchard ?
other than that , i love custard cup .
i never feel like it 's officially summer until this place is open !
loves .
snicker parfait is a winner , as is the praline snowstorm .
pretty much hard to go wrong with anything on the menu here !
: - ) chambananites , thank you for introducing me to this place .
mainly i recall my past experience of rock-solid curd that everyone calls custard .
it is that good !
long lines , throngs of teenagers , closes relatively early - sure .
but the custard is sooo worth the wait !
just do n't forget to bring cash ( or a check ) .
just do it .
urgent update : they now have gummy bears .
thank you , jarling 's .
i love this place .
it 's not the best , but it ' s definitely not the worst .
jarling 's cares nothing for trends , for fashion , for progress .
it 's jarling 's .
it 's beyond cool .
it 's eternal .
they can make about anything .
not too much to really say , it 's just good .
it 's got great ice cream and other frozen treats .
some of the best i 've had and the prices are reasonable too .
hmmm , not bad but i have had creamier custard .
cash only , kids , or take your old-fashioned checkbook .
i always get sad and anxious when jarling 's closes in november .
my usual order is the grasshopper snowstorm .
the smallest portion is still too big .
i wish they had an even smaller size !
their ice cream is really smooth and soft and tasty .
it is kind of semi-expensive nowadays though .
i usually keep it simple with a chocolate chip cookie dough snowstorm .
the smallest size makes me full .
their ice cream/custard is seriously like the best i 've ever had ever .
i can vouch this for their vanilla and lemon custards .
i hate carrying cash .
i get the same thing every time because it is so darn good !
that 's all i want .
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it .
whenever i come home , i have to get some custard cup .
sometimes there are lines that go out the door .
but be patient ... it 's so worth it .
and it 's just a sign that this stuff is good , right ?
they now have a drive-thru which is really cool .
you can also buy the frozen custard in bulk .
now that i have self-control that is .
so something to think about .
excellent custard , good shakes , good blizzards , etc .
lemon custard with cold fudge is a favorite !
i am not a big ice cream or frozen custard fan .
what is cold fudge ?
how is it different from all the other 's ?
all i can say is , i am officially hooked .
apparently this is the place to go for custard , and i agree !
they also offer a weekly specialty flavor .
i also suggest getting a pint or quart to go .
it 's much cheaper than eating an order there .
seasonal place that is always a favorite .
get the cold fudge sundae .
but obviously the ice cream is good .
i rate frozen custard places on one criterion : chocolate chips .
jarling 's does that right , and earns my champaign loyalty .
so glad that summer is back ... .
the banana chocolate chip snowstorm and the oatmeal cookie snowstorm are amazing !
custard cup never seems to let down .
either way , custard cup is still the greatest .
what 's not to like ?
get the small size and let your taste buds go to heaven .
this is the place to get frozen custard .
i love the cold fudge sundae !
jarlings holds a special place in our hearts .
it 's the best ice cream place in town .
they also do n't have hot fudge and get fussy if you ask .
luckily the custard is good enough that it eclipses any grievances .
when we move away someday , i know i will miss this custard sorely .
their custards are to die for !
they offer a different ` flavor of the week ' every week .
i love love love jarling 's !
my grams always gets their cold fudge and that 's super yummy as well .
a champaign institution and not to be missed !
i love jarling 's custard .
every time i try something new , i 'm never disappointed .
everything here tastes divine , so do n't be afraid to experiment !
also , junior cups are huge , so order in moderation .
the tortoise is supposed to feature cold fudge , almonds , and butterscotch .
there are multiple benches inside , as well as a drivethru .
i always try to try something new .
service is a little slow but snowstorms are definitely made with love .
everyone i 've talked to has been personable and friendly .
and now i 'm craving custard , great .
i remember visiting my uncle and going to jarlings custard cup as a child .
there 's also a drive thru for those on the go .
the custard single dip is plentiful on a waffle cone .
this place has so many flavors , it puts dq to shame .
the pies and ice cream sandwiches are great too .
cold fudge shake = heaven .
i think it 's my favorite cold dessert of all time .
only give it 4/5 stars because their service is slow .
and i 'm a slow coffee-drinker .
the cold fudge sundae with vanilla custard is my favorite thing on the menu .
the pumpkin pie snowstorm ( seasonal ) takes a close second .
it 's so delicious !
it 's great for the summer days definitely .
excellent frozen treats for hot summer nights .
the menu is more than just custard .
rootbeer floats and other combinations ) .
i personally think that this place is a little bit overrated .
my personal favorite is their vanilla sundae with crushed peanuts .
no doubt you are getting a fun experience when you come here .
so be prepared with cash unless you are buying for you group/family !
that being said , this place is awesome and very fairly priced .
get out there , check it and yelp it !
it 's a frosty treat that 's like ice cream but ... creamier ?
i dig this place !
the price for that is a bit hefty .
otherwise just go to coldstone and get freaking ice cream .
i also love how its a central hubbub for townies during warm summer nights .
it 's definitely a place to visit , but maybe just once .
this is such a local gem .
everyone from the _ num _ knows this place as a symbol of their childhood .
the crazy lines are part of the experience .
use it as an opportunity to observe the townies , we 're interesting people .
cold fudge is their specialty , and yeah , it really is better cold .
who does n't love lemon custard ?
the only negative is the long lines - but still worth it !
they now accept cards as payment , and their service is always solid .
restaurant review frozen custard , just what you need on a hot summer day .
the ice cream `` custard '' is super smooth .
you can eat right outside the benches or drive through .
all and all this place is simply amazing !
the mediums are a good size ( i wan na say _ num _ oz .
is the heatwave burning up your body ?
a _ num _ oz junior size cup is all you need , guaranteed .
the service is so slow it 's ridiculous .
it can take 20-30 minutes for a cup .
it 's an okay product but the service is unbearable .
jarlings custard cup .
quite the urbana champaign institution it is .
first , the vanilla custard and cold fudge are great .
i love their snow storm .
sitting outside with it .
life is so good .
only it is a pity that it closes at winter : ( one of my favorite desert palces in town .
they have the best custard with soo many toppings to choose from .
: ) a nice place to hangout and get something sweet on a warm day .
a big selection and the custard is creamy and delicious .
the same person who takes the order , makes the order .
hire _ num _ more people .
one person , takes orders and money , another makes the order .
pick the shortest of three lines .
plus it moves fast .
no other words to describe it .
i use to come here frequently .
unfortunately , the new owners/management have not figured how to run the place .
it takes way to long to get through the line .
i hope this improves !
i visit this place everytime i come to champaign .
be sure to bring cash !
this place is a nice little gem in champaign .
i suggest the vanilla custard with cold fudge .
it is absolutely delicious .
there are plenty of seats outside , and there is a large parking lot .
i usually get the lemon custard .
i have been coming here since the _ num _ 's .
i probably have hundreds of visits here .
no trip to cu is complete without a stop here .
i 've had sundaes , but love the snowstorm .
the fruit ones are my favorite .
the lines are long .
there are three lines , one for each window .
they move slowly since everything is hand dipped .
marriages have been contracted in these lines .
ltrs have broken up in these lines .
they have abundant outdoor seating and a drive-thru .
check it out -- classic and good .
always delivers .
tons of flavor combinations with their snowstorms ( mix in shakes or blizzards ) .
the other treats ordered by earlier guests looked quite a bit more generous .
i pretty much go here constantly when they 're open for the season .
it makes winter all the worse with no custard cup .
snowstorms are an obvious go to here .
just go and keep going .
there 's so much menu to explore and it 's all incredible .
i adore jarling 's .
it is the embodiment of an old time ice cream shoppe .
i have gone here ever since i was a little kid .
thank goodness for the new owners !
do not let the sizes deceive you ; the smalls are pretty large !
the strawberry flavor is subtle .
for some reason it gives a different feeling than hot fudge .
some people may say that it is pricey for what you order .
this is not how it works !
there are _ num _ windows and _ num _ different lines .
in my experience , the window on the very left is the shortest !
oh the custard is oh so good !
i can not complain about this place as everyone seems to love it .
jarling 's is the best place to get ice cream in the c-u area .
i have been going to this place every summer for years !
it is unlike anything i 've had before .
i highly recommend trying this one !
they lock the doors at exactly _ num _ pm .
it 's hard to get frozen custard wrong .
definitely worth the price - and wait .
this is very good frozen custard and the toppings are great as well .
it 's frozen custard , not yogurt or ice cream .
i 'm probably not a fan of custard .
there 's also outdoor seating !
look no further .
grasshopper with cold fudge = best damn thing i 've ever had everything i 've tried from here hit 's the spot .
i wish they 'd stay open year round .
okay , so i may be reprimanded for this rating !
i do n't get how this is good ` custard ' .
if custard stands for froyo-ish ice cream then yes it 's good .
and the lemon one is the best flavour .
but , imho , this is not custard .
i love this place ... .
it is five stars .
their cold fudge is the best .
it 's still summer !
jarling 's is a local ice cream gem !
so why is this a _ num _ star review and not a _ num _ star review ?
the only downside is that it is pretty small and can get really crowded .
try the coconut , lemon custard the `` custard '' at this place is good but definitely not the best .
the reason for the long wait is that they are super inefficient .
it 's good , but definitely nothing out of this world .
it 's just that this is the only custard place in town .
they have benches for seating outside .
this place is only open during the summer .
i am used to waiting there so that was n't a problem .
still tastes delicious as always and i still have n't tried the cold fudge .
i always go with _ num _ dips in a cone .
; ) jarling 's is definitely one of the major highlights of summer time in cu .
anyways , it 's better late than never .
i love their snowstorms , and sundaes .
they taste fresh , creamy and yum .
what can i say , i 'm optimistic .
gon na try as many flavors as i can till summer lasts .
long wait for ok ice cream .
jarling 's custard cup is a champaign institution .
my husband usually gets regular custard ( any flavor ) in a cone .
our family members have gotten a variety of different snowstorms and are never disappointed .
check it out !
if i had to imagine the most depressing place it is here .
the soda machine dispenses the tears of clowns along with pepsi .
restaurant review you have these a different standard when evaluating this .
answering questions like `` what do you have like miller lite ? ''
( the answer is , the water cooler is right over there ) .
try try , or have try ?
try try .
i can finally take a quick smoke break .
so you put out the smoke .
you are down to one .
you finally get everyone out just after closing time .
two packs , you reply .
she still does n't laugh .
this is not a gas station !
this is the twilight zone !
the service dept is excellent ... too bad my car was not .
i have received poor service from this kfc location many times .
ranging from no napkins at the drive-thru ( a big pet peeve of mine !
( i know ... gross ! )
ridiculous they are that slow .
i hate chain restaurants .
every time i 've been here , i 've been unsatisfied .
the employees have all been some serious twats also .
i do n't believe any positive reviews came from actual customers .
actually my real rating is _ num _ ... !
do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else .
one star for having a drive through .
however , when said drive through is slow and inaccurate it renders itself useless .
you like it one day and hate it thenext .
terrible terrible employees , worst customer service i 've received in a while .
i 'm shocked at how confrontational this employee was .
i 'm watching this kid make my sandwich with the pace of a snail .
he 's waiting for the toaster to beep for the person behind me .
meanwhile my sandwich is just sitting there on the counter .
the girl is just standing there .
doing nothing to help .
i cant say enough good things about the customer service i have received here .
ty especially has been a real pleasure to work with .
highly recommend !
angela , the store manager is a super star !
thank you again , angela !
i 'm the customer standing here ready to make a purchase .
price is fair .
sauce is so , so much better than their old stuff .
crust is like having an order of buttery-garlic soft bread sticks with your pizza .
i can tell that it is hand-made fresh .
now , 1st off - i live at summitt ( by bob ) .
wikipedia that ish ladies and gent 's ; kansas city bullriders ) .
who really knows these things .
never has crushed peppers !
but the pizza ai n't too shabby .
low rating is for price vs. quality , and value .
not coming back .
i have always ordered pizza from dominos and the delivery have been so so .
never have i ever gotten delivery that was super hot .
thank you .
the manager jason is very rude and does n't take ownership for his mistakes .
screwed up our orders 2/3 times we 've ordered there .
but service is lacking big time .
no complaints use the online tracker not as much salt and grease et al .
keep up the good work i would give them a zero if i could .
hope they enjoy the pizza and chicken they made and never delivered .
what a way to make it right , wrong !
i 'm disgusted .
i have never experienced such a lack of concern for providing customer good service .
the disregard shown today is a health code violation in the making .
i use the online ordering system , and it is simple .
the delivery drivers are always friendly , and smiling .
this location is definitely my go to pizza place .
`` viad tower restaurants '' what a great find .
this is a nice upscale cafeteria style restaurant .
everything is homemade from carved sandwiches to pizza and daily specials .
the prices are very reasonable .
i will be back next time i 'm in the neighborhood !
okay , for cafeteria food the viad cafeteria really is n't that bad .
the sitting area is clean and nice .
only eat here if you are stuck in this building and pressed for time .
it 's a cafeteria , do not expect `` nobou '' .
for what it is , it 's very nice .
i always expect a cafeteria/lunch place to be kind of blah .
sonja is great !
i refer clients to sonja .
while some were beyond help , she has helped others who thought they were .
do not add insult ( or anguish ) to injury .
insurance companies represent your interest after theirs , if at all .
attorneys settle .
representing themselves , then the insurance companies , then you .
not sonja - she puts you 1st !
think you do n't need an attorney ?
call her .
i am a worker 's comp and ss attorney here in phoenix .
she is very responsive and caring to her clients .
i highly recommend her .
sonja duckstein is the epitome of a client first mentality .
sonja and her paralegal marcy are great .
this parking garage is below the palomar , golds gym , breakfast club .
i 'm not sure of the rates .
i dislike parking garages .
they are not the most secure place to park .
i mean is n't that part of what staffing consultants do ?
administering evaluations , placing candidates and contacting other branches about current candidates ?
parking is relatively easy to find and the offices are clean and inviting .
rude and have no clue when working with mortgage proccessors .
post jobs that are n't available .
say they submitted and its a immediate hire position .
veronica has worse personality of all !
they compete with each other and do not care about you !
high school games stick with better known staffing firms like adecco , randstant etc veronica is probably the only person who knows whats going on at this place .
ooooohhhh haaahaaa wow no nope never again from what i remember ( and was told !
do n't waste your night there !
$ _ num _ cover , no hats , and they steal your id .
how is this garbage still in business ?
the point of this whole review is this : ladies , watch out for this sleazeball bartender .
this place is a joke .
call me crazy but is n't there anywhere in phoenix to dance .
god forbid you go to sky lounge on a saturday night .
sorry sky lounge , you suck .
lol dont use your credit/debit card !
do n't know why lots of people dislike this place for .
i think it 's pretty cool .
overall the place is okay with me .
gets pretty packed on the weekends .
this place is awesome !
i usually get the vip on the second floor .
if that is a thing .
that 's what sky lounge is .
vip service needs improvements got two beers .
do n't get beer here .
_ num _ star is more than this place deserves .
today is monday and i am still sick .
we think it was the ranch dressing that came with the meal .
thanks for ruining our vacation !
the first floor is 18 + and it was hip hop/latin .
the second level is 21 + and it was hip hop/latin .
when it comes to music and atmosphere , it 's great .
that 's got to be the most annoying shit ever !
this place is always turnt !
i always like coming thru with my friends on friday and saturday night .
definitely gon na bring my fraternity bros here !
the cover is $ _ num _ .
ask if you get lost and the security or bartenders will point you there .
i like the size of the floor , which is tile .
also note there is a strict dress code - it is posted outside .
they do have metal detectors going in .
however , i have rarely seen any fights and i feel safe here .
www.clubdwntwn.com think `` the matrix '' meets `` blade . ''
solution for the yelper : if you can , drink before you go .
seating : maybe , just maybe , invest in another velvetine sectional or two .
club pallazzo certainly charges enough for cover to afford a new couch .
the ambiance : the inside is gorgeous .
the dj i like also dj 's at le homme on wed. nights .
but overall the music is good .
i know some people that go every weekend .
the drinks were a bit pricey though , so bring a flask .
this is definetly a goth club .
if its not your speed , there are two other clubs literally next door .
omg , i 'm sooooo sad .
i 'm such an individual i need to look like everyone else ... .
the decor is beautiful , good amount of seating .
it 's a one room club with ample space .
but if more people start going it would probably get _ num _ stars !
these guys deserve better than that .
phoenix , arizona has always stood by snakes !
just to clarify-not reviewing that particular dance night , just the establishment itself .
every time i have been , the bar has been understaffed .
two for an entire nightclub that is packed ?
how does that work ?
there 's also a back bar that seems to never be in use .
it 's almost as if this is a bare bones establishment .
place is awesome , bartenders real nice .
we need a better scene and better dj 's !
they charge a cover which is $ _ num _ not bad .
the drinks are a bit expensive .
they have three dance floors .
we are fortune we are working with him .
we recommend him to anyone who has a need for a compassionate attorney .
rick freeman i highly recommend him .
amy bertorelli former president of kings ransom hotel and kings ransom inn what can i say .
they are honest mechanics i know it is a rarity !
i have had my car served numerous times from them .
i guess i should have seen this coming ?
i have never been charged to look at the car .
not a great way to build a relationship .
but be prepared to pay for it .
being honest about the diagnosis of a car is only half the battle .
being honest about pricing is just as important .
hours it takes to swap them out ?
keep up the great work .
that 's effing class , folks .
that being said this is why i give my _ num _ stars to virginia auto .
being a single women is always a bit unverving taking my car in repairs .
these guys are amazing !
i realize my car needs some tlc .
i love the fact they told me everything that was wrong with my car .
( just joking but it was n't far off ) the owner matt allen is a champion .
i am not a happy customer - i 'm a fan .
i highly recommend this shop .
keep up the good work !
always glad to support local businesses !
: ) yes , virginia auto does good work .
yes , they offer great customer service .
no , it 's not worth paying double for .
do yourself a favor and check out inman & sons instead .
i fully recommend i thought i had a problem with my car 's heater .
i love these guys , they are smart , friendly and fair !
i 've been taking my car here since moving to phoenix a year ago .
three things really stand out about this shop : _ num _ .
everyone is professional and very nice .
that 's not a given at every auto shop .
it is so hard to trust in these type of businesses especially when you feel you are being taken advantage of .
since finding this shop , i hope they never ever close their business doors , because i am a forever customer .
i will drive whatever distance i have to drive to get my vehicle here in their most capable hands .
their customer service is unsurpassed .
they provide transportation to and from your work or home .
their workmanship is excellent .
they may not you will `` you get what you pay for '' .
they 're not the cheapest in town but they do high quality work .
they are clean , friendly , and helpful .
well , i have a little _ num _ ford taurus .
and now , my little car has a great shop looking after her .
now that is service !
the team here at virginia auto service is the best .
have been taking my vehicles here for a few years since we moved downtown .
in the end , you do end up getting what you pay for .
mr. pascal adcock exemplifies the image that is virginia auto service .
their reputation definitely precedes themselves and pascal lives up to that image .
i highly recommend them to anybody who has a vehicle .
these guys are dependably polite and make you feel at ease .
these guys do a great job .
accommodating with drop off to work with burgie .
i know a little something about cars .
my uncle has been a mechanic for over _ num _ years .
i hope no one gets hurt because of virginia auto service beware .
he has only sent vague and threatening emails .
i understand that all shops have different prices , but i am disappointed .
they also warranty their work , i believe it 's _ num _ years/24 ,000 miles ?
i 'm just not happy with the idle once the engine is at temp .
you can purchase the ford fuel pump for $ _ num _ from rockauto.com !
i 'm not sure how much these guys know about anything .
their shop rate is $ _ num _ .
seriously , does anyone do honest work anymore ?
to : matt a. , ( business owner ) i may not know everything , but i have honor and integrity .
yelps review process is totally rigged ... what a joke !
they only claim to be impartial .
i 'm just not happy with the idle once the engine is at temp .

seriously , does anyone do honest work anymore ?
to : matt a. , ( business owner ) i may not know everything , but i have honor and integrity .
amazing service and trustworthy , coming from someone who just moved to the valley .
i do not think they are honest and i definitely do not recommend them !
who does that ?
that is crazy !
i 've never experienced such excellent service from start to finish .
the wild thaiger is one of my new favorite places .
every dish i 've tried as been excellent .
the peanut sauce on the satay is amazing .
coconut ice cream dessert is good for putting out the fire .
good place to go after an art or heard museum visit .
i find the mood to be nice and the lighting just right .
the food is well prepared and the alcoholic drinks are fantastic .
they need to add some more vegetarian dishes .
anyways , it 's a great place for a date : ) oh wild thaiger , how i do love thee !
actually , to be more specific , how i do love pad thai .
park there and walk a few steps south to wild thaiger .
especially with how bland the food is for a thai restaurant .
i prefer thai food that lights me up like a christmas tree .
i like this place .
although it gets really busy around noon .
my favorite dish is gapraogui .
the wild thaiger is the best kept thai restaurant secret on north central avenue .
my omnipresent dinner companion marcial and i , have been habitual customers since .
the restaurant atmosphere is very friendly and unpretentious .
the food is where the adventure begins .
do n't fret , you can always order more to go .
order hint : each plate is made to your specification .
she is the heart of the wild thaiger .
drive slow , this tiger is worth hunting in the concrete jungle .
that 's pretty much how i feel about wild thaiger .
( you are on notice , wild thaiger ! )
i think i gave it a fair shake .
update 5/19/2008 finally .
me and the thaiger are purring like happy kittens .
i 've discovered their yellow curry at lunch and it is dee lish !
prices are insanely low , tho the lunch menu is limited .
service is upbeat and more polished .
i think hello kitty is wildier than this cat .
i 've had crispier wafers from a priest .
i 've had tastier wafers from a priest .
i love the chef .
i 've had more action from a priest .
try new things .
but only after i do the rosary .
i am big on the yellow chicken curry - yum !
perhaps they are slipping , or more likely i am : ) the atmosphere is great .
i like everything from the tables and booths to the patio .
the service has always been top notch for me .
i love their pad thai .
a nice place does n't deserve that hassle .
how can this place possibly be too-cool ?
they also have drink specials on monday and wednesdays .
i has a shiraz instead which was fine .
bottomline , good , but i 've had better .
not great , not mind blowing , but not horrible .
its typically quiet which was perfect for girl 's day out and chatting .
service is unpredictable .
sometimes it is very good and sometimes it is very bad .
the pad thai here is delicious but has way too much chicken .
the kiew wan curry is very spicy and very good .
the spring rolls are also very tasty .
it is open sundays which is rare downtown .
i expect delicate , tender meats at a high end thai place .
i am very upset at the lack of sauce .
there is something about eggplant in green curry ... .
does n't make sense to me .
this results in a fajita-style cut of chicken that leaves me less than thrilled .
_ num _ min to get drink orders , another _ num _ to get the drinks .
this is good . ''
of course the service is good , they never have anything better to do .
maybe try another dish too .
phoenix yelpers - any other awesome thai places to try ?
i have had some good digestive experiences here .
i love that it 's right off the light rail too .
: ) the portions are large and they offer a wide variety of dishes .
they offer many asian beers and indochina-themed cocktails .
they have seating indoors and out with a patio view of central avenue .
the food is delicious and the drinks are really good .
the restaurant is very cozy and energetic .
extremely rare to find in a thai concept .
love knowing who is cooking your food and that the kitchen is well kept .
that makes me f-cking estatic !
i am happy to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow !
now , i 'm not an expert on thai cuisine .
i 'm not an expert on anything really .
but i know what i like .
in this instance , i like this place .
wild thaiger is located a few blocks north of the heard museum .
now , we just need to pick a date for dinner .
i can not wait !
i just wish it could hit them up on my lunch .
i prefer a bit spicier , maybe i should have asked for that .
parking in the back , or take the light rail .
this is a great place .
i order the same stuff every thai restaurant .
i love their appitizer veggie sampler , and their desserts are good too .
i recommend the thai custard .
phoenix is lucky to have this place .
that i have ever tasted .
it is worth it .
oh , gaprao gai , how i love thee .
able to relax and enjoy it !
but i like my thai food hot !
love this place and plan to return !
the dish is perfect w/out them .
galee gai is the cure-all for allergies , the flu or a hangover .
trust me , i know hangovers .
the waitresses are all amazing and beautiful and nice . )
i have never had a bad meal or experience here .
i may be a tad bit biased about the wild thaiger .
the curries are absolutely amazing .
the pad thai is amazing , and the kimow is excruciatingly spicy and tasty .
but perhaps the most attractive aspect of the restaurant is the vegetarian-friendly menu .
i love the corn fritters ... mmmm i love thaiger so i wanted to share the tastiness .
wild thaiger is in the heart of uptown phoenix .
food is great and very fresh .
they have nothing to hide .
prices are pretty standard at between 8.95-14.95 for dinner entrees .
all the people ask for it .
it 's safer '' .
if you 're not gluten-free - for sure go here for thai !
it 's amazing .
if you are , just be very very careful !
our tastes are often a match .
to be fair it was n't horrible ... but i certainly have had better .
i 'm so happy to have found a good thai place !
the drinks here are highly recommended .
i 'm not sure why i havent started making this at home .
oh also the staff is awesome .
i am hopping mad .
this is outrageous .
wild thaiger is off my list forever .
customer service at it 's worst !
they offer ample parking behind the restaurant and patio dining if you so choose .
thai hut is much better/cheaper/better service !
the sauce is savory , spicy , sweet , and rich .
the salmon pairs quite well with panang sauce , as do the tender scallops .
the veggie spring rolls here are okay , but not amazing .
the thai iced tea is standard , which is good .
i 've never had bad service here , and i come all the time .
if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it .
thai rama has much better food and service .
oh and you have to try the thai iced tea .
its mental how good it is .
enjoy !
great food and service i have n't been in a while but i remember being impressed .
a fine thai meal to have before a rock show downtown .
this place is really our favorite thai restaurant in phoenix area by far .
i have not had any veggie pad thai that is better anywhere else !
definitely do not order the spicy dishes if you ca n't take the heat .
check out the places i mention above .
it 's an adventure .
yum to the freakin ' yum .
also , i love the pun in the name .
it 's an eastern thing , dude .
just go .
anyway , a good place to remember on north central .
i usually order the yellow curry with chicken .
lunch hour is very busy so you might get stuck waiting for your server .
the corn fritters are mind blowing good !
i can only say that it was amazing !
i recommend trying this place if you like authentic thai food .
why ask about spice levels ?
we 've eaten here about _ num _ times now , and we are always delighted .
the beef panang is just killer .
the strips of beef are incredibly tender and of high quality .
the sauce , ohhhhhh the sauce .
personally , my favorite is the yellow curry .
yellow curry is my dish .
it 's absolutely the best here .
the steamed vegetables are so tender that they fall apart .
the little relish on the side is shockingly delicious and refreshing .
the duck sauce that comes with the fried rolls makes them worthwhile .
i know there 's something with peanut sauce ( satay ? )
that makes me happy .
appetizers and desserts are up to you .
if you like cellophane wrapped veggie rolls , they 're great here .
if you like coconut ice cream , do it .
it 's definitely thai ... but upgraded .
in my opinion , it 's perfect .
thai food is my new favorite .
how do you run out of something so basic ?
now i like that in a place !
so this place is legit , good service and good food .
they cook it perfectly .
just throw one in the bag .
what a great way to open up the meal .
i 'm in love with their pad thai !
i think i will be sticking with chinese and japanese .
this is the noodle-less pad thai , it is low carb but very tasty .
by the way , the regular pad thai is also wonderful .
i have always had great service and i have loved every dish i tried .
i work around the corner so come here once a month or so .
they 're soups are fantastic and so is their iced tea !
the staff here seems to resent it when thais come in .
my wife is thai .
read gary cs review before you waste money here .
