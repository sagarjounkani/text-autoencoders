and more unbelievably the pizza served was missing a portion .
`` the oven ate it '' - according to the waitress .
reasonably priced .
could n't be more happy with their service either .
they could use a fork upgrade , but the rice was nice .
i got the garlic chicken with vegetables with lo mein .
paid over $ _ num _ and it was pretty greasy and just very underwhelming .
i walked in and briefly fingered coats , feeling lost and confused .
`` have you spent a winter here before ? ''
she asked , eyeing my confused expression .
`` uh ... no , '' i admitted .
`` i just moved here from southern california .
she demanded instantly .
i shouted .
then we got down to coat-shopping .
checked champaign surplus and the price was exactly the same !
so i took the _ num _ 's .
i lost my receipt .
prior to this they were a north face , mountain hardwear , patagonia mill .
what a pleasant surprise this store was !
i was also hoping that as a surplus store they 'd carry more gear .
hubby found a cute cap here for our upcoming cold-weather trip .
went there today .
came here with my boyfriend to get some new hiking shoes .
i told him i was n't in the habit of saving receipts for socks .
he told me he could n't exchange them .
it was worth the drive .
i used to be afraid of this place as a closed-minded junior .
but i gave it a shot one day and wow .
anyway , plenty of other bars that would be happy to have my money .
if i were closer i would probably go more often .
i was really looking forward to hearing alexander spin some spooky music last night .
packed .
the bartender was amazing .
it made my night .
the show area was cool too .
the sound was great , the artist was better .
i danced my butt off , and i had a blast .
she discovered that i had prism , which was the cause of my headache .
i went to illini eye care before but they did not test for that .
highly recommended .
still , i found frames that i really liked and i 'm pretty picky .
good products , but very , very limited selection compared to their catalog .
to which , i said nothing ... but thought plenty i probably do not want to have a conversation with you about anything .
i went to do-it-best today for the first time .
i expected do-it-best to be small , stuffy , and overpriced .
i was wrong !
low-keyed , extraordinarily well stocked , highly organized , very clean , good prices .
thought it was just a paint store from the signage .
but the more i went , the less they seemed to want me there .
recently i found myself in a bit of a hair rut .
even if you like contemporary to unique , they got it down .
i was a little bit worried because i saw his hands shaking a bit ?
at the end , i was very pleased with my hair .
it was a nice distraction to have around : ) when i walked in for my appointment i was a little surprised .
someone immediately took my coat and amy introduced herself right away .
she decided on color and went to work .
both times , it was doug .
i pictured myself ending up with a mohawk , or a gigantic japanese-style quiff .
i recently moved to chicago after graduating from u of i this spring .
i just got out of my hair appointment about _ num _ min .
ago , and i could n't be happier .
my stylist was amy , who was very friendly , relaxed , and confident .
they were always happy to have me there .
quality of work : * i have never dyed my hair here , only had hair cuts .
he took his time cutting it and was very thorough .
jake was amazing , skilled and friendly .
i was impressed and readily recommended the salon to everyone i knew .
not to mention , my hair was cut after it was dried and curled .
i was throughly disappointed .
jake was the person that cut my hair and he was awesome .
just got my devacut with doug last week .
we ended my cut with a hug .
much more down-to-earth than one might expect from the downtown vibe .
doug ended up completely butchering my hair .
also , the salon was a sauna !
the other stylists stared and awkwardly eavesdropped while i was getting my hair cut .
overall , it was a really horrible experience .
kate cut my curly hair and completely , utterly butchered it .
it literally was meant to destroy my appearance .
dealing with ippatsu was a joy from start to finish !
doug was wonderful .
i brought along a bag of the products i use .
doug spent 1-1/2 hours with me .
: ) in truth , the experience was great !
he seemed very knowledgable .
jake was these two things combined .
but i finally found it !
amy did an amazing job !
i really enjoyed my overall experience at ippatsu salon .
i liked the decoration and water was available in the waiting area .
it was a comfortable temperature and was a pleasant place to be .
i got there a bit early and my appointment started on time .
amy was friendly and seemed very knowledgable .
johnathon was friendly , enthusiastic , and did a fantastic job !
i would highly recommend johnathon and ippatsu to anyone who asks !
: - ) i saw amy for a hair cut .
i had long curly hair that was weighed down and damaged .
i would say it is the best haircut i have ever had !
she listens and gave me the look i was going for .
enough said .
i did n't realize either time until i got to work .
done with this mcd 's .
i had the number one .
the coke from the fountain was fine .
my first mcdonald when i got to america .
the second time i went was a tuesday night .
so the service was great , right ?
drinks took literally _ num _ minutes .
then my buddy got his blue moon draft in a plastic cup .
went here wednesday night with a friend .
we sat outside and the outside area is really nice .
we ordered the nachos and my friend really liked them .
overall it was a nice place to sit outside and visit with friends .
it was not crowded at all .
i went for the dollar beer again and met a friend for dinner .
i had the grilled chicken buffalo wrap .
the homemade potato chips that they served with the wrap were excellent .
plenty of tv 's that put a premium on illini sports .
she was always polite and very conscious of any discomfort .
never heard or experienced any thing like that before .
the crow they said would cost _ num _ .
i went here for their new customer cleaning discount .
i made the appointment last week .
i showed up _ num _ minutes before my 2:00 o'clock appointment as requested .
i left .
judging by the other reviews here , i clearly dodged a bullet .
they also cooked the vegetables up fresh for you .
i was able to have a fulfilling meal and take some home for later .
just same things fried in same sauce .
i did not get them at panda express at the mall .
after completing my order they legitimately offered me something that was unavailable .
i ordered a two entree orange chicken ( my fave ) with white rice .
she asked if i wanted to wait or get something else .
being that i only drink diet soda , it meant must go without .
i got water instead .
it was kinda vinegary .
on saturday , they had free pizza for comic book day .
and a guy dressed up as iron man .
but i was disappointed when i stopped by to check it out .
and not very densely stocked .
i noticed a few cool indie comics , including paping .
i really like trade paperbacks/graphic novels and the selection was pretty limited .
however , for anything else i would n't count on it .
or drawn & quarterly .
so many more comics could fit into this store .
there could be so much more awesomeness going on here !
boys , girls , challenged , gifted .
service was laid back , friendly , and helpful .
would certainly recommend and return .
extremely friendly staff helped kids pick out a few free comic books .
we 'll be back - they just made us new customers .
i purchased a viola here in february for _ num _ months same as cash .
the person argued with me and altimately refused my payment .
my experience was different .
this place rocked .
i never would have known about it except through word of mouth .
it was kind of offensive , but whatever .
recently i visited a handful of international food stores in champaign , il .
far east market was the most impressive among them .
their produce selection was incredible .
there was a variety of mushrooms .
it could be interesting fruit , seafood , packaged goodies , etc .
my sister nodded in agreement and gave a funny look .
i bought produce and drove it home to chicago .
i went in once and lasted less than _ num _ minutes .
it was filthy and smelled so rotten i wanted to vomit .
my sister went there yesterday to pick up some noodles .
rate it _ num _ because its like the only asian grocery store in town .
i was grinning so hard when i finally made it here .
it was so funny thinking back on these reviews as i was checking out .
like , i was expecting something revolting .
i found my nuoc mam , chili oil , and fresh lemongrass .
i would avoid the meat .
and i would avoid the produce .
just left the store , great employees .
produce was awesome !
got a durian today .
taking a close a look at the ingredients before buying would help .
they just put expired food at the most obvious place on the shelf .
i saw a young lady helping another customer and asked her .
headed towards the cashier and realized i 'd left my store coupon home .
here i was , willing to spend .
would not do again .
= ) they did n't charge for any of this either .
adjustments , i was extremely satisfied .
my visit with the optometrist 's office in lenscrafters was very pleasant .
next , i stopped by their shop to select new frames .
i settled on a pair of everyday glasses and sunglasses .
i walked out of lenscrafters feeling fairly positive about the whole transaction ... ... until today .
was there something weird about the lenses ?
did they stop manufacturing the type of frames i chose ?
he literally saved the day for me .
now this seemed insane since my frames somehow got lenses in them inititally .
her excuse was that my frames were to `` beat up '' .
i scheduled an appointment , then received a call the day before the appointment .
so i rescheduled the appointment for 3:20 .
again , the day before the appointment i received another call .
this time i did not reschedule .
when i asked to speak with manager , she was not taking calls .
what really impressed me was the amount of starter instruments for kids .
i was told they will only price match their own webiste .
store review : pros : large selection of toys cons : higher than average prices hidden deals : sign up for a tru credit card to earn cash back on purchases we had our travel system picked after much research/trial .
we wasted all the time we had on that and got nothing else done .
canned mushrooms ?
and the clumps were cold .
too bad they would n't let me though .
so i canceled the ordered and kept on walking .
mind you , he had no idea what i had already paid !
okay , i did n't get the mushrooms .
but i thought the food here was terrific .
i just had the stuffed pizza , on special for a ridiculously low price .
i made the mistake of stopping by on and ordering a pizza there .
it took like _ num _ minutes ( which is to be expected ) .
did i forget to mention that there is a cat in the store ?
i was very emotional and the staff was very understanding .
they were able to set her leg and send her home very quickly .
each time we went back , they were very loving and compassionate .
i brought my dog in after she pulled out some stitches .
the original surgery itself was n't much more than that !
but they knew they had me cornered , and they ran with it , they also charged just shy of $ _ num _ to clean the wound ( ! )
, but gave us back a dog that was covered in blood .
this was not by any means my first experience at the aec .
they could care less about your pet .
i called ahead and they were ready and waiting .
one day i thought my dog have injested something poisonous .
i found the aspca poison control number .
she ended up needing surgery to remove her eye .
upon checkout , i received excellent discharge instructions .
they also called within the week to check on her again .
helped my guy with urine in his crystals a few months ago .
once again their friendly service came to the rescue !
the store where she got rejected !
the clerk was staring at me like i was some kind of a kleptomaniac .
the shop was just okay for me .
well made fabrics , that will last many years with amazing style .
i gulped back shame as i reached for the doorknob to leave .
that night it smelled like someone had been smoking in a flowery meadow .
also , some other indian guy accidentally barged in my room .
we waited too long to book and this was all we could find .
the sheets in the bed looked clean but they were very worn .
i decided to skip a morning shower .
i just did n't want to touch anything in there .
the lobby was under construction and the staff was very pleasant .
i screamed , my boyfriend squished it with a napkin .
we booked the room through priceline , only paid $ _ num _ for room .
it was so gross !
( of course my hubby would point out they had old tvs too . )
my hubby called to say he could n't stay there .
he went next door to la quinta for $ _ num _ .
because i booked through priceline i was not allowed a refund .
room size and cleanliness were acceptable and so was was the continental breakfast .
the room smell made the stay uncomfortable .
i was n't completely pleased with how quickly everything grew back ... grrrr .
i went to kane & co twice to get my hair done .
not to mention , her scissors were not sharp .
ursa cut my hair ( she 's new to the salon ) .
she did a fantastic job !
i felt like she really cared and is a very talented stylist .
i would go back !
i went in to see jillanna back in march and had a fabulous experience .
carly did a lovely job on my hair .
ursa always did an amazing job and i ca n't recommend her enough .
it took me _ num _ years of college to find this place .
in fact , it was awful .
i reluctantly accepted the response and scheduled my appointment .
i reluctantly paid the $ _ num _ and left .
they talked on the phone the next day and he was extremely rude .
i finally found my perfect salon !
i wanted to cut my hair short and she really catered to my needs .
i just came in today for the first time and saw jenn .
today she did a partial foil , using both high and low lights .
it really brightened things up without going over the top .
so happy to of found the perfect hair stylist for me !
i was a walk in and they were great !
the staff was very friendly , and the price was great .
when my stylist johnathon moved here from another salon i happily followed !
they said they had no record of my appointment being made .
some got it close but others would always fall short of my expectations .
went there after seeing so many five star reviews on yelp .
and the second visit totally ruined my hair .
after a few months , i gave a second try .
i totally obeyed their stylist recommendation and this time was even worse !
not recommended .
then she blow-dried and curled my hair for me and it looked amazing .
i would definitely see her for another dye appointment !
came here for a drastic haircut today and loved it !
i had a bad experience the first time cutting my hair at the salon .
danielle took care of all of my waxing needs .
melissa did a wonderful job !
she got my requests spot on , preserving my hairstyle .
loved my color and cut .
i went here to find out about wedding dress alterations .
i would not recommend .
the alterations took about a week .
i also found her rude , unwilling to answer questions .
she actually did alterations for my wedding dress and it was perfect .
they did a good job on taking in the skirts and hemming .
however i did think that they were a bit pricey .
and she still managed it !
kay jewelers was one of those times .
i said i saw what i wanted online and could they order it ?
i even had a business card and she gave a weird look .
she did n't know the warranty plans when i asked her .
even sold the wrong size ring to us after we tried it on .
could have been one of those days ... consumer beware i live in coffee shops .
i would give it _ num _ 1/2 stars if i could give half-stars .
i lived in champaign-urbana for nine years .
kopi was my favorite .
relaxed laid-back atmosphere , cool music , friendly service .
i really liked this place .
i tried the pesto turkey panini which was fabulous .
i ended up sitting at a very uncomfortable table .
but studying - towards the back would be better .
luckily someone left and i grabbed a different table .
its super dim and crowded ambiance rubbed me a little the wrong way .
however , every single table was taken by some student !
i also was n't too impressed with the snicker-doodles that we ordered .
kopi was a random choice & it fits my purposes perfectly !
i would recommend this place to others .
needs filtered water ?
the espresso 's also not as good as it could be .
if only we could combine aroma cafe and cafe kopi .
then downtown champaign would finally have the perfect coffee house .
come on , dude .
i used to live basically upstairs and this was my go to spot .
thankfully by reference of a patient of mine i was referred to kopi .
the drinks themselves were rich and delicious .
i really would want to avoid this place because of the service .
first of all , it was sweltering outside and i ordered iced mochas .
although i would love a _ num _ .
highly recommended .
cafe kopi did not disappoint !
we all finished off with some sweets .
i came here with a friend hearing good things .
i had the mango italian soda .
last friday i visited with my daughter who lives in champaign .
you guessed it , coffee !
it was pretty warm so i had their iced vanilla latte .
i had their iced ginger cookies and they were really good .
what kind of place would ever serve a latte in a tumbler ?
for the listed reasons , the latte was given zero stars .
i had some time to kill a couple times in champaign .
i tried this place and also cafe aroma .
both were nice but i definitely would go back to cafe kopi .
the food was really delicious and the coffee was excellent too .
the atmosphere was very pleasant and the people seemed good-natured .
located this place on yelp and stopped for lunch .
we ordered a sandwich and a coffee , which both were great .
everything i ordered was suggested to me by the man taking my order .
the turkey sandwich he suggested was absolutely delicious .
wish i lived closer so that i could come here more often !
once i had an oreo brownie here , and it was beyond terrible .
the owner and staff could not be friendlier !
i could honestly work here for hours at a time .
this coffee shop got me through college .
when i first started going there , they served beer and wine .
it was amazing .
and i used to work at a coffee shop in chicago .
i thoroughly enjoyed it as i read my book on this quiet sunday morning .
it was definitely a nice option for those that are not mocha lovers . )
about that straight espresso though ... the barista clearly had no idea what she was doing .
was looking for a good espresso while driving through , found it here .
would go again when in the area .
i thoroughly enjoyed my time at cafe kopi .
i was there on a tuesday afternoon for a couple of hours .
internet speeds were great and the food was fantastic .
i ordered a turkey and swiss from the sandwich menu .
the art was beautiful and the atmosphere was on point .
upon entering , i was definitely feeling the relaxing vibe .
i could definitely see myself studying here if i went to school here .
it was quiet , chill , and clean .
another thing i liked .
unfortunately , neither barista greeted us , even after eye contact .
and there were five of us .
immediately overwhelmed by the ` oh-you 're - not-a-hipster-like-us ? '
ordering was as pleasant as the barista 's demeanor , what a surprise .
/ sarcasm opted for the cafe late , which turned out to be delicious !
was n't too hot , was n't too cold .
fresh made food items and great coffee also .
i had the goat cheese sandwich with pesto on side .
friend had the brie/turkey sandwich and said also very good .
well done .
staff was friendly and my drink came out quickly .
not burnt like some places .
not a word , and i even gave them a tip !
it was great that they open late ( until midnight ) on most days .
hands down my favorite cafe to get work done .
just stopped in for a cappuccino and a little dessert after a big dinner .
cappuccino was also perfectly acceptable and hit the spot .
i ordered a latte with almond milk .
i ordered a red tea latte , which was really delicious !
my only complaint was that the place was a little crammed !
but i had very high expectations going in , so overall wonderful ( : my favorite coffee in town .
it was fresh , light and tasty .
man was i disappointed by my experience here .
it was .
so i said , `` do you think it 's the machine ?
could you type it in or run it again ?
the woman said `` no i do n't need to run it again .
your card was rejected .
highly recommended !
i eagerly awaited my delicious delectables with my clown fish table marker in tow .
back on track , it eerily resembled the white chocolate mocha at starbucks .
spot on resembled it , which is n't bad .
i was expecting something unique and bold just like the cafe kopi .
though i loved everything else - service , patrons , atmosphere and yummy food .
had a delicious light lunch after the champaign historical walking tour in april .
and that was the first real live cream soda that i 've ever had .
that was amazing !
once i came here extremely sick and i kept coughing .
met a colleague here for a meeting , and it was the perfect spot .
free wifi with no password required .
they also had plenty of seating .
i was just there and saw a sale sign for an ott-lite .
the sign said _ num _ watt on sale for _ num _ regular _ num _ - great deal .
however , it rang up as _ num _ .
i brought him the sign and he reluctantly called the manager .
i love this store , this was my first time there on a sunday .
the service was very friendly and quick and so was the check out .
also bought some fabric for a very good price .
my last visit was for some material for a table cloth .
the person cutting the fabric was very nice and the check out was fast .
i was in and out in less than _ num _ minutes .
saved me a bunch of money !
i burned my tongue eating it but i could n't stop myself : ) .
most importantly , our waiter was awesome .
he was friendly , engaging and ultimately really helpful .
i loved me some nitaya .
he made a reference to `` pedagogy of teh oppressed . ''
almost everything was well over $ _ num _ per meal , even the staple stuff .
you fucked it up ! ''
i really enjoyed the pad thai from this place .
i ordered the spiciness level at american hot .
it was amazing - just on the verge of being too spicy for me .
the tom kah was fairly good .
first off , our waiter only understood about _ num _ % of what we said .
he checked with the chef and came back and verified my suspicions .
he did n't understand and sent the manager over .
wanted thai while on champaign for work .
tried this place and it was good but very small portions .
after the disappointing crab rangoon , i was served my chicken pad kee mao .
i ordered it spicy .
it was n't really bad but it just was n't great either .
i did however enjoy the ambience and the comfy booths .
we ate tonight at nitaya , and our food was excellent .
i had the pineapple chicken curry and my wife had a modified number _ num _ .
we had potstickers for an appetizer and sticky rice and mango for dessert .
the service was great and no problems with english understanding him or us .
first we went for the lunch special and had green curry .
the curry was savory and creamy .
i had the padthai , which was excellent .
this was the must disgusting restaurant i have eaten at in years .
we ordered the dumplings and they arrived freezer cold .
ok , could have lived with that .
green curry arrived with hair in both the rice and the curry dish .
next up was going to the bathroom .
my husband and i went there and i ordered the pad thai .
i took a couple bites and noticed a hair in it .
i was obviously disgusted and i told the waiter .
i said i could n't eat it and he turned and left .
he ran away because he did n't want to deal with it .
i tried to get his attention but he was ignoring us !
the sauce was almost creamy .
they did n't do that or even try .
i ordered the pad-see-ew and was glad the chicken resembled chicken .
four years ago i mistakenly ordered hot and it burned twice !
reasonably priced & great food !
that said , this place was great .
the setting was fun , service was great , mango sticky rice was fantastic .
had a lunch special and spring roll for appetizer .
forgot the name of the lunch special .
it was a stir-fried meat and vegetable dish with rice .
it was too oily for me .
thank to the lunch special the price was not expensive .
i did have a small problem with the service .
we had to approach her to ask for whatever we needed .
besides that , it was okay .
it was the first place i had thai .
ordered mock duck curry and mussamun curry .
both seemed very oily and extremely watery .
the consistency of the curry was just not there .
potato in the curry tasted like it was canned .
this was the worst thai food i 've ever had !
they used canned mango for my mango and sticky rice dessert .
the chicken stays were microwaved .
this experience was very disappointing .
the older woman who started to serve me was not very nice at all .
the thai iced tea was delicious !
my friends ' dishes looked delicious as well .
they did n't seem to have many servers working .
i felt like it was a little expensive for what i got .
the girl at the counter was polite and friendly .
she helped me select a delicious meal .
food : i felt both soup and curry to be very watery .
the curry was good a lot of curry not a lot of shrimp .
but again the flavors of not the consistency were in point .
refused to refund fraud charges !
me and my friend were double charged on our credit cards !
but when i came in she would n't refund me !
she told me i should have handled it that night .
i had to dispute it from the credit card company .
the food was n't even good : ( update : after _ num _ months the credit card issue was resolved .
then , my boyfriend got food poisoning for the first time in years .
i called the owner to inform her and ask for a refund .
the conversation with the owner was unbelievable , laughable at best .
she demanded to know what else we ate .
and if he was allergic to anything he ordered .
she was defensive , argumentative , and inappropriate .
at one point she hung up on me !
no complaints and if you want great thai food ... go here ordered delivery with grubhub on a friday afternoon .
delivery was much faster than expected .
the rangoons were underwhelming .
they tasted good but appeared to be seriously lacking any crab .
my pad thai beef was very good .
it had a semi-sweet , nutty flavor and blended together quite well .
the beef seemed to be of decent quality , and tender .
the portion was fairly large , too .
my other issue was the fairly high cost .
overall , the food was good but i felt very high priced .
i did n't have any major problems .
they had a quick and friendly maintenance staff .
people might know this because their apartments fill up fast .
lived in _ num _ e white st , champaign for half a year .
signing with jsm was a pleasant , hassle-free experience .
this underlined for me that they are not in the business of deception .
move-in was a breeze .
it was a rental miracle .
and one just crawled into my blender !
after this incident i checked my electric water boiler .
and that was only a notification for construction on my own apartment .
did you contact us about all the floors above us getting hammered to bits ?
if you did , you would n't have done this .
would you personally have consented to this ?
the water was black after multiple passes .
jsm staggered the floors so that there is perpetual construction for a semester .
today i got my apartment back .
construction started on march _ num _ , _ num _ .
jsm left me in the dust .
i talked to a lawyer yesterday .
its honestly such a disappointment because i loved jsm .
i could n't stop raving about you guys to my friends .
they allegedly sent in a cleaning crew ... thanks ?
the couch ( theirs ) was singularly horrible .
throughout construction it managed to absorb every fleck of dust and debris .
everything i touched ... my hand came up gray .
oh right , because everyone would see what you 're really like .
i did n't even get a notification about the showing either .
you did n't see the huge pitfalls of this landlord .
i was also charged for floor cleaning .
after i touched roach shit !
if this rating were solely for their manners , jsm would receive 6/5 stars .
there were even roaches in my stove .
i almost drank a roach that had crawled into my water boiler .
i was reading a guide on reddit for getting rid of roaches .
i could n't believe this guy thought he had it bad .
jsm came to my building weekly to clean the laundry area and hallways .
everything was ok after move in although the furnishings were dated and quite worn .
considering it was college living we let a lot of things slide .
the apartment itself was disgusting ' !
i fell sick the first week .
when i first came in the filters were dirty and disgusting !
by far the worst place i ever loved at in my life .
so i went to see dr. gu .
highly recommended !
yes , they were the original killer-beer-selection place before there was a blind pig .
i finally ventured past the delicious burgers and tried the elaine 's salad .
the buffalo wings were decent , but not fantastic .
you could say we 're regulars .
not loaded with smelly college kids either !
fresh brewed iced tea always nice .
_ num _ ) the food was absolutely delicious .
tried farren 's out for the first time last night and wow .
the burgers were a bit pricey but quality was very good .
the service is straight forward , rapid and no-questions asked cooperative .
the suffix `` feel '' was a little generous , i thought .
chipped paint on the walls .
given all this , the $ _ num _ entrees on the specials menu were surprising .
to top it off , service was poor .
everyone seemed nice , but improbably busy with things that did n't involve customers .
the kobe beef burger was probably the best burger i 've ever had .
it was so tender and juicy .
it was hard to taste much the rest of the day .
i would suggest a fountain drink or a beer .
service was friendly and astonishingly quick .
salad came back in probably under _ num _ minutes from the time i ordered it .
so that was good .
and the salad tasted great .
the salad looked horrible .
and the pink dressing on top of it did n't help .
so seven of us gave it a try for lunch today .
cauliflour was a bit underfried .
wings were ok .
obviously come here for the burger !
my burger came with a side of tortilla chips for around $ _ num _ .
we were able to sample a beer before ordering .
i got to say the service is exceptional though .
to be honest , i was a little disappointed .
i had the bacon feta blue cheese burger and it was terrific .
onion rings and chips were all great .
service was very good .
never had a bad meal since then , though .
i could eat one every day if i could afford it .
grilled onions and mushroom , drizzled with a heafty ranch dressing .
not watered down like some places .
i liked this place .
i loved the fries .
it might help shed some illumination as to why : `` farren 's !
* beer consumed * `` ooh , menu !
fried portabello - battered , deep-fried and served with ranch ?
and the immense discomfort of feeling like i could possibly literally explode .
how did i spend $ _ num _ at farren 's ?
i thought we split checks that night ... oh ... we did . ''
i also decided to splurge and get the fresh-made potato chips .
the staff was friendly and the food came out fast .
they were warm and the truffle salt was genius on these chips .
so , went here on a busy saturday night .
for burgers that cost around $ _ num _ , i would expect a lot more .
hidden gem of c-u .
the siblings and i came here to visit after they arrived in town .
i did n't eat anything tonight as i 'd eaten earlier .
they all had fabulous food .
i shot photos of most all the food .
there was two salads a black bean veggie burger and a mother load burger .
there was fresh cut fries and chips .
everybody loved the food , the atmosphere , and drinks .
the burgers were just as good as i remembered .
ate here early sep-12 .
had n't been in over a year .
why did i wait so long ?
got the russell burger and it was delish .
got chips and salsa instead of fries .
so they got the good beer covered .
recommended !
i enjoyed their veggie burger .
it came with a cajun remoulade - yum !
they had a decent selection of drinks ( wine , beers , spirits ) .
i almost missed it !
we had a green chile cheese burger and a mushroom swiss cheese burger .
got the chipotle bison burger .
finally went here after hearing how good it was .
overall , i was pleased .
i got a bacon burger with bleu cheese crumbles .
i found it odd that the default side is tortilla chips .
it was fresh-tasting and not too spicy .
they had about _ num _ beers on tap and a healthy list of bottles .
prices were n't too bad either .
i tried it twice , it underwhelmed on both occasions .
will definitely come back whoa , mama , was that a delicious burger .
that 's ok , he had spunk .
a little place tucked away in an alley ?
i went here with a group of friends on a friday night .
the fries were delicious . )
, but we had no problems still getting our correct checks .
the burger was really good .
the service was n't good .
went on a friday night in october with my sister .
had a burger that was covered in pulled pork , bacon , and cheese .
my sister had a chicken pesto wrap thing that was also fresh and yummy .
service was slow .
and what came next is what made me determined not to visit any again .
we tried the fried ravioli which were served on a bed of wilting lettuce .
i would like another . ''
they were great .
served , as i recall , with a very tasty salad .
about the service - it was lunch time .
came here on a packed saturday night with a group of _ num _ people .
we were seated after a good 20-minute wait .
it was probably an hour between us entering the door and getting our food .
what were they thinking ?
so , we turned and left .
was n't quite the same , but it was still very tasty .
fresh cut potatoes fried in canola oil ... yes please !
the patty was very thick and juicy , and the buns were fantastic .
i was desperate to try this place .
the host was warm and welcomed us in .
there was some sort of roux sauce on the side that was equally phenomenal .
neither of these were so great .
they were a bit gamey .
service : i found the service to be good .
other comments : definitely recommended to visit at least once .
service was great , very attentive even if they were swamped .
the waiters were knowledgeable and friendly , but not overbearing .
pretty much upon entry i was congratulated for finding the place .
this salad was sooo good .
always considered one of the best luncheon spots in downtown champaign .
glad i finally got to try this place .
the burger did n't disappoint .
got the spicoli .
it was so flavorful !
the burger was perfectly cooked too ( generous amount ... ) .
i was so full .
got the fries ( you pay extra for these ) .
the fries were good too .
amazing burgers , had once would go again except the wait was pretty long .
solid place based purely on service .
the last time i was there the food was good but really slow .
our party left without being served .
i detected some truffle flavor which i turn a nose on .
the standard side of tortilla chips was pretty decent as well .
i counted only a couple servers but they were great and helpful .
well , the rumor was certainly confirmed .
everyone ordered a burger and we got the homemade chips for an appetizer .
these were good and a pretty large portion too .
the burger itself was large and very well put together .
french fries were really tasty , too !
kobe burger cooked to chefs liking was perfect .
the burgers and hand cut fries are amazing .
i would honestly pay double for the burger and still be happy .
the burger and fries i had at this place were delicious !
fantastic food , enjoyed the small resturant over big chain .
service was good as well .
waited said they were just voted one of the best burger joints in town .
the burger i had at this joint was amazing .
it was a terribly crowded feeling .
we had the fire burger and the russell burger .
everyone got their food in about _ num _ minutes .
i ordered the veggie burger and the homemade chips .
i ate everything on my plate .
the food and service was exceptional .
i ordered a strawberry salad and it was phenomenal .
nice atmosphere , the food was typical american pub grub .
you might lie to yourself and say you will only eat half .
out server was super nice and very stylish to boot .
i had a motherload .
and oh it was .
i hit the jackpot .
i ordered it.medium rare .
it was a.dry juiceless burger.well done for sure .
pretty well hidden , overlooked , but absolutely wonderful .
it quickly became a favorite for me and the guys .
i had the regular with blue cheese sauce !
it was delicious !
as good as advertised .
burger was great , and the service was friendly .
since i love burgers , he suggested that we go to farren 's .
i was so surprised when we walked up to the building .
there was a short line when we came in .
i ordered the spicoli without mushrooms and added the blue cheese topping .
the burger was very good , but needed more bacon .
they were a tad bit overcooked .
the floor just felt oily underneath my feet .
the bathroom was ick .
and worn .
all of them rocked !
they were huge , fresh and juicy .
we got fries with them and could not come close to finishing it all .
the fries were really good too , not too greasy or salty .
the guys working there were all super friendly and casual .
wonderful food , fantastic laid back service ... .
last night , i had the veggie burger .
i was sure to ask for all the extra fixings .
even so , they were still a little skimpy on the tomato .
beef lovers would give this place _ num _ stars easily .
so , the lady 's sister hit a car in a parking lot somewhere .
so , it took _ num _ months but i finally gave farren 's another shot .
we walked in and asked for a table for two .
i was astounded at her attitude .
the bacon cheeseburger was the best burger i 've ever had .
fries and soup were also very yummy .
they could at the very least greet their customers and let them know the wait time .
even after we were seated it took forever to get something to drink ( even after ordering drinks it took over _ num _ minutes ) .
it was fine , i guess , but why is it so expensive ?
i had the ` spicoli ' .
completely overrated .
the bun was dry , and cold .
farren 's did not disappoint !
i had the `` russell . ''
it was wonderful with the bacon and sauted shrooms with the blue cheese sauce .
my wife had a the standard bacon cheeseburger with american .
it was very flavorful and just the right amount of peppery !
everything was exceptional !
the food was good , but not spectacular .
i got the russell burger with fries .
the fries were pretty good .
and my friend got the onion rings which were on point .
i would come back at not peak hours .
plenty of drinks , and my soft drink got refilled post haste .
i asked to return it and bring a well done .
when they brought another one it still was pink !
after our lunch both of us felt really bad .
and our stomachs felt sick !
definitely it was the last time that we chosen this place i asked to return it and bring a well done .
when they brought another one it still was pink !
after our lunch both of us felt really bad .
and our stomachs felt sick !
solid burger , always cooked appropriately and always delicious .
the buffalo wings were amazing-crunchy , juicy , and meaty !
the house made bleu cheese we legit too !
our waiter was awesome and kept it real !
he recommended the russell burger which did not disappoint .
had the fire burger medium rare at lunch today with fries .
not to spicy for me , and i could have doubled the peppers .
before 11:45 this place had a line at the door to be seated .
substituted the chips for fries and the $ _ num _ was worth it .
portion size was big .
always checked up on the table .
good food and relaxed atmosphere !
had the russell burger with onion rings .
husband had the same burger with fries .
food was excellent and service was fast .
both were big portions and filling , but mediocre quality meat and produce .
i really liked the burgers and the truffled chips were awesome , however ... she grabbed some menus brought them the table sat them down and walked away .
never said a word never put down her phone .
apparently the phone conversation was more important than the customer .
returned at suggestion of in-laws .
mostly empty , but _ num _ minutes until we were sat .
burger was great , fries were good and serving size was large .
the blue cheese tasted like ranch .
similar burger and fries at murphys would be half that price .
when you just need some red meat , come here for a yummy burger !
ordered coffee and server was going to add sugar/cream .
oh boy was i excited !
the place was pretty clean .
i got a double scoop in a waffle cone for about $ _ num _ .
the ham was just awful and there was way too much cheese .
they got my business from ine of their competitors simpky by being so nice .
no bike rack , so brought bike in .
did not allow it and could not offer an alternative location .
they served us quickly and with a smile .
they even offered us some free donuts since they were about to close .
i was pleasantly surprised at such great service this late at night !
they said it would be a week .
i gave yong 's a delicate shirt to repair .
we discussed the repair and what i did n't want them to do .
my shirt was ruined and it could n't be undone !
unlike the poster below i did n't find them particularly polite or apologetic .
yong 's revived my favorite pair of skinny corduroy pants !
nuf said had my greek letters embroidered on a couple of my own personal items .
paintings and candles accent a ceiling painted with grapevines .
highly recommended .
even the clientele was less offensive than average .
they also wont accomodate any dietary restricitions .
i heard that this restaurant is closing soon .
so my coworkers and i went to try it out .
they joined in and kept up !
i had the eggplant napoleon and it was deeelish !
i used to love the great impasta .
it was my restaurant of choice .
if there was a night out to be had , it started here !
however , as time went on , the food quality slowly started to slip .
they stopped warming the bread before bringing it to the table .
the service started getting harder to find .
i loved this place in the beginning , but sadly had to say farewell .
i thought i 'd give the impasta another try .
they were lifeless , unappealing and bland .
as we left , we were stopped .
they used to have good , homey , tasty food .
of course , we expected a small piece of freshly cooked tuna .
my stomach did n't thank me .
my friend barely touched her salad , and returned it uneaten .
the staff behaved as if nothing was wrong .
my husband and i went with our families who were helping us move in .
when we arrived , we were promptly seated at our reserved table .
how was the food we actually ordered ?
my mother ordered the salmon , which came rare .
he told her `` it 's supposed to be that way . ''
you could n't pay me to go back .
i had the chance to eat here over dad 's weekend this past fall .
the food was overpriced for the level of quality .
update - finally went to the new lincoln square mall location .
i recommended the place to my friends and we went there for dinner yesterday .
my friend and i had the saffron risotto and it was horrible .
it was n't creamy , in fact , it was soupy and bland .
the shrimp was overcooked and tough .
worse , i could n't even taste a hint of saffron .
needless to say we were not impressed .
another friend had the mushroom and asparagus linguine with prosciutto .
the pasta was of an unappetizing soft texture and the dish was overly greasy .
the prosciutto tasted more like salted pork .
their only redeeming feature was the crab cake appetizer .
i would go back , but get one of their good salads instead .
anyway , i decided upon the great impostor , er , impasta .
service was slow and perfunctory .
the meal started with bread , olive oil , and cheese for the dipping .
the oil seemed decent enough but the cheese was not parmigiano reggiano .
i ordered a glass of the house chianti , which was drinkable .
for my appetizer , i chose the sausage in crust .
the sausage was unremarkable and under-seasoned and the crust was bone dry .
the small side of greens was nicely dressed but rather limp .
the olives appeared to be sliced black olives from a can .
the linguine was cut so short that it defied twirling on the fork .
i indulged myself with dessert on this special holiday .
the latter was fine , the former was nothing special .
took _ num _ minute for a waitress to come to our table .
it was n't even a waitress ... the hostess was the one who helped us .
took _ num _ minutes to get our food after we ordered .
spent _ num _ hours in the place ... was n't even crowded .
food was good that is about it .
we asked for a discount and what did we get ... _ num _ % .
we saved _ num _ dollars after spending _ num _ hours of our time there .
had dinner there .
my friend ordered a daily special which contained salmon .
the salmon tasted very good - cooked just enough .
i had a chicken pasta .
it was okay .
i spent more than twenty dollar in total for my meal .
food was amazing and service was exceptional .
i went there today based on yelp reviews .
i dropped the car off and walked to golden harbor .
they just needed to be cleaned !
it was not spicy and i had pepper jack cheese on it .
the chipolte sauce did not have any flavor at all .
i could taste the bread over everything else .
i stooped in on my way home on a mon .
the place was empty .
i ordered a tuna sub .
the nice guy behind the counter told me they were out of tuna salad .
he said the manager had n't ordered a supply truck for the week .
i ordered a `` specialty , '' a bmt .
i got it home and sat down to eat .
clean and eugenia was very nice .
they were out of grilled chicken but there plenty of sandwiches to choose from .
maybe if it were slightly bigger it could carry more ... um , were we in the same plato 's closet ?
most of the stuff looked pretty cheap and teenybopperish to me .
i used to hate plato 's closet .
i found a good navy p coat though for next to nothin though .
they were clean and really professional .
i thought that everybody was really cool and professional .
the price was extremely fair , and i tipped him obscenely to compensate .
he said this repeatedly throughout the conversation .
he just spent half an hour being kind of elitist .
the whole attitude was bizarre .
he confirmed that he was just talking about pre-nazi german swastikas .
i would n't dream of going anywhere else .
otherwise , loved the vibe of the place .
looked through the tattoos while there , very creative and inventive pieces .
i would definitely go here again ( for my next tattoo ) !
i went here to get an industrial piercing .
the guy who did it was really nice .
several months later i figured it was time to put the bar in .
it was a little hard to do , but i loved it .
that was pretty disappointing to hear .
i just did n't have the best experience .
dustin took care of us .
he was friendly and did an awesome job on my friend and me .
i saw him do a tattoo on another friend .
went here to finish off my triple helix piercing .
he redid that one and was not understanding where i actually wanted the piercing .
by this time i was done .
my husband & i did a walk in .
it was my very first tattoo , he was not pressuring at all .
he walked me through the steps .
it was very very cool .
we would definitely return .
i just walked in and he was able to do it quickly .
my most recent was done by michael t hastings .
i went to new life for my first tattoo based on the high reviews .
someone told me this place has the best white russians in town .
the rose bowl is a dusty , hole-in-the-wall bar that nonetheless has charm .
the first time was so yummy i was ecstatic for the second .
i loved moonstruck !
i really missed having a chocolate cafe around when i left champaign .
that seemed kind of sudden !
that was my favorite date place ever !
meh ) , but you left us too soon , moonstruck .
and your logo was cute .
loved those bub 's balls and happy hour euker games .
my favorite college bar and i did n't even go to college there .
most surfaces were wet .
everything is sticky honestly i would never go back to this bar .
i might just have the secretary of state bill you for my next one .
i used the bathroom and found there was no soap !
i elected not to order any food and left to go eat somewhere else .
it was always uber crowded on tuesdays and the music was always great !
wine night always meant a good time ( read : blacked-out drunkenness ) .
the themed parties were entertaining .
and there was absolutely enough room to dance at all times .
i just went back for a visit , and they redid the place .
seriously , i was impressed .
i probably would have given it a _ num _ .
hey , my 19th birthday was wine night .
we did n't see any .
ok , so i went here on a busier night .
they have , however , added more tables , which is a plus .
cover could be a bit high for a college bar .
might as well just let people sleep there .
3:37 pm - the cook just came out and punched me in the neck .
* turned out i knew him from high school .
apparently the barista went to high school with us too .
* the drink specials are pretty awesome , especially tues and thurs * the bartenders are cool , until a ton of people show up * nice crowd , though it can get packed this bar closed down in _ num _ for renovation and reopened in spring _ num _ .
but its clich done right .
there were several floors ; three to be exact from what i remember .
the thing that struck me were the floors .
about two hours inside the club , the floors got really slippery .
that was my bad , whoops .
one suggested clybourne .
no big lunch crowd made me wonder about the food and service .
well , both were great .
youngsters who ca n't handle their overpriced watered-down liquor _ num _ .
bottom line : seemed to be more upscale than other bars in the area .
; ) used to go their a lot because of the diversity of crowd .
of course , i was in grad school and not an undergrad .
i found the whole demographics off in this place .
oh man , how my friends and i loved that .
this location used to be a tiny little mom-n-pop grocery/convenience store .
they always had good music playing in it too .
i was amazed how much can fit in the store .
i bought a block my freshman year .
they even gave me a free rental on my birthday !
highly recommended .
my mom and i rented the whole 6-vhs ( i know ! )
we ran to the car and hightailed it over to that 's rentertainment .
if it were n't for that alone i would n't come back .
the employees were incredibly rude and were just standing in the ladies room .
joes was a really fun place to go ... when i was _ num _ .
they were young tho .
given the choice , i would choose other bars over joe 's .
my friends came here to get burgers so i waited outside with them .
the waitress , i know not her name , was incredibly rude and inattentive .
nobody tipped , and the food was lukewarm by the time she served us .
we had to hound her to even pay for the meals .
hardly anyone was in the bar .
we had been served by a girl with an illini scarf and was awesome .
another girl took over .
we ordered a diet with vodka , a coors light and _ num _ joes brew .
what we received was a coke and jack and _ num _ coors light .
service was horrible from the start .
we waited for an eternity just to get menus .
only _ num _ waters came out , before the best _ num _ .
all of our burgers came out at different times .
i got the california burger with onions rings .
only thing worth anything was their perfect onion rings .
i thought they 'd replace the deal with something else other than can bud-a-ritas ... if you really want to try this place come for half off burgers .
we came on a friday and got a pitcher of shandy for $ _ num _ .
also , i really liked the fries !
my niece enjoyed her `` gatorade '' which looked pretty good .
despite the frigid temps , the entire place was rockin ' !
food was pretty good , loved the mac and cheese as an upgrade .
however today 's visit had a special friend attend with us .
spotted a cockroach crawling on the wall .
i had the craziest adventure of my life at this establishment .
my first experience with joe 's was late on a weekend .
farren 's was my favorite burger until i tried the ragin ' cajun .
i was n't even drunk and this meal was like a religious experience .
finally got to stop in for lunch !
who knew this place had such great lunch !
dance floor is all right , music selection could be much better .
nice staff and reasonable prices , what more could a girl ask for ?
erin was very nice , and we chatted the whole time .
so , i went and was told i 'd be seeing debbie .
i did n't know what to expect , but she was great .
i liked my experience there so much that i 've gone back several times .
the stylist , aly , was incredibly nice and friendly .
she listened to what i wanted and then preformed an excellent haircut .
i was happy to find out that donna trained at aveda and came here .
i had the peanut butter cookie ( awesome ! )
i tried the double chocolate chip , chocolate chip walnut and chocolate chunk .
the chocolate chunk was by far the best of the three .
there was a lot of choco chunks and they were still a little gooey .
i was n't that big of a fan of the chocolate chip walnut .
the double choco cookie was fine .
overall : i would definitely come back .
my husband loved the buttercream sandwiches .
i lived here my freshman year , and it definitely was n't my favorite .
as an engineer , i had 8:00 calculus most mornings .
i lived at bromley hall my freshman and sophomore years .
but the killing blow came when they got rid of the mol burrito .
they replaced it with a rather disgusting bbq burrito that pales in comparison .
also pretty much identical to chipotle , which might be slightly better .
and my lettuce was rotten , wilted and brown .
my order was simple - all i wanted was burrito , without the meat .
and got there on time .
i waited _ num _ minutes and no one ever showed up to open the shop .
they did a great job both grooming/washing my dog and trimming her nails .
just went into this shop for the first time yesterday .
great selection of items and the owner seemed like a genuinely really nice guy .
i ended up buying an item and he was even willing to barter .
highly recommended .
i also had my sewing machine fixed up there .
i gave this place _ num _ chances before firing them as my dentist .
my dental insurance did n't cover such expenses .
convinced me i needed a cap , i did n't .
convinced me i had a new cavity every six months .
she had her room decorated and very homey looking .
i loved this place !
charlotte and dr. colin were great .
then , dr. colin came in .
i was flabbergasted .
it would greatly behoove dr. colin to learn an iota of compassion and understanding .
they also had n't sorted out things with my insurance company .
my first visit i went for normal x-ray and cleaning covered by insurance .
the hygienist spent her time and did an outstanding job .
i told her that i my insurance was to covere this visit _ num _ % .
got the filling then went to check out with `` d '' .
she of course proceeds to charge me as if that phone called never happened .
i came in thinking i had a cavity or two .
i left with the great news of `` you have _ num _ cavities ! ''
so i said yes .
got a second opinion at a reputable , family dentist office .
no braces needed .
going to have records transferred elsewhere .
going to have records transferred elsewhere .
she made this clear _ num _ times .
anyway she got manipulated into the fluoride treatment .
then they did the cleaning .
i said i am here for the free cleaning !
it felt very cozy and welcoming , which is a great feature .
the food was very good !
i ordered a vegetarian stir-fried noodle dish and was totally happy with my selection .
i ate it because i was hungry .
i got the spicy eggplant in black bean sauce and mixed vegetables with noodles .
there was hardly any flavor .
the other dish had no flavor really .
the crab rangoon were good though a little too cream cheesy .
it was reasonably priced .
like i said , i was hungry .
you were expecting gourmet dining ?
the kitchen had lost our order .
to apologize , the manager brought out a free appetizer and entree .
on top of that he waived the entire cost of the meal .
however , i enjoyed my first dining experience couple days ago .
rainbow garden had a nice oriental ambiance .
the lunch special was a very reasonable price ranging between $ 5 - $ _ num _ .
i ordered a jajangmyeon and tangsuyuk for takeout .
prices were comparable to what i would pay back home near chicago .
the portions were pretty decent as well .
taste-wise the jajangmyeon was good , but not as good as back home .
the tangsuyuk was nicely fried and cripsy .
i went here on a tuesday afternoon at about 5 pm .
it went smooth enough though , and my order came fast , within minutes .
i probably could have done better at home .
was packed like sardines tonight .
i liked it enough .
i got chicken eggplant last time i went and it was amazing .
food took no time to get to us .
i recently got this for delivery which was very quick .
we started with sechuan wontons which were tasty and inexpensive .
he also had beef lo mein that was pretty tasty .
i also appreciated that they only used white meat chicken .
the general 's chicken seemed to have poorer quality chicken then usual .
perhaps this was just an off night .
and complained about trivial things .
we went for a quick lunch .
hot and sour soup and crab rangoons were pretty good .
cons : we did n't enjoy the garlic chicken too much .
we actually brought it home thinking that we would possibly eat it later .
we ended up tossing it .
did n't compare at all to what we can get a home .
if all were of this quality , i would go for chinese more often .
that was extremely rude and i was quite offended by it .
i ordered the jajang myun , which is the black bean noodles .
it came with a loads of seafood , beef , and vegetables .
we also got the sweet fried beef , which was also very tasty .
i was very pleased with those dishes , especially my black bean noodles .
i had the spicy chicken with basil , which was very good .
i was a bit apprehensive about getting _ num _ per order .
many mentioned the portions were large here .
went with white coworkers for lunch a few times .
food was greasy as hell .
i ate it with my chopsticks .
i got the garlic battered shrimp with cashews which was good - 3.5 / 5 .
my boyfriend got the tofu stir fry with mushrooms and it was disappointing .
i would say a 2/5 .
i would be back for the walnut shrimp or the garlic shrimp .
the tofu stir fry was $ _ num _ .
i placed my order for carry out .
the woman taking my order over the phone was very friendly .
she gave me a _ num _ minute wait time .
it was ready when i got there .
the food was so delicious !
everyone was happy with all .
our favorite dish was the crab rangoon appetizer .
when this place opened it was more under-the-radar .
it became a bit generic .
i stopped going here last week because * the beer tastes watered-down and the food is ridiculously bland and over-priced .
i used to think it was a one-star .
lastly , i ordered the gazpacho .
it was bad .
it was really just pico de gallo with more cucumbers .
i hated this place .
i arrived and found a seat outside , so as to smoke .
i paid $ _ num _ for two bottles of pbr at this point .
we left after the bar tender insulted my friend .
and did i mention crowded ?
it used to be .
odd bathroom set up .
would go again ... mostly for convenience .
the questions were perfect for our group of _ num _ .
sat out side and had a cilantro , lime & chicken crisper .
overall had a pretty good taste .
great food , great drinks , great sound engineer , ( he even gave me a wireless mic ! )
but we went here for a friend 's birthday and i was thoroughly impressed .
the staff was welcoming , kind and understood exactly what we wanted .
my margarita tasted like orange juice ... no hint of a margarita : ( .
the nachos were just average mostly goopy .
the service also was quite friendly , attentive and spot on .
if based on patio and beverages alone ... well , would definitely rank higher .
i went to cowboy monkey on sunday for trivia night .
i also had the quesadilla , which was a tri-cheese quesadilla .
it tasted like a quesadilla you could make at home , nothing special .
i went to cowboy monkey with some friends for their sunday night trivia .
we left and went somewhere that appreciates our business .
bartender was super rude .
waitress could not tell us anything about the beers on tap .
menu listed regular beers on tap that were n't .
she said she was n't a beer drinker .
then told us every beer was an ipa .
after googling the names , i figured out she was n't correct .
we hung in there and i ordered a beer .
hubby gave up and ordered scotch .
then the chips and `` salsa '' arrived .
it was n't salsa ... it was watery pico de gallo .
we used to go when they had their home nearby on green st .
i noticed a lot of produce was gone , and shelves were semi-bare .
, but they sold us a whole bagful of rotten purple yams !
we got home and started preparing them before we figured it out .
this small market was a huge surprise to me .
i bought daikon radish here .
they were out of it at far east .
i would like to repurpose the little bottles and fit them with corks .
paul and i also walked out with a 20 lb bag of rice .
we were told it will be sticky rice .
i was able to find the green tea that i was craving here .
with some upgrades , this one could be a winner .
it was pretty cheap .
the rooms were updated and clean - comfy bed , down comforter .
parking kind of sucked .
so it constantly sounded like there was crazy wind outside .
i had a decent experience overall .
i went with this place for location .
the toiletries were surprisingly bath and body works .
this place was ok for champagne-urbana .
stayed here for my cousins wedding .
the bathroom was tiny and the dressing/grooming mirror was out in the main room .
there seemed to be a lot of exterior noise as well .
slept _ num _ comfortably .
i could n't hear any noise from other rooms or the hallway .
free wi-fi that was pretty fast , and no password was required .
lobby was clean and attractive .
i was worried when i read some of the old reviews .
our group had our own breakout room so we could take our food there .
there was a lot of staff at breakfast and they kept everything well stocked .
and they were very friendly .
i definitely would choose to stay here .
i never got dropped .
i could always sign on .
this was a first pick via the flying service here at local airport .
was convenient to find , about _ num _ miles from the airport .
i would stay again , likely .
well done .
found super gross spots on the sheet under the pillows .
when we checked out , we inadvertently left some clothes in the drawers .
some of these were new & never before worn .
when i packed up to leave i forgot the things in the drawer !
i called the hotel .
arrived at 6:30 pm .
rooms not ready , manager rude and did not offer any sort of concession .
stayed here multiple times .
granted it was homecoming weekend but this place was pretty filthy .
the common areas were really filthy .
rented a `` suite '' .
bathroom was _ num _ x _ num _ tops .
large room space just laid out terribly .
the free breakfast was the only saving grace .
it was tremendous !
i was in the market for a new pair of running shoes .
i happened to be in the mall .
to which ... i said , `` no .
i went in , knowing exactly what i wanted .
just come on by ... .
he did n't .
it was like i was invisible , y' all .
i walked over .
all their sales associate were walking around without doing anything useful for the customers .
i was waiting someone to help me with some pick-up stuff .
the associates saw me waiting but just walking towards the other way .
they just pretended they did n't see you .
the outer layers were dry .
when i was little , i loved when we got bread from great harvest .
i had always assumed they were a local business .
i would love to see some sprouted and gluten-free options .
i got their turkey sandwich , which was nothing special but still good .
the staff was friendly and really helpful too .
the flavor of the ham was really good and everything was fresh and crisp .
the bread was a little stiff but that did n't bother me .
i chose some cinnamon bread that was very good .
like their freshly baked goods .
bought a almond vanilla swirl .
it was a saturday night , when the bar is super crowded .
the greek one was a disaster .
it was supposed to have sausage , but i could n't taste any .
the vegetarian one , although being the better one , was kind of juicy .
but these ones , well , you heard me .
relaxed and laid back .
she had been to esquire before and said the burgers were good .
i had the chicken tender sandwich with fries , and it was fabulous .
everything a fried chicken finger sandwich could be .
i enjoyed sitting outside and watching the people walk by .
and she loved that they had fat tire on tap .
overall , i would definitely recommend this place .
i had the greatest experience at esquire .
our food was delicious , came hot , and was inexpensive .
it was a wonderful experience .
but it went to terrible after yesterday .
i went with two friends to have some drinks and pizza .
she basically wanted to know why we would want such a thing .
she ignored us and stalked off , returning with our money shortly thereafter .
the dude listened to us and in short said , `` too bad !
the bartenders called the guy a cab and made sure he got home okay .
the beer selection was surprisingly good .
the food was pretty good as well .
i had a simple cheeseburger and fries .
and i almost forgot , free peanuts ! )
, got cheap drinks , and just had a relaxing low-key night .
welp , we found all of that , and some , at esquire .
oh , and did i mention they have free peanuts ?
did i mention the most reasonable drink prices around ?
i only went there once but i really liked it .
i got a burger which was pretty good and reasonably priced .
i sat outside and it was just a really comfortable place to be .
everyone there was friendly and just relaxing .
the draft beer selection was ok .
neither one was that great .
the staff was super friendly and great with the kids .
the price was also right .
every single visit to the esquire , i received unfriendly , uninviting service .
i tried the steak garden salad and the meat was cooked to perfection .
i would not put esquire on that list .
i was told the burgers were good .
the strips were nearly tasteless .
my wife had the wings .
these things had enough salt to turn lake michigan into a salt lake .
they were awful .
i would not go back at all .
came to this place to end the night after celebrating a friend 's birthday .
shared fries , fried potstickers , pizza and chicken tenders .
the food was decent .
either that or i was starving - probably the latter .
the server was a bit pushy and had an attitude .
after we ate , we played a few rounds of pool .
i was stunned and asked my friends what was going on .
from how she was acting you would 've thought someone had gotten killed .
turns out my friend forgot to pay for pool .
she was out her damn mind yelling at us like she was crazy !
the way this woman acted was completely rude and unprofessional .
wish i could give this place _ num _ stars .
i came here with my mom and sister to grab some food on sunday .
it seemed to be the only place open .
the salmon only cost $ _ num _ and it was a fairly big portion .
the servers were nice but the atmosphere was too load .
good food , great prices - nice relaxed atmosphere .
just got back from a great party at esquire .
the food was fantastic !
you know , an acceptable environment within which to get your drank on .
i grew up in this bar , much like jackie h 's review .
my parents originally met here .
though these are baked , not fried and battered like most .
the pizza was pretty decent - thin crust .
we ordered the hawaiian although we substituted bbq sauce for regular pizza tomato sauce .
i ordered the burger the first time and a hot dog the second .
got ta admit that the name of the place belies what 's actually inside .
my burger and fried mushroom meal came out to be $ _ num _ .
this was very tasty !
had it during lunch time when it 's not too busy .
came on a friday night and it was really packed .
came here after , .
, jessica was excellent bartender .
service was super fast .
salad was surprisingly fresh ( and only $ _ num _ ! )
pizza was great .
throwing peanuts on the ground was fun .
it looked dmn good !
so on saturday i ordered one -- - sausage cheese and mushrooms .
sorry i did ' t tip him ... but the female waitress had me shocked !
last night was in there for dinner .
the lady again asked `` what do you want ? ''
so , we settled on esquire .
i went with medium rare .
did you want a pitcher of pnls , because you can get it here !
the food was average , nothing like what the other reviews here say .
we visited due to the outstanding yelp reviews , but were extremely disappointed .
ten years into champaign and i never really visited until last year .
however , i was pleasantly surprised .
just for that , i upped my star to four .
this was always one of my favorite bars in downtown champaign .
yelp took it down , though i have no idea why .
that 's it , nuff said !
i got a magnificent large pizza for only $ _ num _ .
and it was huuuuge .
i had a mustard base sauce pizza that was awesome !
i loved it .
nowhere else could i go for this pizza .
had a fantastic late saturday evening here .
this allowed me to get a large smoked salmon pizza for $ _ num _ .
while it might not sound like a great combination , this pizza was fantastic .
drinks were n't expensive , and overall there was a good selection .
the service was ok , but the atmosphere and food were n't anything special .
we also had a long wait to get a table and food .
come here for some pizza before and after a night of drinking .
man was i surprised by the excellent food and great service !
we had to learn that the hard way .
my girlfriend enjoyed the thin crust pizza so that was good enough for me .
luckily we got seats at the bar .
we just had to wear our coats throughout dinner .
we said no and assumed she would bring us the check .
but did n't and we sat there for like _ num _ more minutes .
had to grab her attention and then ask for the check .
fun place with friends last night we thought we 'd try jupiter 's .
the pizza however was only okay .
the pizza was pretty good .
we moved to ca and can not find anything even close !
nuff said .
i was surprised that i had n't heard much about it before .
i tried the pesto margarita personal size pizza and i loved it .
the service was good , very unintrusive , which was nice .
i could even imagine studying here as a treat to myself .
i would have given jupiter 's _ num _ or _ num _ stars for the pizza .
if you want a drink or play pool , then it would get 5/5 .
went with kids so we are just checking out their arcade games .
came here after a wedding reception , in need of some grub .
it was fairly tasty .
she seemed annoyed i brought this up .
i bought and paid for one beer .
i get home and they had charged me _ num _ dollars .
would have been nice to know before they did it .
wise choice , it was perfection .
my family loved the atmosphere , design , food , and staff .
either way , it made the pizza just taste mediocre .
this was cardboard crust pizza .
the service was just okay ; our server was n't the most attentive .
the pizza was good , but could 've used more toppings .
overall , a little pricey but fun for the kids and grown ups .
jupiter 's was always a favorite when going out .
relaxed .
but was charged over $ _ num _ .
i was in town for an event and decided to grab a quick bite .
went here on a tues. night about 6:20 pm .
got a booth by the kitchen , very dark .
ordered a house salad w / no cucumbers & no croutons .
salad came w / a mountain of cheese .
menu did not say anything about cheese .
salad # _ num _ came out with no onions .
i specifically asked for onions .
trying to flag down my server was difficult .
i told her to take it off my bill .
pizza came , it was ok , but crust was tough .
they did good .
: d mariah took care of us and everything went smoothly .
the staff was also super friendly .
they lost my plates in the mail .
i finally contacted the state of illinois dmv and no paperwork has been submitted !
there was a little bit of a wait but no more than 10-15 minutes .
so i went to the cost cuttery by green and neil .
i had stephanie cut my hair .
she was friendly and gave me a pretty good hair cut quickly .
there was no wash or style but i saved myself about $ _ num _ .
i would go back for a cut again .
i loved this place from the moment i walked in .
stephanie was great , she took my information and promptly helped me .
not only all of that , but the haircut was great !
and with so many places i was n't sure where to go .
however it was such a disappointment .
my haircut was cut by a very young lady seems like apprentice .
apartment was tiny .
what happened ?
i had the _ num _ course tasting flight tonight at bacaro and it was incredible .
this place was a bit of a disappointment for me .
i definitely would n't go back here , but it was an interesting experience .
the first course , a shrimp bruschetta , was amazing .
it had a wonderful spicy and tangy flavor accented with some unexpected mint leaves .
unfortunately , the main course left much to be desired .
my companion 's lobster ravioli was well executed , but bland .
however , my cavatappi was nearly inexcusable .
dessert was an ice cream sandwich made with snickerdoodle cookies .
service was attentive , if a little pretentious .
but everything was overshadowed by the cavatappi .
i used to think it was _ num _ .
i ordered duck , which arrived totally well done ( so bizarre ) .
when i complained about it , nothing was done .
i was horrified .
my boyfriend and i decided to share a bunch of dishes .
that was some seriously great food !
had a really awesome special pinot grigio with literally peaches floating around !
it was so great .
expensive food but quite delicious and well presented .
the waitress made a great wine selection to go with our food .
at bacaro we got blown away at how awesome the two desserts were .
waitress was fast , and courteous .
my second dessert trip was also perfect .
they were both perfection .
i was so incredibly disappointed .
when questioned , we were told `` they asked for doubles . ''
what arrived at the table was a glorified ham and cheese sandwich .
as this would indicate , the menu changes frequently .
third friend had a seafood risotto that was the best of the three entrees .
waiter was nice but new i would guess because he seemed nervous .
she was also miss champaign county at the county fair a few years ago .
the food came in very small portions , but it tasted good .
the $ _ num _ pork belly appetizer was smaller than a golf ball .
the waitress was wonderful .
then we had three entrees , all were very good .
my only complaint was the waitress was a complete moron .
i had the veal and it was wonderful .
the menu was confusing , but overall the food was excellent .
our waitress was attentive , but a complete airhead .
the food was a little salty but very original and tasty .
service was a tad slow and not timed well but it was very busy .
it was done tastefully , and with some thought .
i waited for _ num _ minutes even though i had a reservation .
my boyfriend took me to bacaro for an amazingly romantic dinner date .
i was impressed with the atmosphere , the knowledgable waitstaff , and flavorful .
i would definitely return .
the menu was very nice .
the service was excellent .
my companion suffered the same fate .
we ended up drinking beer because we could not find anything we liked .
my date secured us a reservation here for valentines day .
server was snooty , bar man was snooty .
crammed seating .
the atmosphere was pleasant and the ambient music was suitable for the occasion .
food was excellent .
_ num _ of us had a fantastic time at this restaurant last night .
the resounding favorite was the octopus appetizer which was tender and flavor - full .
the seared scallops with myers lemon were refreshing and light .
the food was expensive ; the food was good .
three people , three different dishes , and everybody liked theirs .
the malbec we drank with dinner was a nice random choice .
the bad : our waitress was new .
the manhattans were terrible .
i would totally recommend bacaro if you need `` fancy dinner out . ''
it was really very good .
i loved the goat cheese salad and my rich creamy risotto .
fried sweetbreads were luscious .
my boyfriend 's chicken with chicken liver was delicious .
i rather enjoyed bacaro .
it had a really nice atmosphere , quality food , and good wine .
the pairing was correct and the wine went well with our meals .
but first strike happened right off the bat with the hostess .
no one was at the two tables next to us .
it was awkward all evening being that close to two other tables .
no sugar offered and she was so busy we hated to even bother her .
finally at some point we managed to sneak in the ask .
but why did we have to ask .
so after hem hawing a moment she finally headed to the kitchen to ask .
fortunately , they were able to accept my request .
the dinner started off with an amuse bouche of a tiny square of frittata .
i noticed on the menu that it was $ _ num _ and thought hmm ... .
he was stil hungry after he ate it .
the food was interesting , nicely presented , perfectly portioned and delicious !
we finally made time last night .
great atmosphere , dimly lit , very nice .
the octopus was the best i 've ever had .
the gnocchi was incredibly savory .
my husband tried the steak and i had the lamb special .
both were fantastic .
wine was good , not great .
would be nice to have some descriptions in the wine menu .
we did not eat dessert as we were stuffed .
visit _ num _ : had halibut with some kind of crust in a mint-gazpacho .
the fish was fresh and of excellent quality .
the gazpacho was also greasy and was not pleasantly minty .
fantastic ingredients but badly executed prep .
three courses all of which were delicious .
my main was halibut again , with some kind of vanilla saffron sauce .
the fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce was complex and homey .
the spaetzle were delicious !
i could eat that spaetzle every day .
the pork however was dry .
it was that dry .
if the food was consistent , bacaro would be an easy 5-stars .
went here for 1-year anniversary .
overpriced .
i went there twice last year .
i only gave it five stars because i can only give five stars .
it was a pleasure to have this restaurant available in the middle of illinois .
the scallops and pork were delicious .
it was fantastic .
the other person had the grilled salmon and it was equally good .
i felt decidedly underwhelmed and overcharged .
this place blew my mind it was so good .
i paired it with the wines too .
the wine list was definitely impressive .
the wines paired perfectly with each dish , i was so happy .
about the food ... i was just so impressed .
the rib eye for the main course was flavorful and again very tender .
the cheese course was fun .
and i loved thin very rich slice of chocolate dessert .
to be honest , i was simply amazed at the quality of these dishes .
i thought it was great .
we did n't order entrees just appetizers and salad .
they still sent out an amuse-bouche and sliced baguette with olive oil .
food was excellent and the atmosphere was very warm and pleasant .
portions were reasonable , but not huge .
i ordered duck and my boyfriend ordered the beef fillet .
they were both very good .
we also shared an appetizer , octopus salad .
service was awesome .
i made reservation in the morning .
and it was full at dinner time .
walked across the street to esquire and had dinner again .
we ordered the tasting menu and were not disappointed .
seven courses and all were expertly prepared .
staff was friendly and courteous ... .
i liked the experience at bacaro .
the steak was excellent .
food was excellent but did not have a great experience with waitress .
table of _ num _ , we all ordered tasting menu with wine pairings .
water was slow to be refilled .
the pinot noir was delightful and the cab sauv was decent as well .
for dinner , the risotto with rabbit was tasty .
dessert was a red velvet ice cream cake .
it was okay .
i had a lovely anniversary dinner here a few years back .
food was excellent but did not have a great experience with waitress .
table of _ num _ , we all ordered tasting menu with wine pairings .
water was slow to be refilled .
based strictly on the menu i was really hoping for a great dinner .
however , i was really disappointed with the our dinner .
my wife had the chicken and i had the ribeye .
my steak was n't very tender or all that flavorful .
her chicken was cooked decently enough but again the flavor was really just average .
the atmosphere and the waiter we had were very nice .
that said , this could be a product of where i sat .
used yelp to find this place and was not disappointed .
very good food and service meant for a great time .
we had an absolutely great meal at bacaros !
we went all vegetarian but the mushrooms , beets , and prizetta were awesome !
wine list was very good .
food was excellent .
service was great .
atmosphere was great .
i wold recommend this to anyone .
i was very pleasantly surprised .
highly recommended .
we were forced to listen to a guest m.d .
it was a very unpleasant dinner .
the soup was also extremely salty .
would highly recommend !
food , wine , presentation and service were exceptional !
and both times the food and wine parings was amazing .
the look of excitement on my wife face was priceless .
like there could be a bad meal from this spot .
done shun a wonderful place to take a date .
over the weekend i took a date here for dinner .
we both had the filet .
it was wonderful !
cooked to perfection , and melted in our mouths .
not to mention , we washed it down with a great cabernet .
i would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys an upscale experience .
we had the pizzetta for an appetizer which has a great combination of flavors !
i also loved the risotto , it was amazing !
the service was excellent .
i came here with my friend when he was visiting from san francisco .
we had their market monday menu since it was monday .
all made fresh , nothing frozen .
i would like to see more variety .
we also had the peas and carrots .
this place would do well in chicago or any other `` foodie '' city .
been here many times before and so had certain expectations .
well tonight things went quite differently .
it was looking like a total disaster .
then rose ( asst mgr ) came to the rescue .
within a few minutes everything was made right .
rose was simply amazing !
well , sweet jesus it was awesome !
last night , we tried the monday market menu : november _ num _ _ num _ butternut squash cake crispy quinoa , sage , pecans pork terrine braised brussels sprouts , oyster mushrooms , pumpkin vinaigrette cauliflower tortelli brown butter , balsamic , hazelnuts , oregano , parmigiano reggiano smoked turkey breast white bean brioche stuffing , spinach , cranberry gastrique sweet potato creme brulee tonga island vanilla bean , caramelized sugar each dish was prepared and served with care .
our server , kate , was attentive and kind .
did n't knock my socks off .
we decided in the tasting menu and each got the wine pairing .
there were seven courses on the tasting menu , including a dessert .
the atmosphere was great .
i was surprised to find this gem in cu .
our dinner meeting was held at this location .
this cost _ num _ dollars and the portion size was very small .
once again the portion size was quite small as you see from my picture .
i ordered a very good glass of riesling .
they brought bread to our table with olive oil .
the bread was very fresh and the oil was high grade .
my husband ordered house made gnocchi that came with pork .
i ordered a ravioli stuffed with bacon and several fresh vegetables .
we did n't order dessert , as we are n't dessert people .
we ate there on a whim a while back .
we walked bye and the place was empty .
so we decided to give it a try rather than our initial option .
staff was very snooty to us because did n't have reservstions .
at first they said they were booked .
again , the place was completley empty .
two tables total seated eating .
after _ num _ people and much talking they sat us .
price was very high .
food was average .
service was extremely slow .
the place never got more than half full .
we went for a market monday tasting menu meal with wine pairings .
everything was fabulous from start to finish .
they served an outstanding meal .
i would definitely get the lamb porchetta again and the panna cotta for sure .
the food was incredibly good .
the servers and bartenders were knowledgeable and attentive .
we spent _ num _ hours eating our _ num _ course meal .
just drank some wine there .
the bartenders were very nice .
truffle fries were so fabulous !
we went for our first anniversary .
we opted for a la carte options .
the food was great .
everything was jam packed with flavor , perfectly cooked , and elegantly presented .
would definitely return for another ` date night ' or special occasion .
it was so thoughtful and sweet !
we each ordered the tasting menu and neither of us were disappointed .
everything we were served was amazing .
everything from the staff to the atmosphere was just simply wonderful .
came here with a friend 's parents ( who were paying ! )
and we loved it .
the service was great and the food was amazing .
i just personally could generally not afford to come here as a student .
it was a couple weeks ago since i 've been .
server was evan he was awesome , super knowledgable and cool personality .
we were there _ num _ hours .
it was awesome .
i had the best soup i 've ever tasted .
the food was very good but over priced for the market value .
over the experience was great lots of wine to choose from and pleasant atmosphere .
food and service were spot on .
menu was simple yet diverse .
the food , service , and atmosphere were excellent .
we had two pasta dishes off the menu .
the pasta was perfectly cooked and the flavors were excellent .
the starter was the celery soup , which was also excelent .
we paired it with a reasonably priced chianti wine .
i had a pretty good meal here .
to start , i ordered the warm lobster and fennel `` salad . ''
for my entree , i ordered the duck with polenta and fried mushrooms .
i have to say , this was a pretty excellent dish .
they were crispy and chewy and added great texture and flavor to the dish .
for dessert , we had the donuts and the chocolate truffles on the table .
however , i enjoyed bacaro and would return for a special occasion dinner .
food was amazing .
pricing and portions were more on par with chicago so that was interesting .
this place was top notch .
service was attentive and quick .
food was excellent and presented well .
i went on a date here and absolutely loved it !
i had the lamb once and that was a bit rough , not tender .
dessert menu was very standard .
i used to go [ almost ] every sunday for brunch .
i always found myself staring at the sculptural objects on the walls .
and the tables made with old doors .
did lunch in their new tapas bar today .
our waiter was great , in fact he added to my experience .
then shared a few tapas with my friend .
we had the pita triangles with hummus and the tuna salad sandwich .
the portions were acurately small .
flavor was good but again , nothing special .
i went here for valentine 's day and was slightly disappointed .
we were also seated by the window and the heating was poor .
i also tried the tapas bar recently , which was a slightly better experience .
the salmon skewers with cucumber were perfectly spiced and delectable .
the balsamic fruit with manchego on bread was good as well .
however , the lamb skewers ... they were like meatloaf on a stick .
unfortunately , most of us were underwhelmed with the food .
the mediocre food was made up for by the wonderful decor and overall experience .
i dearly loved this place when i lived in c-u .
they kickstarted a great trend .
downtown champaign would n't be what it is today without radio maria .
we sat across a huge purple bar .
the menu was much different than i remembered .
they offered tapas , which we did n't mind at all .
the best tapas we ordered was the vegetarian paella .
the margarita i ordered was spot on .
not to strong , not to watered down .
radio maria was the first restaurant downtown , and they did a fabulous job .
radio maria was one of the first restaurants in the current resurgence of downtown .
but eventually our food came , and he was very apologetic .
my favorites were the egg plant frittes and the seared scallops .
everything tasted fresh and light - just like breakfast should .
tonight , we finally had dinner at the infamous champaign culinary sensation .
we started off sharing the mezze plate .
pita was pizza dough-y , but buttery too ... strange , in my opinion .
also , i found the couscous bland .
best part was the hummus , which i was wishing they served more of .
for dinner i ordered the crabcakes , which were more like crabballs .
goat cheese potato pancakes were crisp , but lacked seasoning .
more if i had extra aioli .
beau ordered the adobo pork .
like the roughage on my plate , the honey left his chayote-cilantro salad be .
there , i said it .
when my eldest was a baby they had a beautiful vintage deathtrap highchair .
none of our drinks were refilled , and it took forever to order .
our server who i wish i remembered his name was fantastic !
that was _ num _ minutes later mind you .
i asked another guy walking by for a glass of water .
it took quite awhile for just the drinks to get delivered .
i took a sip of an incredibly fruity red wine .
sigh ... when the food arrived , it was alright .
it was okay food , just not as tasty as i 've had elsewhere .
the waitress asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu .
we went with the dark chocolate cake .
about _ num _ minutes later , we finally got the cake .
what took so long ?
maybe they had to bake the cake after we ordered it ... my friend said the cake tasted like deli meat to her .
it tasted out right burnt to me .
she was sincere , it was just annoying .
i was n't impressed with the food , and somewhat unhappy with the service .
the waitress was apologetic and nice enough about it .
we had n't been in the mood for tapas until we opened the menu .
the waitstaff and service was also very friendly , young and attentive .
but my wife and i had their valentine 's day menu this past weekend .
the food was great , but not for the outrageous cost .
awesome decor - heard that the owner customized everything himself .
when i got it and tasted it : ewwuck .
and tasted like syrup .
it would be different if there was something wrong with it .
but hey , at least i got a better deal at radio maria 's .
the staff used to describe it as a caribbean-polish fusion .
both were very good .
my boyfriend got the eggplant fries .
they were so-so .
a little too greasy and the sauce was too sweet for me .
there seemed to be one server for the entire place .
we sat there forever just waiting to order our food .
i ate every last morsel .
secondly , just about any option could be made vegetarian .
our lovely brunch was reasonably priced as well .
had the chance to visit this restaurant on a sunday night .
the masa boat was a little dry , but the flavors were well-balanced .
i went once for dinner .
the food was good , but unremarkable .
i had the korean hot pot .
it was good , but i was n't expecting it to be sweet .
the portion sizes were also tiny .
the only thing good was the goat cheese .
the biggest issue was that we were served the spanish tortilla omelet refrigerator cold .
the cheesecake was delicious .
i drank orange frescas , and did a lemon drop shot .
i would recommend rm for couples wanting a nice dinner out .
went for brunch and would definitely recommend it .
the beer bread was very tasty .
my meal here was phenomenal .
i got the masa boat surprise .
my wife got the fish tacos .
the masa boat was nothing short of amazing .
the dish also included black beans , yummy potatoes , and salsa .
all were delicious and well presented .
my warm chocolate cake dessert , however , tasted soggy and generally unpleasant .
our server tonight did a thoroughly wonderful job .
the lock was also broken .
holistically , though , i had a great dining experience here .
it was .
the spanish tortilla was burnt .
luckily , the harissa helped cover up the carcinogens .
staff were humans who treated customers as if they were a recognizable species .
meals were fun .
but thankfully this was not the case !
ate here on a visit from seattle and was very impressed .
the gnocchi was outstanding .
wish they had better hours though .
the parking lot attendant was rude .
could n't wait in my car to wait for my friend to arrive .
made me not want to go into the restaurant , so i did n't .
everything i 've had there was suuuuper delicious .
` nuff said .
my first disappointment was in the size of the menu .
i also ordered a small side salad .
the potatoes and chorizo came in an extremely small portions and where bland .
overall i left that place with $ _ num _ less and still hungry .
not worth the money and the food was a complete disappointment .
they were both fine .
fried eggplant with balsamic vinegar and honey ... what ?
my friend loved it .
i tried it .
lots of dishes with honey when i was there last .
came here for my birthday .
we ordered a couple glasses of pinot noir and were happy with their selection .
our appetizer , the broiled goat cheese , was amazing .
our scallops were perfectly cooked and seasoned .
i absolutely loved the mousse while my partner preferred the chocolate cake .
overall it was an amazing dinner .
we went for a brunch , and the food was amazing !
my wife had the french toast and something eggy .
the french toast was fabulous .
the cuban was served on a fresh baguette .
the meat was terrific , and so was the bread .
very highly recommended !
i came here for tapas after reading the reviews on yelp .
radio maria did not disappoint !
first off , i loved the atmosphere .
everything i ordered was great , but the potatoes were amazing !
they were crispy and had a delicious flavor because they were hickory smoked .
my husband and i recently ate at radio maria for dinner .
we 'd had sunday brunch and loved it at that time .
in all fairness , it started out wrong .
while he carried on an obvious flirtation/personal conversation with the other employee .
however , the kitchen was very clearly overextended on the graduation saturday .
as for the food , we started with the arancini and garlic shrimp skewers .
the arancini was satisfying though plain , and the shrimp skewers were well done .
as i mentioned , the entrees were good enough to warrant a return trip .
service was a little slow but great food and an interesting atmosphere .
i went with a friend and sat outside .
it was a beautiful night and our server was very personable and helpful .
we got three tapas and an entree and it was all great .
a bunch of people told us to try the plantains .
they were our least favorite .
they were n't bad ... just plain .
they were both excellent .
we had their gnocchi special which was absolutely delicious .
it was definitely worth the trip .
the servers were n't around every minute , but i really did n't mind .
last time i went there , i re-orgasmed over and over again .
anyway , a grad school fav ... on a friday afternoon , i was one of six sitting at the bar .
their drink menu was extensive , but pricey .
the server was personable and ready to provide recommendations though .
the brunch was very tasty and a good value .
the dinner , however , was nothing special .
the service was good .
i would suggest going here for brunch .
i had the brunch and enjoyed it thoroughly .
moral of the story : come here for brunch and not dinner .
lunch on one trip was nothing short of inedible .
dinner one night was nice but over priced .
what happened to this place ?
the food we ordered which was on a nearby table , was also covered .
the manager took no action in remedying the situation .
worse yet , the manager only refunded us the cost of one cheese plate .
i had the vegetarian masa boat on saturday , and it was absolutely delicious .
waiter was very friendly also forgot to mention the interior design of this place was very attractive and comfortable first time at radio maria .
had brunch on a busy sunday .
our waitress was pleasant , attentive , and fast .
i had the smoked pork torta and it was fantastic .
would like to go back again .
holy crap was it delicious !
the vibe was chill and trendy .
had brunch there on sunday with _ num _ people .
we loved it .
everything was spectacular .
only downfall - not enough of the potatoes which were incredible !
had the smoked trout omelette which was soooo good .
it did not .
gad - there was so much eye-candy , i had a blast !
from the outside it was n't very impressive .
once inside , we took a seat a the bar .
my first visit to champaign and our host took us here .
went here for brunch with my sisters .
the atmosphere was great !
went there for a late dinner .
ate off the tapas menu ... .
food was the best !
the scallops melted in your mouth !
wine was great ... service was great !
we tried the cheese plate which was outstanding .
i could have just eaten that and been happy .
the marinade was so vinegary , not a smooth flavor at all .
i would not order that again .
the paella was really really good .
the rice part was outstanding and the chicken and seafood were generous and tender .
it was a great meal with the family but very expensive .
ultimately i decided on three stars because the service is decent .
our server was pleasant but seemed bored and/or distracted .
came here one evening for tapas with friends .
i ordered the wild mushroom crostini , smoked pork tacos and sauteed calamari .
my favorite was the wild mushroom crostini .
the sauteed calamari was an interesting dish with a lot of flavor .
my wife and i returned to radio after not having been for several years .
the service was fantastic and the wine list was excellent .
the arancini were nicely done , if slightly overpowered by the breading .
similarly , the scallops were very well done , but were not diver scallops .
it totally overshadowed the crab .
the beignets were huge , which meant they were n't cooked through .
the best dish of the night was the tacos .
we came here for sunday brunch , and ordered _ num _ things .
marmalade added a nice kick to it though .
the deep fried house potatoes were delish .
we ordered a few tapas and an entree to share .
my friend decided to order them anyway .
for my last dinner experienced there , i had a tenderloin special .
a blue lit bar , and a spinning wheel of taps .
however , the service we got was unacceptable .
given the prices at the restaurant , we really expected better .
apparently , my 90 + year old grandparents did n't notice it either .
my grandpa also got meat that was not good quality .
it was very tough and he said it was inedible .
my friend and i went here for brunch .
everything was delicious !
i got the caprese omelet , and my friend got the lobster omelet .
the beer bread and potatoes that come with the omelet were so good !
we also tried the mexican coffee .
service was pretty slow , but we were okay with that this time .
i would love to try their lunch and dinner menu as well : ) great food .
the mussels were served in generous proportion .
food was decent - the radio maria torta was the best thing we tried .
desserts here were quite tasty .
the service was incredibly slow .
it took at least an hour to get our food .
we did tapas , so here ' s rundown .
likes fried artichoke hearts arancini ( favorite ! )
charcuterie so-so grilled hanger steak salmon raw and roasted apple salad the staff was friendly but not memorable .
some of the items i felt were well-priced ( $ 5-8 ) .
- the pork tacos were also delicious , and obviously slow cooked , very delicious .
the meh : overall : - would definitely return !
very good food , a little pricey but worth it for a nice dinner out food was good , not excellent .
ordered an omelette , eggs benedict , and egg sandwich .
everything was fresh and delicious , large portions .
beer bread was excellent , as were the mango mimosas !
would absolutely go back one of the best restaurants in town .
since i like trying different things , we decided to share _ num _ small plates .
mussels : really complex flavorful broth with well cooked and meaty mussels .
the toast they came with was top notch , also .
i loved these .
brunch was delicious !
i enjoyed the scrambler - all components were cooked perfectly .
loved the beer bread .
others in the party recommended the omelets as well .
generous portions , reasonably priced and fun atmosphere .
_ num _ of our _ num _ diners ordered it - all had spotless plates .
as a party venue , radio maria was really great .
we had a limited menu with four choices and we all pre-ordered our meals .
i ca n't say as much for the meal - i had smoked ribs .
they were pretty tough , but did have a good taste .
we started off ordering a tapas as our appetizer ... the apple salad .
it was very disappointing .
for pur entrees we ordered the scallops and duck meatloaf .
the duck was unknowingly served with the same exact jam .
we went there a few times .
the service was fine , the atmosphere was okay .
the food was awful .
everything contained way too much garlic .
you could smell and taste the garlic in everything .
went for sunday brunch .
shared some scones , got the `` special '' omelette with chorizo and vegetables .
pros : - the scones rocked .
- the house potatoes were perfect -- crispy and flavorful .
- my omelette was far too salty .
visited this restaurant for the first time with my girlfriend due to friend recommendation .
their coffee was not their highlight .
they offered two specials that day : an omelette and a stuffed chili pepper .
we listened to our friendly waiter 's recommendation and ordered one of each .
their baked potatoes that accompanied the core of the meals were phenomenal !
definitely would return to this place next time i am in town .
made the mistake of coming here for brunch homecoming weekend .
the service was incredibly slow .
took over an hour to get two breakfast dishes .
after the wait i was expecting greatness but this restaurant did not deliver .
eggs were over salted and the presentation was not appealing .
food was creative but a bit off the mark : 4/5 .
service was super slow and less than stellar : 2/5 time easily killed by a walk around downtown .
a nice touch , i thought .
so cue another wait ... food : rated from best to worst : what did not work : the goat cheese .
the slice of tomato/avocado combination did n't do anything for me .
but i would n't let that deter you .
pricey for being on a college student budget but delicious nonetheless it was stiff and hard to chew .
we ended up canceling the order .
only had a couple tapas here one time , but they were good .
brunch was awesome though .
fried banana ... french toast !
we almost ordered all the sides !
it was fabulous !
it tasted so good that i finished it all !
had group of _ num _ and all had terrific meals .
good mix of fixed menu , tapas and entrees represented ... all were excellent .
this place was out of this world with the creativeness of the appetizers .
we visited on a monday at around 5:30 .
the place was nearly empty , which was quite pleasant .
we were not disappointed ; the selection was quite nice .
we got the arancini and the torta maria .
the result was a bit too sweet for a dinner entree .
for dessert we got the bread pudding .
it was a solid if unexciting example of the form .
i had a great experience .
the food and drinks were great .
the ambience was great .
the waitress was very attentive to the party .
sat at the bar with a friend and the bar tender was awesome !
the ambiance was great because it was dark with cool lighting .
it was open late which worked because it 's a quiet town .
today we went and well ... where should i start ?
our waiter was completely aloof .
my steak and poached eggs were not hot when delivered to my table .
we were in before dinner norm hours .
salsa was tasty , pork bland .
i had a boss who was obsessed with this place .
service was excellent .
amazing food , i would recommend the pesto omelette !
also had the on their brunch menu .
the former , beautifully prepared .
but everything else on that plate , including the cornbread slice were lovely .
got the vegetarian paella and fried chickpeas .
neither were as flavorful as i would have expected .
would get the paella again , not the chickpeas .
i had the guava juice , churros , and smoked pork posole .
it hit the spot .
the goat cheese in the dish was delicious !
unfortunately , the service was still very slow after we were seated .
no one came to take our order until we flagged down a waiter ourselves .
food and atmosphere was excellent .
food was good but chorizo lacked flavor and heat in my special omelette .
bloody mary served in a wine glass ?
came in on a sunday with my brother and his wife and young son .
restaurant was very frendly and understanding of nephew wanting to walk around .
however , after being seated , the wait for service was pretty bad .
i did n't feel like messing with that and elected against it .
sadly , i had to remind the waiter _ num _ minutes later about my drink .
eventually that food came out .
the food was good .
the migas were crispy because of the cooked in tortilla strips .
it was a good amount of food and very tasty .
all the waiters/waitresses and hosts were extremely friendly and conversational .
kelly , our server , was quick , patient and polite .
i had the lobster omelette and my daughter had the lobster eggs benedict .
came here for tapas with my mom and brother on a sunday night .
we ordered _ num _ tapas to split between us .
the service was slow and a bit ... ditsy ... our artisanal cheeses were served with tiny hard pieces of pita bread , weird .
back to the cold pita that was served ... when she brought the pita back , it had been deep fried .
still not sure why this was n't served in the first place ... in summary : service : terrible food : pretty good , despite the fee makes that chef made atmosphere : very nice !
would repeat .
had brunch here and was recommended lobster eggs benedict .
i also tried their caprese omelet and it was too garlicky .
i would n't go there for their brunch .
i came here for brunch on a sunday morning .
the wait was n't too bad for two people close to noon .
decor - great nice atmosphere large bar with lots of choices end point : really really disappointing bloody mary had dinner here a few times .
would definitely recommend this place .
i felt like i was back home in chicago and not a college town .
this restaurant was just add good as the better places at home .
the dishes were original and delicious with fresh ingredients and flavor .
i went for brunch and got the migas dish .
it was very flavorful .
i really liked the table and overall interior decorations - very old-timey and vintage .
i would definitely come again !
i did n't know sunday was brunch only menu bad : service was untimely a gem in champaign !
just got up and walked out on mother 's day .
the food was amazing we had pork tacos !
there was a guy in the corner which started putting on some enticing music !
our bartender was on top of it !
the falafel ended up a little dry and the little leave wraps were sour .
not your typical dried out american falafal .
so why did i give it so many stars ?
the food was actually pretty good and i , at least , left satisfied .
pros : shawarma sandwich was decent .
kefta kabob meat was not bad ( ordered kefta kabob plate ) .
i tried the chicken shawrma sandwich .
it was good !
the flavors were very authentic , not too salty or spicy .
i would n't get it again .
it was not bland and definitely the highlight of my meal .
overall , i was disappointed having spent almost $ .
this place was way worse than what i expected .
no silverware or glassware whatsoever ; everything was disposable .
we ended up paying $ _ num _ for _ num _ people without any drinks .
honestly , my expectations could n't have been faltered this much .
overpriced for a small portion and bland .
freshness of food and the guy 's dedication to serve quality food impressed me .
the food was incredibly good , i highly recommend the chicken kabob sandwhich .
he made my food to-order , so it took about _ num _ mins .
jerusalem was my favorite place to eat the _ num _ years i was there .
today brought me to jerusalem middle eastern cuisine .
i waited about _ num _ minutes and done , done ; my food was ready .
the beef was very tasty and i loved the sauce .
my criteria for finding a hotel was rather short : cheap .
the room was spacious , and surprisingly quiet .
that made for a pleasant morning of tailgating in late october .
the smell was so bad that it seeped into our clothing .
there was also a cigarette burn in my blanket .
the manager just charged me for one day , but it was horrible !
low price was the main attraction .
manager was sarcastic , toward any complaints .
moved to la quinta next morning .
roadtrip from mn to cincinnati and this was our overnight .
it was clean although the room had a musty/stale smell and damp carpet .
it served it 's purporse for a place to crash .
there was no refrigerator , microwave , or breakfast .
they did have coffee in the lobby and some nice hazelnut creamer .
there was even a bug smashed and stuck on the wall .
we requested one of the newly renovated room and bottom floor .
the staff was real friendly .
overall , the hotel was great for my needs .
- clean interior ( recently new renovated room ) - clean bedding - great wi-fi - friendly staff cons : - noise from freeway super nice staff and clean basic renovated rooms .
we were traveling with a small trailer and were concerned about safe parking .
my wife and i stayed here after booking it on expedia .
we got the room for a discounted price and expected cheap quality .
the room looked amazing !
they removed their carpet and placed laminated floors so the floor was very clean .
the bed by far though was the best part .
it was a king size with soft and clean feeling sheets .
the mattress was very comfortable and the a/c worked like a dream .
i would definitely stay here again .
the place was affordable and the staff was really nice .
the laminate floors in the rooms were a brilliant idea .
i would definitely stay here again .
room was clean .
no problems , would stay again .
she mumbled us a warning about the pentagon and planes flying over the motel .
great room , recently renovated nicely , new `` hardwood '' floor -- clean !
dirty room , rude staff , overpriced .
also , garbage was overflowing in the breakfast area .
tv was old - not a flat screen .
room was hot .
worst decision you could make !
overall not bad for price paid .
both beds were super comfy and had lots of pillows and towels .
i slept really great both nights .
besides a little air freshening , it would be worth the $ 69/night .
great stay , staff was extremely friendly and helpful .
breakfast had a large selection and was very good .
my mom and i stayed here for _ num _ nights .
if i could rate this as a negative _ num _ star i would .
the towels were grungy and the toilet barely flushed .
we even had bare wires above our bed as no fixture had been installed .
the reviews on their website did not adequately represent this shit hole !
we stayed only one night here .
we would not visit here again .
i checked in , walked down to my room , and let myself in .
this was an improvement .
on the other hand , it had n't been cleaned from the last occupant .
the elevator was broken , and the tub and toilet were plugged .
did n't dare even try the free breakfast .
also technician accidentally dropped a bunch of chemicals in our yard in a pile .
i called and they claimed i had signed up for their total program .
i appreciated the warm cookies , friendly staff , and comfortable bed .
i would definitely stay here again .
had a romantic experience here in the hottub suite with my husband .
alexander 's was the place to go when you want to celebrate anything .
i would recommend this place .
tasty beef you cook yourself at a large open vented indoor grill .
ive always enjoyed coming here .
its always been decent .
but if it wasnt , i would only have myself to complain to ... i mean , i cooked the damn thing !
the salad bar was very poor .
very limited selection , and the food looked old and wilted .
still , our waitress was never around .
it was mostly bar goers and people sitting around for drinks .
food was n't bad , but it was very under-portioned and ridiculously over priced .
i would call it a man cave .
my wife would not like it !
but i did .
never had a problem with parking .
we were sadly very disappointed .
i ordered my steak medium rare and got it well done .
the steak itself was nothing special and for a fillet it was pretty fatty .
maybe if no upcharge kind of cool but come on .
three times i have eaten here never been dying to go back .
while i cooked my steak i enjoyed the salad bar .
fries were thin in one direction and broad in another .
we had a mixture of filets , ribeyes and sirloins .
the cuts were really good , not outstanding .
beets , bacon and eggs at the salad bar was a huge plus .
skillet cookie was top notch .
the manhattan was terrible .
went here for dinner .
we even had to ask for our check !
the food was awful .
the steaks had no flavor and were chewy .
we had ours cooked .
i would not recommend .
there were _ num _ in our party .
we did n't stay .
it was an ok experience .
was it the best food i have ever had ?
the floor was sticky and the table also was sticky .
the disappointing aspect was that the steaks were so bland .
the baked potato was actually really good yet the salad bar was nothing special .
the place seemed okay but was dirty and the lighting was terrible imho .
our waitress was nice and friendly and the service was good from that aspect .
probably would n't go back .
we had reservations and were seated quickly .
we waited another hour for our food .
7:15 arrival , nearly _ num _ when we got our food .
food was good .
i should have asked the barkeep for some bourbon but lesson learned .
the steak was really tasty regardless the spices or lack there of .
the porter went really well with the skillet cookie we got for desert .
little more pricey then i thought at first .
but would come back .
went back again on tuesday evening .
when my food came to table .
steak was under cook .
never said any word .
the decor made me think it would be much more affordable than it was .
i ordered the shrimp , which came in a huge portion .
i ate 1/2 of the serving and left the rest .
they were gummy and flavorless .
the salad bar was unremarkable , but not bad .
i thought the steaks are overpriced .
i enjoyed cooking my own steak .
a little $ $ $ but it was frantic cut of meet .
we found this place via yelp and were very pleased .
the ribeye i had needed some seasoning cooked to order med but somewhat bland .
other than the two negatives i had a great experience !
i made a reservation for 6 pm .
we all could 've been eating and done by now .
it was just super chaotic and unprofessional .
no you did n't .
i was so livid .
i had not been here for several years .
my meal was $ _ num _ for a fillet they cook .
the meat was fine the salad bar was empty there had been _ num _ buses .
the place was filthy .
the staff was beyond keeping up .
my bread was burnt my broccoli was cold and like eating a bush .
it took an hour to get our meal .
the waitress was absent .
the popcorn was burnt ... yikes !
had new carpet and wood floors put in my house .
the sales rep was very helpful .
i appreciated that .
when i did commit , she scheduled the installation promptly .
the installers were professional and personable .
she was always available throughout the entire process and afterwards .
i would not hesitate to recommend this business to anyone looking into new flooring .
pros : some good yellow ticket sales , variety of goods cons : no name brand clothes hidden deals : check your receipt for a _ num _ % off coupon after survey on one item i still shop here when i come to town to visit family .
_ num _ % off all clearances made amazing deals !
my husband found so many things as well as my sister .
they could so without a few rude employees .
it was .
even the lighting was just nice .
the store was very clean and well stocked .
because that was the thing that was always going to happen .
had to get a lighter last night .
did you know you get carded for lighters these days ?
the girl who cashed me out was not the same one as before .
it all made sense after the first time i went .
my custard was a little too soft and not creamy at all .
i would rather have culvers .
and it was admittedly delicious .
shit never went down like that in california .
indoor seating would be nice on a hot summer day .
cash only brought here by my fiance , a townie .
overpriced and bland .
they all tasted like regular eggy custard .
if i closed my eyes i would n't be able to tell them apart .
this was my first time visiting while down seeing my son at college .
i definitely would like to try their pies next time also .
i brought my new york friends to wait in the lines .
prior to this i was a huge fan of dairy queen .
come here for the lemon custard .
i was lucky in college .
i had friends with cars or i had a car to drive to jarlings .
i would go every day .
i never ordered anything i did n't like .
i highly recommend the strawberry cheesecake with strawberry custard snowstorm boy was i in for a treat .
the portion for was quite large for a small cup too .
we were in champaign for a wedding and stopped here .
had a couple snowstorms .
both were excellent .
they guy that took our order clearly had no clue what he was doing .
even then it took forever for our order to be made .
when they finally got the order up to the window it was already melting .
the snowstorm was smooth and had a rich peanut butter flavor to it .
on the other hand , i ended up literally drinking it .
i was n't impressed .
i recently also visited their danville location .
i got a single scoop of chocolate .
but it was chocolate done right .
loved this place as a kid .
i went _ num _ out of the _ num _ days i was in town visiting .
needless to say , i polished off both cups of custard each time .
i also tried a small vanilla sundae with their signature cold fudge - wow .
also got ta love the fact that they have a drive-thru !
just went to jarling 's after lunch at yellowfin .
i tried the limited edition cherries jubilee with cold fudge topping .
husband 's chocolate custard with almonds on top was a much better choice .
we did n't wait in line and the service was fine .
very crowded most of the time .
recommed the georgia peach .
i started a new job and was asked if i wanted something from jarlkings .
i ordered the special for simplistic sakes .
i surely could not pick one thing out of all the choices they have .
hands down answer was custard cup cold fudge .
i liked that it tasted like real natural chocolate .
we waited in a line of ~ 15 people for _ num _ minutes .
i timed the group in front of us ( _ num _ orders ) .
... a little dirt never killed anyone though , right ?
pointers : one dip = one ` scoop , ' two dips = two ` scoops ' snowstorms are comparable to mcflurries they 're seasonal ( closed during the winter ) & min of $ _ num _ for credit cards it 's a mom & pop ice cream place .
the milkshake was amazing !
` nuff said .
of the ones i tried , found peach and peppermint to be super yummy !
what was i thinking ?
anyways , i decided to go with the tortoise snowstorm .
it was quickly corrected to a tortoise snow storm .
i also ordered a teddy cup of the cake batter ice cream .
a dip would have been _ num _ , but the t cup was _ num _ .
i was a bit confused by my snowstorm , to be honest .
it said it was vanilla custard , although it came out looking like chocolate .
for my snowstorm , it was a different color , so i was confused .
i had a bit of his , and it was much better than mine .
the cake batter custard was nothing special , to be honest .
while eating , _ num _ wonderlake fire dept trucks pulled on both sides of us .
luckily it was n't too hot and sunny so it was n't crowded .
we just discovered they sell frozen custard cookie sandwiches which are also yummy .
lemon custard really hit the spot for me .
the place definitely had revisit values with their seasonal surprise flavor of the week .
i went with a mint chocolate chip snowstorm and it was the perfect treat .
if you want your frozen custard to stay frozen , come in february .
we had _ num _ cups of custard with sauce and _ num _ waffle cne .
good stuff , service seemed a bit slow ... .
people who had friends , had them cut in line .
reasonably priced , great tasting custard and sundaes .
pro : inexpensive ice cream `` custard '' , fast service hidden gem : snowstorm card , for every _ num _ you buy you get one free stopped at this local favorite while in the c-u area last week .
this left both him and dad with melted custard when they returned .
i personally had a banana split and it was absolutely amazing .
i got the peanut butter cup junior snowstorm custard cup and it was amazing !
the custard seemed to melt relatively fast though .
every time i ordered big one .
the owners could n't care less that there far better ways to do things .
the time would be cut b _ num _ % .
made fresh daily .
first time there over the weekend and i ordered a berry delightful snowstorm .
tried a bite of the cold fudge and wow .
perfect place for an evening snack delicious custard prepared in a huge variety of ways .
who knew that cold fudge would be better than the classic hot fudge ?
i spent nearly all of that decade at uni here .
and i just graduated an offspring as well .
heck , i used to walk here from far .
an apparent local institution and tom hanks recommended .
i had a kid sized strawberry with cold fudge and peanuts on top .
that hit the spot !
but it was good !
have only been here once , had the mint cookie snowstorm !
the snowstorm i had was very good .
the atmosphere was very nostalgic of an old ice cream parlor .
the lines were so long many had to wait outside .
waited over an hour on a sunday night around 8 pm .
if it were anywhere else , it would n't be so popular .
today i took my boyfriend to jarling 's because he 'd never been .
it took about _ num _ minutes in line before we got to order .
my boyfriend had a brownie snowstorm .
i ordered a fruit cup snow storm , because fruits are healthy .
it had strawberries and banana , could n't taste any other fruit .
by the time , i took picture it had melted .
but still , tasted gooooood .
ended up leaving out of frustration .
i ended up coming here take lunch out .
the chicken itself was prepared well with oil that was fresh .
the service here was also friendly and i had no issues pros : cheap lunchtime meal combos cons : not healthy hidden deals : check out the different meal deals available love this station .
we did not have a good experience there .
i ended up going to arby 's & got served right away .
first , i was in a large group .
the fries had a stale chemical taste .
the root beer float was abysmal .
after finishing my fries , i noticed a small bug walking across the wrapper .
amazingly , worse than i expected .
my food was fine , but the way it was handled was alarming .
my last experience here was my worst .
waited in the drive thru for _ num _ minutes as the only car .
if it were only me , i would have laughed and drove away .
that was it .
i used the drive-thru .
the employee that took my order , jasmine , was patient and friendly .
the biscuit and two piece combo was delicious .
pulled up to the window and the order was messed up .
instead of two meals they only had one .
i gave my order again two more times , each time slowly .
and you forgot the lettuce and the tomatoes are tasteless .
we had to walk out without our food .
angela was very diligent in adding the right colors so it matched perfectly !
very poor customer service here , especially displayed by store manager angela .
made exactly as i asked for .
was d'moes .
these guys gladly delivered to me , all the way down there !
well , the driver and my door man both called _ num _ times .
maybe he had a slice with us ?
it was pretty darn good .
the pizza was n't horrible , but the deal was awful .
way too greasy , and it was definitely stale , old grease .
ended up throwing half the pizza out because it just tasted so bad .
cheese only was edible , but anything we had with toppings was bad .
but tonight i got something different .
i got a hot sub , bacon and ranch sub .
it he food was so hot that u could n't even touch it .
it was so good ; - ) extremely satisfied with the service and food .
one would think that all domino 's are created equally ... .
not a single smile or hello when we walked in the door .
we felt like we were bothering them .
short and sweet ... received the pizza i ordered correctly , fast and friendly .
the manager hung up on me when i was trying to report an issue .
u could tell the guy who answered the phone was pissed off .
we called in a cheese pizza .
the manager was taking the phone calls and hung up on us multiple times !
would n't give us our total for delivery .
spoke to our awesome delivery driver who said everyone complains about this manager !
duh the pizza was great but this manager should n't work with the public .
filling our order this evening , failed miserably .
when i received my ready to pick up prompt , i drove over .
only pizza was ready .
i waited for wings .
i opened the pizza and it was also incorrect .
kj provided great customer service , so i was not as upset anymore .
i arrived home and the pizza was still wrong .
needless to say our dinner was ruined .
and the pizza was yummy !
it was chicken enchiladas yesterday .
it was great and huge .
i could not finish it .
th fish was over cooked .
found this place on yelp .
i was at a conference at the dept .
of ed .
and saw it was across the street .
saw this on yelp and gave it a try .
the chicken alfredo was a step above fazoli 's quality . )
they helped a friend in a time of great stress .
i used this garage on a saturday .
the parking was free that saturday morning .
i was able to find a park right next to the elevator .
i would use this agaon if i cant find street parking .
we were on level _ num _ .
lots of angry people were getting out of their cars to investigate .
run from this company !
i played here once and thought this spot was pretty cool .
the music was average , some latin pop/dance stuff .
again , sorry but it was the truth .
had a couple of drinks and left .
did n't even go hang around the under _ num _ section downstairs .
just kidding , i would never do that .
we had a blast here !
drank and danced after a suns game for about _ num _ hours .
even with our buzz , this place was a bust !
my female best friend and i were in town for the night , road-tripping .
i 'll skip some details here , and make a long story short : i bit my tongue .
saturday night they had like _ num _ dollar amfs .
and they had _ num _ dollar beers .
seemed like a decent place .
so we left .
the staff was so rude !
1st door guy said we could come in for free anytime fri night .
we came back about _ num _ min later .
the place was ghetto and empty .
i had a good time here .
been here over a dozen times , had some good and some bad .
from foam parties to all dressed in white events !
down stairs looked very empty .
upstairs ... oh dear ... it was packed .
a lot of randoms were just sitting and stole some beer from another table .
expired and bad .
replaced with miller high life .
it tasted like horrible meat and was so over-seasoned .
the staff was horrible .
i would never go back to this place again .
do not come here !
there was no cover for ladies but it was $ _ num _ for guys .
oh and we came on a saturday night around 11:30 for context .
i would give zero stars if it were an option .
if i could give this place zero stars , i would .
if i did that , i would be living in the alleyway behind tranz .
came here twice on ` goth ' night .
both times the place was dead .
still , the dj played great music and the decor is gorgeous .
what sold me completely ?
the dj played a reeeally good mix of music .
we 'd been there the first week of oct '09 . ]
as we left , we noticed club downtown next door was * still * poppin ' .
__________________________ smoothest `` i got hit on '' moment ever .
ok , so i got my emo/goth rant out of the way .
i went on a friday night ( 10/14/2011 ) .
there was no cover all night for guys and girls .
the dj played hip-hop , top _ num _ , good stuff !
mgt seemed inviting and friendly .
enjoyed ourselves because we were so many .
but another line was crossed last night .
two words : overpriced and understaffed .
overall it was cool .
i would highly recommend roger spencer for any of your commercial real estate needs .
he was worth every penny we spent and more !
i would definitely recommend them to anyone who needs a repair .
i took my truck in for a basic oil change .
the clerk was very nice and helpful .
and these guys totally failed .
oh , and the inspection we used a groupon for ?
i spent over $ _ num _ on my car at this place since july .
i too had the groupon .
i brought my car in and they checked over the whole car !
my car , unfortunately , had other plans .
we walked in and were helped right away .
my brand new battery was dead .
it had been completely drained !
not more than _ num _ minutes later , they had finished !
i was also pretty annoyed by the `` transfer '' of my trusted contact .
so , i started my search for a better option .
i went ahead and purchased the groupon after checking out the business on garagefly.com .
my 30k mile versa had developed an idling problem .
they did a diagnostic and the problem was a misfire on cylinder _ num _ .
as it turned out nissan had to replace my engine .
: ) matt and tim were great .
tim got it all arranged for me and explained everything as he always does .
many shops would just take the opportunity to do the service and charge you .
it had that tell-tale burning smell which was making me nervous .
virginia auto service changed my oil and cleaned up my engine .
did my oil change run a bit more than some $ _ num _ special ?
yes , but it was so worth it !
the price was fair and the service was done quickly .
i took my truck to get an oil change and inspection .
robert was super friendly and knowledgeable .
they did a great job and even picked me up from work .
pascal reassured me of their commitment to top end auto repair and excellence .
: ) definitely recommended !
i always passed by this place on my way to work .
recommended .
saved me a few hundred dollars .
and when a part could not be located in time provided a loaner car .
i took my car to virginia auto service for a very specific issue .
they called me with a totally different problem the cost to fix was outrageous .
i repeated what i needed and they told me no , no , no .
i lodged a complaint with the owner and requested a refund .
he laughed and said he would only communicate in writing with me .
* updated * original review : `` my car died on a sunday .
robert called me early in the morning and he was initially very friendly .
his quote was $ _ num _ .
i called back and asked if $ _ num _ was the best they could do .
my truck had been shuddering and shaking badly at certain rpms & speeds .
the dealer diagnosed the problem as my catalytic convertor and replaced it .
chuck 's speed shop did my block work @ $ _ num _ .
i had already changed the fuel filter .
i chose the carter for $ _ num _ and they looked identical during the swap .
i used a new motorcraft temp gauge too .
virginia told me that they have never heard of `` carter '' .

would definitely recommend them ; ask for robert took my car in as it needed its scheduled maintenance .
they called me and gave me an estimate of over $ 4,000 ?
i told them i wanted a second opinion .
i could kiss this new friend .
luckily , though , i had a ride on the way .
in fact , they washed my car before giving it back to me !
today i took my car in for an oil change ( period ) .
i never asked them to do anything other than an oil change .
they walked me through what must happen and what could wait .
even dropped my car off for me !
i brought in my truck after another shop failed to fix an oil leak .
service was excellent , and communication was great .
the beef curry was excellent .
my first culinary experience at thaiger was several months ago with co-workers .
my thai craving kicked in and i had to have some `` thingy . ''
it was packed inside for a weekday night , which is a good sign .
my tom yum soup and spicy basil chicken were right on the mark .
i was not impressed once .
had lunch here last year , i was presently surprised !
did the tempe pita jungle servers moonlight at wild thaiger ?
we had to search around for the hidden entrance .
perhaps because i was expecting it to be bad , i was pleasantly surprised .
it was pretty good .
all in all i would say it was a score .
the three of us agreed that it would make a good hh spot .
also a real winner were the spicy clear/glass noodles with vegetables and chicken .
they were appropriately strong and actually quite good !
i obliged .
i was blown away by the panang curry .
we had it for take out and it survived the trip home fine .
while the presentation was very nice , the dish itself was just okay .
the one gal who got a noodle dish however said hers was terrific .
most of us got dessert to finish things off .
i got a slice of the mango cheesecake ( very tasty ) .
another person got the lemon ginger cheesecake and was very happy .
we went on wednesday for $ _ num _ wine glass night .
most everyone else got a white wine .
amazingly , when we originally sat down , the restaurant was just about dead .
but after 8:30 pm the place was packed !
the dragon eggs were atrocious .
but the pad thai and beef panang were both good .
and for around $ _ num _ each they were pretty good sized portions .
for dessert the coconut ice cream sprinkled with peanuts is a great ending .
i had high hopes for this restaurant .
i got everything takeout .
it was very good .
i opened my green curry and said : `` where 's the sauce '' ?
there was so little i ca n't comment on the flavor of the curry .
the larger amercian green beans were n't cooked .
that sucked .
the beef was tender enough but the peices were too big .
the tom ka gai soup was fantastic .
recently went back with a party of _ num _ for a bday celebration .
it was only downhill from there .
another _ num _ min later he took our food orders .
_ num _ min later they started coming out , sort of .
seven entrees came out , staggered over a period of five minutes .
chicken underneath was completely flavorless and was dry and veggies were scant .
good thing it was only $ _ num _ .
wild thaiger was never a great option for thai in the valley .
we ordered the peanut chicken and it tasted more like peanut butter chicken .
we sat outside on the covered patio , which was pretty busy .
our server was prompt and pleasant .
the food : i ordered chicken with peanut sauce and jasmine rice .
the sauce was very flavorful , but no heat at all .
now our server did not ask us about stars or heat at all .
got ta recommend all of it !
the corn fritters are crunchy and good , served with jalapenos and cucumber .
the coconut milk-based soup with chicken was a hit around the table .
our server was first rate and unusually sweet .
went to wild thaiger for the first time last night and enjoyed every aspect .
had the wild wrap and dragon eggs for appetizers .
all were prepared very well .
it was by far the best panang we have in phoenix to date .
the beef was fork tender and the sauce flavor was over the top .
server was very friendly and attentive .
this was exactly what brought me there last night .
i was seated immediately upon arrival .
i was not disappointed .
the thai beer i had was wonderful .
i decided on the jungle love ( insert 70s funk music here ) .
it was superb .
it added a great contrast to the mass of vegetables in the pot .
it was exquisite .
i went with two friends and we all enjoyed our meals .
that was my thought when i ate at wild thaiger .
my first visit was a few weeks ago and was for take out .
i decided on the chicken curry lunch special .
it was n't too spicy , just the right amount of kick for me .
and , it was very flavorful and extremely filling .
been here twice .
loved it both times !
we beat him to this place .
lucky for us , with _ num _ people , everyone picked something different .
i had the best beef panang evar !
they even had my favorite desert , the mango and sticky rice .
i took a book , sat by myself and had a great afternoon .
the food was excellent .
service was decent and the wait staff was very attentive .
everything was delicious .
had kimow chicken and must warn , it hot !
had lemon ginger cheescake , was fantastic !
3/5/10 ) , that i had to leave .
i figured i would write a review since i have not yet .
i was surprised at how good this place was .
the food was honestly 4-star worthy , so tasty .
once it arrived , i was pleased with the presentation .
the waitress could have been quite a bit more attentive .
something just seemed a little off about her ?
we started the meal off with the corn fritters .
they were crispy and delicious and had a yummy cucumber chutney with them .
for my entree , i had the tofu mangone and it was awesome .
we finished the meal with the blueberry kaffir lime cheesecake .
it was creamy , cool , and a wonderful way to end a meal .
i went for lunch this time and the service was great .
although it was slightly loud , the food more than made up for it .
it was amazing !
very tasty : ) i used to go here once every two weeks for lunch with my coworkers .
i had my union going away party here on the patio .
ordered take out at 7:15 and was told to give them _ num _ minutes .
they did n't even offer an apology or some sort of concession .
acted like it was normal !
deciding on wild thaiger , i chose to save thai hut for another time .
thai iced tea in hand i reviewed the menu .
the jasmine rice was cooked perfectly .
food was alright .
service was the worst i have ever experienced .
i took almost two hours for us to receive our food .
the tom yum ( or was it tom kah ? )
the lady on the phone said it was not an issue .
we got there and it was packed on a friday night .
the hostess said it would be _ num _ minutes for a table .
literally two seconds later , there was a four person table cleared .
i asked for the table and she got someone to clean it for us .
the place was busy and noisy .
the menu was limited and average priced for most items .
i craved noodles so ordered the pad-seiw .
the noodles were alright .
the hubby had the bbq chicken with coconut rice .
finally got to eat at this place after driving by so many times .
it was fine .
wild thaiger was very cozy and inviting .
the server took another _ num _ minutes to take our drink order .
the thai iced tea was really different but very good .
our main dishes took forever to come out and it was just ok .
the price was also reasonable .
we ordered takeout , and were n't too adventures .
i ordered the beef panang and husband ordered a peanut chicken dish .
there , i said it .
it happened at wild thaiger .
highly recommended !
went on my birthday after st. francis had an hour long wait .
had the ginger martini .
then , we shared the vegetarian appetizer plate .
never had anything like that before .
i had the tofu pad thai , which was perfect !
bathrooms were clean and nicely decorated .
i had a surprising lunch at the thaiger .
maybe it was our fault as we chose outside on a cloudy cool day .
after no response , i went in ordered food .
food was delivered _ num _ minutes later .
then adding insult to injury the food was bland when it arrived .
mike i had the strawberry champagne martini it was very well made .
it was mostly broth with few veggies .
the pad thai was decent .
the green papaya salad was bland needing more lime juice .
we ordered everything medium spice and it came out with no heat .
we came only due to the four star rating .
the cheesy _ num _ 's radio station did n't help .
i was really excited to try this place with my husband on saturday .
i really enjoyed the opportunity to eat outside on such a beautiful day .
the service was pretty bad .
we had to ask for ice tea refills .
we had to ask for additional sweetner packets .
my husband ordered the wild boar .
he thought it was just okay .
i had the eggplant and tofu .
i asked them to add some thai pumpkin to it .
it was super yummy .
the bill was a bit expensive and i wo n't be running back .
it took us over an hour to get our lunch !
it came and was fantastic and most suprisingly light .
i ordered as a main the seafood panang and it was so good .
none of it remained .
my friend ordrered the mango shrimp and ate every bite of that .
i would if i could give it _ num _ stars .
called in another order earlier this week .
it was ready when i got there .
as always , the food was amazing .
come onnnnn !
_ num _ or maybe _ num _ finally got to try wild thaiger .
every other part was perfect .
************* i 'm happy to say it did n't disappoint !
we had appetizers as well as dinner , and everything was sooooooooo tasty !
the presentation was pleasing , the portions outrageously large , and the service exceptional .
still , it was a great experience .
needless to say , i was excited !
alas , at the arrival of my food , i was disappointed .
inside looked clean and the booths are rather private , which is neat .
my biggest complaint was the layout of the menu itself .
tried this place last night ... its very good location with a nice patio .
the food was fresh and was good .
we had our first experience on a friday night about 6:30 .
the servers were pleasant .
the inside was clean with a combo bar and open kitchen .
we started with the freshie rolls with warm peanut sauce and lychee martini .
glad we tried it .
as soon as she entered she was met by a thai staff member .
she asked a question about a menu item .
the responce was simply nasty & for no reason .
we told our friends we had taken there we wouldnt stay & we left .
