no common sense !
the service is awful and you will often receive things you did n't order .
pizza is pretty good !
everything is usually pretty fresh and hot .
there is something about this pizza that is addictive .
overpriced .
the pizza was pretty bland , despite a hefty helping of oregano .
there is very little sauce , fairly dry cheese , and a chewy crust .
i f'in love monicals .
perhaps because i was indoctrinated into loving this pizza as a small child .
i 'm reeeeaaaaally picky about my pizza , but this stuff was great !
we got the thin crust with steak and bacon and it was awesome !
i do n't know what to call it ... ..
i had to knock it down a star .
because every local i know loves monicals .
in fact , they even sell their french dressing online !
seriously , i 've looked . )
the pizza is pretty good , but not the best in champaign-urbana .
i prefer papa del 's .
the food was n't good .
went here after a doctors appointment one day .
the pizza was good .
the small salad was n't their best .
the service sucked .
the waitress did n't give us refills and nothing was clean .
she gave us our check but never came back to take our money .
finally , the manager did .
i will not be back because of the horrible service .
actually , no .
awesome sauce and topping of seasonings .
oooh and a pitcher of fountain root beer is the perfect bev .
fast service , be ready to start eating the salad/breadsticks within minutes of ordering .
gim me some family pleaser now ! ! !
mouth watering .
love monical 's !
family pleaser is the way to go .
awesome thin crust pizza .
the toppings are just right too .
does anyone even order anything else ?
a few years ago but sadly , it closed .
love the food , the service , everything .
good stuff !
overpriced ...
artificially red salad dressing on a boring salad is just terrible ...
honestly , go anywhere else for pizza !
i travel _num_ nights/year for work so i order food a lot .
i could n't believe what i was hearing .
your company knows this ... yet continues to serve it ? ?
?
wo n't make this mistake again .
service was just ok and they actually got our pizza order wrong .
the pizza was missing a topping that we actually paid for .
i like other much cheaper pizza than this .
love the thin crust pizza and the family/neighborhood atmosphere .
the pizza crust is so perfectly crispy .
ca n't go wrong here !
ordered delivery which did n't take long at all .
the location is literally _num_ miles from the house .
should not take this long to replace an item .
going to just go to the store for refund of the sauce and bread .
this is the worst monicals i have ever ate at .
within a month they have messed up _num_ of our pizzas .
the pizzas have been soggy and tuff .
our waitress was rude and did t want to fix the issue .
i called corporate once and i will be placing another call .
avoid this place at all costs !
!
i would suggest picking up your order instead of delivery .
there was an additional location listed for champaign which turns out to be closer .
the pizza was barely warmer than room temperature .
not a terrible place to rent a budget truck from .
nothing special about it , but they get the job done .
luckily , uhaul came through and found a truck for me .
what happened to logical customer service ?
this is a very nice hotel , especially for the price .
breakfast every morning is great ( not healthy ! ) .
the bartender mark is a great guy .
he has a ton of stories , who knows if they are true .
as of last spring , they had a parrot .
that was cool .
wow !
this place is absolutely amazing for the price .
oh , and fresh pineapple too !
i 'm always a sucker for pet parrots .
i 'm really not sure how this place has gotten such high ratings .
i had to have all the bedding replaced .
then when i took a shower , i saw that the towels were dirty .
i 'm not sure what was on them , but it was orange .
the complementary breakfast is not good .
overall , everything about this hotel has been repulsive and disappointing .
unfortunately , i made the mistake of reserving _num_ nights here .
i will never come back .
i 've been staying here over a month due to my job .
this has been over a month of getting breakfast .
the staff is very friendly , and the rooms are comfortable .
everything else was great !
the breakfast is ok ... not great , but decent .
tip your breakfast attendants , people ! ! !
yummm !
all in all , i give it _num_ stars .
the upstairs area was great !
things i loved about eastland suites :
the staff - incredibly attentive , super helpful
breakfast - great for the pricepoint
extended stay - very comfortable & great for business
pool - the kids loved it !
the shuttle !
possible improvements and things to note :
the breakfast crowd varies between week and weekend .
i hired blossom basket for my wedding flowers .
she was patient and helpful as i struggled to figure out my flower design .
the second time i went in , i was paired with a different employee .
she was rude and short with me at times .
used them for my wedding .
brittany was perfect and patient with me being a picky indecisive bride .
everything came out well .
my colors matched perfectly ( even my dream lavender roses ! ! ! )
most importantly..
happy customer : )
great experience with theresa on the phone .
very helpful getting a wedding bouquet to dearest friends from _num_ miles away .
brittany was awesome to work with !
she also put together beautiful table settings filled with hydrangeas .
blossom basket is awesome !
they called me back and arranged to have them delivered anyway ! !
awesome customer service !
made my day , will remember them for future orders .
flowers looked good ... ..for about _num_ hours , then the wilting began .
no luck with calling for any help in complaint .
ownership does n't seem to care .
will go elsewhere next time .
made a last minute order and within hours it was delivered !
: )
the flowers were gorgeous ! !
the service was impeccable .
so we had a predicament , one that blossom basket took care of .
blossom basket is my first stop for all of my floral needs and wants .
the staff is friendly and the quality of the product is exquisite .
i am definitely a fan of blossom basket !
blossom basket replaced the arrangement with a new one right away .
both arrangements were creative and pretty .
i did feel the second one looked better .
what a way to run a quality business .
thank you blossom basket for a job well done !
i could n't believe that they assembled a beautiful bouquet-which lasted for _num_ weeks !
! -and had it delivered within one hour of my call ! !
!
they even sent me pictures by email of the flowers and balloons before delivery .
i highly recommend them and wo n't use anyone else in champaign ! !
!
blossom basket are timely and efficient .
when i call them with an order , they do it right every time .
they are the only florist i call .
blossom basket florist makes beautiful flower arrangements .
i see a lot of them because i work in a hospital .
the blossom basket staff is courteous and friendly .
i highly recommend them .
their hours stink .
now they 've adopted a herd the cattle style of doing business .
take a number & wait .
i guess you can do business this way when you have a monopoly .
if i could go anywhere else i would .
carle medical supply was a great place for me to get my cpap machine .
thanksgiving _num_ , my mother was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer .
mom knew she was in good hands .
they even have kneeling buses for wheelchair dependent citizens .
the mass transit system in champaign-urbana is actually really good !
you can get almost anywhere by the bus !
oh mtd , how i miss you .
i was such an avid bus-rider in champaign-urbana .
there was no need to own a car , really .
moving to los angeles was quite a shock to the system .
enter champaign-urbana mass transit district .
: )
the website is unfortunately abbreviated ( http : //www.cumtd.com ) , but wonderfully comprehensive .
: )
i 've always been pretty indifferent about the cu mtd .
then , today , i read this : http : //www.newsgazette.com/news/local/2009/04/09/no_mtd_service_planned_this_sunday
public transportation is being suspended in observance of a religious holiday .
are you freakin ' kidding me ?
you wo n't be doing it this sunday .
mtd is a great way to get to class when the weather is nasty .
at least the mtd buses are free to students .
and they are a blast when the bars close !
this is my 4rd year in uc and cu mtd is a life saver ...
you can go almost everywhere with them almost anytime .
very useful when you get wind chills of _num_ f ... .
my only complain is that sometimes the rides are too crowded .
i use the bus all the time and it 's a pleasure .
nyc could learn a thing or two too !
i 'm sure it 's only better now .
every ride with him was fun , guy always had something to say .
what a character .
i 'm biased b/c i worked here for two years while on campus .
but this subway is much cleaner than the one on john st .
so one afternoon , stopped by to eat a chicken teriyaki sandwich .
looked pretty good .
they served me a half raw chicken sub !
.
.
do n't wan na think about that .
.
.
great place for subs while running between classes !
it 's great during lunch hours when everything 's packed .
they work real quick , you 're normally out in less than _num_ minutes .
it takes them forever to do anything .
oh noes , not another customer .
: (
the students here are filled to the brim with boredom .
i wanted to get myself some sweet tea but they had none .
this is my favorite place to get my hair cut in all of c-u .
it 's a korean place , yes .
most of the other clients are korean , yes .
please check this place out !
this has been the worst haircut experience of my life .
spend a little bit more money and save yourself the trouble and disappointment .
cheap and did n't mess them up , so i was happy .
i am male .
this is the worst place and the worst stuff i have ever met .
he just use the scissor to scrambling on your head and finish .
right now i have to use gatsby every single day !
!
never ever go this place again .
this might have been the worst hair cut i have ever had .
she easily cut _num_ ( ! ! ! )
inches off of my hair .
i am very very very unhappy .
do not go here !
the korean lady at red hair gives the best hair cuts ever .
the red hair lady cuts so fast , so accurately , and so stylishly .
it was around 12:30pm on a friday and the sign said open .
there were to my knowledge _num_ employees in the salon doing nothing .
i was wrong .
clearly they do n't want my business !
i want a neck massage !
i want to feel sexy !
very disappointed and hurt that my business was not accepted here .
these ladies are pretty adorable .
the haircut , minus the bangs , was perfect .
just the right amount of layering and length .
now ... the bangs .
you need to specify exactly what you want to prevent them from butchering them .
um ... no , not exactly .
friendly service and decently priced for men and women .
make sure you get the lady !
she is really great and very friendly !
she always cuts fast and very stylishly .
also , this place is right on campus , which is great .
needs appointment , my first and only haircut in america in _num_ years .
got my hair cut short and took care of the split ends .
nice korean run place , parking is difficult
love getting my haircut here !
it 's only $ _num_ for a women 's haircut .
yes , book your appointments in advance .
sue and kee are absolutely amazing , they are very skilled and also friendly !
thanks red hair !
first , my apologies for not knowing the names of the hair stylists .
their popularity often means that appointments are booked solid a week in advance .
they 've always used scissors for everything except neck and sideburns .
many of the reviews below are quite dated .
i 'm not korean , and it has never been an issue .
one of the best in champaign area and the hairstylists are wonderful and nice !
i would highly recommend this place to anyone who needs a nice haircut !
one of the best in champaign area and the hairstylists are wonderful and nice !
i would highly recommend this place to anyone who needs a nice haircut !
overpriced and never again especially for female haircuts .
i went there today and asked to curl my hair with a straightener .
she told me no .
later she told me she did perms to my hair
so dont go here no one speaks proper english and messes up with your hair
they were professional and courteous .
mid price _num_ $ for men 's haircuts .
they only take cash , which seemed strange .
they took their time and listened to what i wanted .
overall , i would go again but not in love with the place .
the barber is highly skilled and easy to communicate with .
definitely will come next time .
you know , i actually like rock 's .
not bad .
rock 's is a decent bar/pub/grill/patio spot that is pleasant in the summer heat .
i can tell you right now that you are very wrong .
second , the bar has a much better atmosphere for watching the big game .
lastly , they serve the best horseshoes anywhere near campus .
my friends and i would go to rocks just to get horseshoes .
you really have to go just to try one .
screw conservatives idea of planned parenthood .
so are you sans health insurance ?
it differs based on income .
plus , the staff is helpful , friendly , comforting and very knowledgeable .
oh and !
need a refill on your birth control but do n't have contraceptive coverage ?
or need birth control and are too afraid to get your parents ' permission ?
we are living in _num_ .
the sweetest planned parenthood i 've been to .
it 's obvious that they are heavily needed here .
this also means appointments fill up fast so do n't dawdle , y'hear ?
it can take up to two weeks depending on the procedure .
they have the requisite beach sunset pictures on the ceiling also , heh .
outside of the cliche and tired pro-life/choice argument ( nobody is pro-abortion .
ever .
way to address the sexy white elephant in the room .
the people who work here are really sweet and informative .
the ob-gyn who was there was fantastic .
this saved me a ton of cash .
yay , let 's continue to oppress women 's sexuality !
it was an outrage .
...
unbelievable ... i am considering a lawsuit .
i have never seen more unprofessional behavior .
i recently went to planned parenthood for my birth control needs .
as a low-income graduate student , i qualify for the illinois healthy women program .
my health care practitioner was professional , courteous , and very friendly .
she made what could have been an uncomfortable experience rather pleasant !
i have already recommended champaign 's planned parenthood to my friends .
they went above and beyond for quality care and service .
it 's now a beautiful , modern facility .
good riddance .
quick quiz ... . what 's worse than going to planned parenthood ?
... tick , tock ...
ready for the answer ?
!
!
most of the time , the staff is great .
they are cheerful and seemingly happy to be doing their job .
i wish i remembered their names , but i do n't .
i felt like i was in an interrogation room right from the start .
at the time , i really felt intruded upon .
i did n't want to get pregnant , and that should have been enough .
so why three stars ?
because i think this is a valuable service .
most of the time their providers are great .
do doctors have bad days ?
i am sure they do .
i 'm also sure they do that as well .
one that did n't want this job and was perhaps having a bad day .
bottom line is ... it 's not super professional .
it happens , though .
nonetheless , they have always given me the information and services i needed .
the staff in champaign is amazing .
by far the best gynecology people i have ever been to .
they are very sweet and understanding .
the nurse practitioner went very slow and explained everything as she did it .
and she made conversation !
i am no longer afraid of my yearly !
completely incompetent staff .
request of renewal denied by doctor '' .
way to improperly utilize your resources .
i have been going to this location for a couple of years now .
i have always loved the staff they go above and beyond for people .
as well as help forward a prescription in a hurry .
i am sad to be moving away from the awesome people here .
excellent and knowledgeable staff .
clean and comfortable location .
easy to make an appointment .
wide array of services and the staff are ready to answer any questions .
they like the campus and the teachers .
i have lots of friends who have attended this school .
there 's lots this school has to offer .
check this school out .
how did they put it ?
'at illnois , you 're not a number , you 're nine numbers . '
i loved the big ten games and the energy of the campus .
i would never have picked a different place to spend four years !
it 's a place that is easy to both love and hate .
the first test average was a _num_ % and there was no curve .
grading is harsh here !
lots of people repeat classes .
las is the catch-all college that gets shafted a lot .
many of my lectures were too big and in auditoriums were literally falling apart .
oh well .
i 've had my smallest and favorite classes in aces .
i adore most of my professors i have had in this college .
i recommend aces , but only if you are truly interested in the curricula .
_num_ classes are where learning goes to die .
i did that a lot and it was worth it for the english-speaking tas .
the drunken anti-intellectual environment can be stifling if you do n't find a niche .
i like the chambana area , even if it has some minor annoyances .
the weather here is horrible .
you are always meeting new people who are cool and interesting .
oh , and a $ _num_ tuition raise over _num_ years- wtf !
face it .
college is just a stepping stone to work .
i have to say that uiuc did its job .
come here for memorable experiences and lifelong friends .
oh wait .
you can probably get that anywhere else .
what more do you want ?
to whom it may concern at the uiuc ,
thank you for finally dropping the chief as your mascot .
you held out so long for more alumni dollars .
you should be so proud .
good riddance !
the chief was a total badass , enough said .
it 's a perfect distance from chicago .
go illini
like much in life , you get out of uiuc what you put in .
i guess so , but that would n't be much fun .
i earned a ba and an ms from uiuc .
champaign-urbana ... you either love it or you do n't .
it is n't chicago and it is n't the suburbs .
i 'm still here , so obviously i love it .
good school .
go .
hail to the orange
hail to the blue
hail alma mater
ever so true ... ( so truuuuueeeee )
we love no other
so let our motto be :
`` victory , illinois ( sssssss ) ,
var-si-ty ! ''
greatest _num_ years of my life .
ill-ini - illini til i die !
let 's take a cornfield and build two cities in it .
now let 's take these cities and drop a university right where they intersect .
oh wait , someone already did that .
it 's called the university of illinois at urbana champaign .
just sayin ' ... .
!
big enough that you will find your place in it .
but only if you look .
enjoy your time , do n't waste it away complaining or being afraid .
seriously .
go to one of each type of sports event at least once .
play frisbee or sunbathe on the quad at least once .
slip on the ice on your way to class at least once .
use a fake id at least once .
got it ?
good .
do n't waste it , its over before you know .
i 'm a fan .
no better way to be surrounded by so many different people .
fantastic .
i transferred into uiuc at _num_ as a junior .
they all felt i was especially when they found out how old i was .
uic has an average age of _num_ and much higher diversity rates .
that and it is in my wonderful city of chicago .
i also transferred into uiuc at _num_ .
what university is n't this way ?
but you do have to want to .
ill-ini !
the caveat ?
you have to work for it .
it 's not dropped in your lap .
the diversity is out there .
but it 's there .
the classes here are top notch .
i studied engi-nerding , so maybe i 'm biased .
but it 's not so much what i actually learned in class .
oskee-wow-wow !
great school .
its the perfect mix of academics and college life , in my opinion .
( at least for engineers )
my profs were great , greek system was great ( yeah sk and triangle !
i am a very proud alumna .
go illini ! !
ill-ini !
i previously went to marquette university for my freshman and sophomore years .
i only wish that i had decided to go there in the first place .
this is a great academic institution .
i love it here .
this is classic college at its finest .
as a lower classman , your classes are large and very tough .
they are unofficially called weed courses .
they `` weed '' out the students that ca n't handle them .
they ensure that the strong students continue and succeed .
this is a very large university .
illinois has a large international student population , making it incredibly diverse .
illinois has also been a pioneer in handicap accessibility since the 1970s .
the opportunities here are amazing and available to everyone .
large universities are not for everyone .
regardless , it 's still one of the best in higher education .
it 's gigantic , yet full of personality and character .
bricks ! !
yay ! ! ! '' )
it 's daunting , but not insurmountable .
that said , the school 's trying .
i 'm thankful for that .
there 's a strong organizing tradition here .
people *care* about things , and it 's nice to see .
campus is very spread out .
not forests .
hail to the orange ,
hail to the blue ,
hail alma mater ,
ever so true !
we love no other
so let our motto be
victory , illinoisssssssssssssss !
varsity !
long live the chief !
perhaps more importantly , it did prepare me for the world that came after .
the only good thing about champaign is the school itself .
there are a bunch of interesting characters and plenty to do .
the school offers a variety of classes to produce well rounded and worldly graduates .
there are resources to help with interviewing skills , resumes , and job connection .
there is nothing like supporting your school and bleeding orange and blue .
if i could go back in time to relive it all , i would !
it is the quintessential college experience !
one of the best research institutions in the world with many high ranking programs .
one of the greatest research institutions that exists .
i-l-l..
i-n-i
i am so proud to call this place my alma mater .
i was in awe at how beautiful the old buildings were .
yes , you heard that right .
_num_ .
sixteen .
one six .
socially , this place is a mess .
i highly recommend roland realty .
other than that , there are some aspects i will miss .
they are that friendly .
need a permit or a document ?
go to office a .
office a tells you to go to office b .
seriously , though .
nowhere .
i had a great time here , majored in spanish and minored in french .
i supported myself and my family all because of my degree from here .
then i did and then my younger sister did .
for us , there are n't any other colleges .
i l l
i n i
what 's up with that ?
i would think there would be a better representation of many racial groups there .
also , i saw a billboard for an african american homecoming dance .
is homecoming segregated ?
is discrimination a problem at u of i ?
ignore the haters .
join a student organization , or better yet , start one .
find some ethnic cuisine you 've never tried before .
skip the campus bars every now and then and try out downtown champaign .
pull an all-nighter in the ugl .
go to your professor 's office hours for a change .
pick up some b movies at that 's rentertainment .
play intramural sports .
get a job at a dorm dining hall and make lifelong friends .
watch some kids play dance dance revolution extremely well in the illini union .
read a book of poems on the quad .
i 'm not a frat bro .
nothing like one .
you see , i was a student there from _num_ to _num_ .
the university was less selective in admissions at that time .
indeed i had a roommate who flunked out in his senior year .
yes , marketing .
things do not change over time .
freshmen got drunk at kam 's and puked all over the sidewalk .
very pretty view and lots of stores , restaurants , bars ...
good combination of academic and party life .
had my master here in communication .
good class content but not much help in career .
i 'm writing this review as a uiuc graduate .
i attended 2008-2012 and i received an undergraduate degree in biology .
positives :
-the campus is really beautiful and generally visually appealing .
the architecture is fantastic .
as you walk around campus , it feels quintessential .
it 's especially college-looking in the fall .
( you know , like all the brochures that get sent out . )
-you are only required to live on campus freshmen year .
it 's much cheaper than on-campus housing with a meal plan .
-you 'll meet some of your best friends for life here .
it 's the midwest .
people are friendly .
it 's a small world for such a big school .
-we host some pretty epic events here .
like unofficial .
i do n't think i need to say anything more about that .
-your education is whatever you make of it .
other people slide by and only go to class when there 's an exam .
negatives :
-this school is expensive .
i graduated almost three years ago and i 'm still swimming in debt .
-greek life can somewhat overwhelm the social scene at times .
-urbana/champaign has nothing going for it except for the university .
everything in the area caters to college students .
no wonder drinking is so big here .
sometimes there is n't much else to do .
-a lot of lab/research opportunities are for graduate students only .
unfortunately they did not maintain high standards .
now the great professors are retiring .
the last ten years have been a nightmare of mismanagement .
perhaps the university will be turned around by the new president .
but for now , there are many great universities to attend in the us .
some neighboring states offer in state tuition to illinois residents .
if you want to party hardy , illinois is the place to go .
steer clear of the college of media entirely .
but some should be avoided completely .
amidst all the financial scandals , the lincoln theater does look quite impressive .
the little courtyards house the bricks bearing names of the donations .
some of the bricks looked unsteady on the bumpy ground .
hopefully no ones brick breaks .
the bell tower in the mathematics building was unfortunately closed .
we missed the narrow window of 12:30-1 pm , for a tour .
parking was challenging even just to find a metered spot .
the university of illinois is really moving upwards and always trying to improve itself .
we had an info session and tour for my brother yesterday .
our tour guide was not .
most questions were answered with `` i do n't know '' .
not helpful .
the dorm we saw was so small .
i know if my brother attends he will be in private housing .
the campus itself was gorgeous , very spread out and green .
i just do n't think we got the best first impression .
the kam was sort of the chicago mca equivalent for me .
favorite place on campus to see a performance !
impressive , yes ?
pretentious , no .
wow !
this place is definitely three steps up from the typical university art museum .
i am so glad we did !
the space is gorgeous , too -- much bigger than i expected .
do n't miss it !
this museum rocks , especially for a university .
a few friends and i had so much fun wandering the place .
there 's a great one about baggage right now .
went for a friend ; she was opening her mfa exhibition .
one half star knocked off 'cuz was extra-tempted by her claims of wine .
sadly , they only served soda .
any art opening should have wine , people .
that 's how you tempt folks into gettin ' a little culture .
great museum on a terrific college campus .
check it out next time you are in c-u .
the east wing is haunted .
five stars .
a perfectly nice university museum .
nice university museum but certainly not the best i have seen .
you definitely get your money 's worth with her large beautiful arrangements .
beautiful flowers , great customer service ! !
!
i used april 's florist for my wedding , seven years ago .
she did a wonderful job .
worked with me on price , design , etc .
everything was wonderful and she was fun to talk and plan with .
they were so pretty .
april 's is my go-to place for flowers .
april 's has consistently delivered great arrangements and smiles !
highly recommended and will visit again !
i had never heard of april 's florist before finding them online .
my first thought was that they were a bit pricey .
she said they were the best floral arrangement she had ever gotten .
she sent me a picture and i expected less than what you see online .
but they looked exactly like the online advertisement .
i will never use another florist in champaign/normal , again .
was in and out in under _num_ minutes .
so 10/10 on service !
i got my flowers and boy were they beautiful and super fresh !
mixed bag ... but cheap .
meat quality tends to be iffy .
this is the place to go for cheap chinese food in campustown .
the food is not fancy but will fill you up when you 're hungry .
my personal favorite is their spicy fish filet .
what the heck is some of the best chinese cuisine anywhere doing in champaign ?
they make other dumpling/potsticker selections look pretty pathetic by comparison in size and flavor .
my preferred place to eat chinese on campus .
their general tso 's chicken is amazing .
unless you 're sharing it with someone else .
it tasted okay , but not great .
i doubt i can be completely objective ; i love the place too much .
i mean , i 've watched the family 's kids grow up !
i recommend the general tso 's chicken .
the flavor of the sauce is amazing and the consistency of the chicken excellent .
sit by the window and watch the campus walk by below ... great location .
best general tso 's chicken i have ever had , and i 'm chinese .
but man , is it spicy !
one of the best fast-food chinese places i 've ever eaten at .
definitely go here when you have the hankering for chinese .
after my first order from this place i would n't dare order again .
i got the double sauteed pork with `` fried rice . ''
i ca n't believe there are so many positive reviews of this place .
never ordering from this place again .
the campus chinese place to go is lai-lai , period .
empire is cheap , super fast , and generally satisfying .
dishes may be slightly greasy , but they 're tasty as hell .
even for a cheap chinese place the atmo leaves much to be desired .
and i 'm not at all fussy about that .
my friend had a tofu dish that was ok .
tasted like bbq sauce mixed with teriyake .
but i was n't in the mood for meat .
so ...
i got the veggie lo mein .
until here !
bland , boring , and worst of all , super greasy .
it felt like oil slicks in my mouth .
arrgh .
why ?
really fast and really reasonably priced .
the food is delicious and the portions are well worth it .
definitely my favorite chinese food on the u of i campus .
now that 's what i call mediocre !
i 'm not a snob when it comes to chinese food at all .
my previous experiences at empire have been pretty good .
it 's still a good amount of food for the money .
i do n't usually review boring chinese places , but well here i am .
empire is my go-to place for cheap chinese food .
the food is good enough and the price is low .
stopped by empire yesterday for some quick takeout .
cons : decor was sort of confusing and borderline gross .
we wondered what had been living in the empty fishtank near the door .
the biggest con , however ?
the food .
my friends got sweet and sour chicken .
they said it was alright .
the fried rice was bright yellow - almost saffron-y in color .
unnatural .
the egg roll was disappointing .
i had the pork with 'string beans , ' a.k.a .
green beans and white rice .
i really love this family-owned/ran business .
i love the general 's or orange chicken .
best crab rangoon ever .
$ _num_ gets you _num_ .
complete steal .
empire also finally takes cc 's , but there 's lame $ _num_ min .
this is my favorite place to eat chinese food on campus .
you ca n't go wrong with any schezuan beef or brocoli and beef .
also , i would highly recommend the dry chili chicken off the chinse menu .
that dish is amazing .
but boy am i glad we tried it .
empire is cheap .
each time we order delivery it lasts at least _num_ meals .
that said , their dishes are hit and miss .
in general , the chinese menu items ( house specialty/szechuan ) have been awesome .
one time , though , we ordered the lemon chicken .
the portion is always huge and i bring home leftovers .
they also offer free hot tea and water during your meal .
i really wish i had this place nearby , i miss it .
yummmmm .
the staff was friendly and helpful and the food came out pretty quickly .
i would come back .
their food is amazing , best chinese food i 've had hands down .
tried the shrimp fried rice .
i think it 's safe to say i 'm never going back .
but they do serve congee !
had some solid pepper steak .
food seems decent overall and portions are priced well .
i highly recommend the hunan pork and pork egg foo yong .
the free tea is great as well !
when my wife was in vet school we ate here every week .
the general tsos tofu was amazing as was the mai fun and mu shu .
no dining room or kitchen .
environment is quiet crowded and messy .
had their fried fish thing with some vegetable .
never want to try again
it is good for different dishes have different feeling .
there 's nothing really special besides the free tea .
highly recommended !
same flavor as dishes in taiwan !
the best chinese restaurant in champaign !
the place is kinda dumpy but i like the food ...
this is one of the only places on campus that i 'd get chinese .
the taste is good , too , maybe not the best but indeed good .
i will recommend it to people especially chinese people .
good food !
typical hole in the wall chinese place .
frequented this establishment many times during college and was always satisfied .
cheap and huge portions .
low marks for bathroom cleanliness though .
a little excessive on the starbuck 's bashing though ... hoorah pretention !
raspberry almond scones .
raspberry almond scones .
raspberry almond scones .
to both kill ... and die for .
'nuff said .
however , the bathroom is terrifyingly small .
that is a problem .
otherwise , kick ass spot .
even the bagels are great .
: )
this is my daily coffee stop .
affordable .
small .
quiet .
and oh my gosh , did i mention the oatmeal raisin cookies ?
ahhhhhh no wonder people here are so round .
recently i found a cockroach in the bathroom !
ewww : (
it used to be good .
but today the barista made me so mad !
it 's like a sunday evening and there 's seriously no one here .
it 's not busy .
there 's no line .
it 's not like i took a long time deciding what i wanted .
wth ?
what was this nice service that everyone speaks off ?
geez .
i 'm like a regular too .
.
.
coming here about 5x / week .
ugh i 'm so mad
really , the worst of the espresso locations on campus .
first of all , they never put a sleeve on the cup .
second of all , the coffee is nearly always burnt .
come on !
how hard is it to brew a cup .
listen .
it balances things out .
foam the milk , do n't scorch it .
it 's supposed to be foamy not watery .
no , coffee is not supposed to taste like burnt acid .
they must be making money hand over fist .
i guess that 's your way of being funny too ?
it 's still not balancing out .
the flavor is very robust and espresso tends toward a darker roast .
favorite to drink : hazelnut americano .
there 's something about the way they prepare drinks that really works for me .
i 'm sure i 'll be back at least once a leep weekend .
the obvious choice for gslis students and staff ; we 're heavily caffeinated .
good place to grab some coffee between classes .
baristas were a little cranky , but not overly so .
stick to starbucks or dunkin donuts .
the drinks are almost always tasty and the food is pretty good .
i like the chicken salad sandwich , which has cranberries in it .
nom .
baked goods are ok but a bit overpriced .
overall , good stuff .
i 'm not sure why it took me so long to frequent this place .
i ordered a soy latte with hazelnut syrup and it was delicious .
inside was quiet and spacious .
there is plenty of seating between the upstairs and the downstairs .
love to get coffee here whenever i 'm in champaign !
it sells coffee and iced tea .
it 's drinkable .
the lemon bars are good .
at least it 's not another starbucks ?
the coffee here is atrocious .
they combined the two in my cup .
i asked for less milk , hoping to be able notice some coffee flavor .
but i still have a 10-oz .
cup of flavorless grey water .
tried some coffee here and it was alright .
slightly cheaper than starbucks and like their bakery .
always grabbed sth in the afternoon before i go to class
third strike , you 're out !
i 've given this place three opportunities to _num_ .
provide service with a smile and not an attitude .
and _num_ .
provide a drink that i could actually swallow .
ick .
sop .
bring the mop !
it tasted as if it were loaded with white pepper .
sick .
i wo n't return .
starbucks became starbucks for a reason .
it taste good .
as for the coffee ...
i do n't know what to say .
it 's caffeinated .
sure .
other than ...
i avoid getting the espresso drinks ( cappuccinos , lattes , etc . )
the drink craftsmanship is nil .
the matcha latte ...
it 's just milk , dude .
it 's milk .
it 's not a matcha latte .
it 's milk .
and half and half .
all of their mixed drinks are milk .
the drinks , like everything else there , are overpriced for their quality .
i recommend the cold press .
this place is as expensive as starbucks coffee .
the only difference is at espresso royal , you get a lower quality cup .
with the starbucks right down the street it is not worth going here .
the only day worth visiting is on wednesday because they have one dollar lattes .
the seating is pretty cramped .
i have no complaints about the staff .
they have been very friendly .
i 've never had a problem with service here and love the drinks .
the food is mediocre cafe food , but that 's how the all are !
i go here instead of the slightly closer to my office starbucks every time .
i could not have been happier leasing from roland realty .
i lived at 702/704 w elm st in urbana for a year .
i have no complaints about the management .
they were fair with returning the security deposit .
it was relatively cheap , however .
despite my issues with the building , i almost stayed for a second year .
i would definitely recommend living with roland .
lofts _num_ terrible !
terrible customer service .
rob you blind at every turn .
immature and unprofessional staff .
yes , that 's right even worse that cpm .
lived at lofts _num_ for a year .
not at all from my experience .
_num_ ) i lost my keys to my apartment .
they said no because it 's not fair for my roommates safety .
they refused , and charged me $ _num_ dollars !
for some reason they charged me for the key fob after i moved out .
what a bunch of dicks !
we have had a very positive experience with roland ; more specifically with kurt .
in fact , we will be renting from them next year .
i live in one of roland 's smaller buildings in champaign .
they are the best landlord i 've ever had .
you can pay the rent online and submit work orders online .
the office guys are very nice and helpful .
i would rent from them again in a heartbeat .
i recently went back and the place had gone waaay downhill .
dazzling nails saved the day .
every nail salon i could reach was closed except this place .
both of the women who did our mani-pedis were quick but very thorough .
the service was very conscientious and friendly , and the cost very reasonable .
my friend also got her eyebrows waxed at the last minute :
- manicure $ _num_
- pedicure $ _num_
- eyebrows $ _num_
i highly recommend this cheap yet thorough salon .
so worth the walk down green street ! !
appointments are taken ( not necesary ) because the wait is never too long .
manicures are only $ _num_ and pedicures $ _num_ .
english is spoken here also .
i have to echo what elizabeth t. said about this place !
it is literally the only nail salon open on sunday afternoon in champaign !
everyone was very nice and accommodating .
this is nicely added touch as it made the hour or so fly by !
definitely worth checking out if you 're in town !
both times i 've gone the salon has been packed .
the first time i went i got a shellac no-chip manicure .
i get lots of compliments on how great my toes look .
i would highly recommend this salon to anyone .
probably my top nail spot so far in champaign/urbana .
they do a nice job and listen to what you want .
i recommend bringing your own flip flops or whatever .
i was so glad i chose this salon .
i think i may be getting my nails done on a regular basis now !
thanks for the great night and wonderful service/product .
they cleaned up my cuticles and dead skin so everything looks nice and smooth .
the massage chair was awesome !
everyone was nice .
but for _num_ bucks , i definitely got my money 's worth .
today was my first visit here so i went with an open mind .
it was pretty much what i expected and nothing much exceptional .
quick & cheap .
they shouted back and forth and laughed very loudly .
it was very annoying .
i did not feel comfortable in this place .
it was n't the cleanest either .
it is unlikely i 'll return in the future .
not a bad spot to get a quick and cheap manicure .
it 's not a fancy place but the staff are very nice and efficient .
good color choices like most other places opi and essie .
it 's very inexpensive .
i think _num_ for a basic manicure .
they also have no chip and other services .
terrific .
clean and many great color choices .
close to campus and all nail techs have tons of experience .
walk in or appointments .
the prices are very reasonable .
way better than campus nails and the same price .
after waiting _num_ minutes patiently ...
one lady started working on her while i proceeded to wait another _num_ minutes .
there 's no organization and it is just ridiculous ! ! ! !
will never come back ever
disgusting place - unhygienic conditions :
it showed me that she did n't even antiseptisized them .
- manicurists borrowed tools from each other .
after using the tools they 've just returned tools to this dirty mug .
wtf ?
!
they do not clean their own furniture and floor .
disgusting .
this is very strange for me .
absolutely pitiful
i went to get my nails and toes done and left so unhappy .
my nails are all shapes and sizes , none remotely straight .
i am currently walking home to redo my nails .
gross and unhygenic salon .
not a lot of nail salons open on sunday here .
the prices are okay .
i got a manicure .
the entire salon and nail stations were disgusting .
there was a layer of acrylic dust on everything .
definitely will not be returning here .
the place was terrible .
thanks tao : )
these+ladies do an excellent job on my eyebrows every time !
they totally deserve it .
they do a fantastic job on nails too !
i seriously love this place .
great salon .
awesome service .
i got french tips for my toe nails and they look beautiful .
i have n't been to this bergners in a very long time .
the selection was very limited and picked over and in very bad disarray .
however , i was able to find a few suits to try on .
in broken english she said go ahead .
i had to wait for a dressing room .
when i finally got a room i started to get undressed .
talk about awkward .
i had no idea men were allowed in woman 's dressing rooms these days !
then i saw a face peeking out from underneath the partition .
she did but her parents did nothing and said nothing .
after i bought the suit i went to macy 's .
from now on i will be going to macy 's first ! ! !
!
i like this store but their female help in the upstairs needs improvement .
tell marnetta to bring more of the cute girls from downstairs up there !
need that to round out the `` upscale '' shopping experience .
*update*
see rachel 's review several months after mine .
wadya know .
she also has experienced the fine service of local proleteriat women .
hey rachel , was she homely ?
i only went in to grab a shirt very quickly .
i felt completely rushed and a bit chastised , which i hate .
i made the selection without delay .
we were not the only ones left shopping by an means .
this woman 's behavior was flat out rude and off-putting and completely inexcusable .
it 's a piece of junk .
the only thing you can use this worthless coupon on is their junk .
like those stupid little thoughtless gifts they offer this time of year .
who needs that ? ?
?
!
i find at least something to buy there most of the time .
they have `` saved '' so much money using them .
and they come once a month .
selection is ok and they have a good amount of petites .
service is hit or miss .
store review :
otherwise the clothing selection is above average .
they have a home good section as well on the more expensive side .
pros : department store variety
cons : smaller store , coupons are hard to use
hidden deals :
sign up for the email club for special coupon savings
slightly target older people .
have some sophisticated brands like calvin klein or columbus .
but even with their yellowdot sales all the time .
still pretty pricy
the bulbs are n't hot , and the customer service was poor .
it was not worth fighting campus traffic to get there .
i went for lip and eye brow waxing .
they are by appointment only .
did a great job on my brows specially .
i would go again .
~~~
never do business here .
never .
~~~
allow me to elaborate .
we spent _num_ minutes here waiting to make a 4-minute transaction .
we rented a truck online and had our confirmation email and receipt with us .
not helpful .
needless to say , this business ranks among the most poorly run in town .
good news for them is their survival seems secured by a lack of competition .
all in all , i have no qualms about returning for equipment rentals .
also , they tend to be slammed fri-sun , so be prepared to wait .
i called to make a reservation for a truck .
i was told that i had a 4-hour reservation for a $ _num_ truck .
this is absolutely obsurd customer service .
recently moved from champaign to wyoming .
the folks at this place were really helpful and i appreciate it .
anyway , thanks !
i ordered a _num_ ' truck with no extras for my move .
this place is awful !
the employees are either dumb or just do n't give a shit .
they 're unorganized and totally clueless .
i have never used a business so poorly run .
or maybe they 're all this bad .
terrible .
quick summary
-- -
had a reservation for a truck at 12:45 pm on 8/10 .
came to the store at 12:30 , got my truck at 2:15 .
no that 's not a typo .
on the flip side , all the trucks seem to be well-maintained .
that 's the only flip side .
every other aspect of this experience was hell .
review
-- -
u-haul on university , words can not express how much u-suck .
*canned laughter*
i 've used u-haul to move before on two occasions .
nope .
it 's okay , calm down .
there 's only five people in front of you .
gray .
lifeless .
the interior looked so depressing .
the face of the gm was equally lifeless and depressing .
gray is fine .
i love gray ... just not dusty gray .
not more-dilapidated-than-sears gray .
not it's-sucking-the-life-out-of-you gray .
that aside , the service was beyond slow .
i knew from the past two experiences that i should get in early .
no , friends .
it did n't take _num_ minutes to get my truck .
it took _num_ hour and _num_ minutes to get my truck .
the gm was serving people at the speed of snail .
legends say that he is still waiting in line at the store today .
# suckstosuck # 3spooky5me
the gm never greeted me .
never looked at me .
never thanked me .
did n't even apologize for the excruciatingly long wait .
worst customer service ever .
i finished my paperwork and was told to wait outside for him .
i finally walked out of that hell hole and got some fresh air .
_num_ minutes .
_num_ minutes .
maybe he 's having trouble finding the key to my truck ?
_num_ minutes .
okay now i 'm getting mad .
where is he ?
i walk back into the store to see him exactly where i left him .
at the desk helping another customer .
what about my truck bro ? ? ?
i could n't believe it .
keys are already inside . ''
as if he could n't have told me that from the beginning ?
this place scores awful out of _num_ .
i rented a truck in july for a one-way move .
so i decided to make a second personal appearance .
the process took about an hour .
also , the boxes that i bought there fell apart .
my truck was already fitted with a hitch but no wiring .
i ca n't say enough good things about her .
i am a regular renter at the u-haul on university avenue .
in fact , i usually rent anywhere from 2-5 times per year .
in fact , things have always been above and beyond great .
i really did n't know the first thing about what i needed to buy .
they make it easy and explained everything .
this location is weird .
their customer service is terrible .
this is unacceptable .
this place needs at least two more employees , and better customer service .
have rented an open trailer here on occasion to move things within town .
it 's fine but such a hassle for a $ _num_ rental .
it ends up costing me around _num_ minutes .
i can rent a $ 20,000 new car with much less hassle .
seriously ? ? ?
on the day of pick up - the computer system was `` down '' .
no other locations nearby were open or had available trailers in any size .
mr. hubbard was rude , inconsiderate , and unhelpful .
he made no effort to reach a resolution .
he made degrading and insulting remarks in my ability to understand the situation .
many other customers were affected on this same day .
the employees at the establishment were eager and willing to help .
with some direction and resources provided from management , the locationwould immensely improve .
-- -- i contacted uhaul customer service with no response or resolution
terribly slow .
we arrive here at 12:00pm just to return the car .
terrible service .
yum !
sweet !
and oh my god , it tastes soo good .
the equation for the tastiness goes something like this ...
y = t*x^2
where t is a function of how late it is ,
y is the yum factor ,
double 11-in .
sub special is their best offer .
i went here on the recommendation of my colleague at work .
also , i can get a dill pickle instead of chips .
otherwise it was a very pleasant experience and i enjoyed it !
i will be back !
excellent decision .
could n't really ask for more .
pretty good variety of sandwiches .
their sandwiches are pretty big too and they do n't skimp on the meat .
it 's a step up from jimmy john 's and subway for sure .
other locations do much better than this one , it 's a shame really .
fast delivery .
drivers are friendly .
i ended up getting a free sandwich .
definitely my favorite .
i finally decided to give this place a try .
the place seemed clean and the workers were friendly .
i had the california gulch on wheat and my friend had the steam engine .
the sandwich overall had a clean taste .
it 's better than subway , and more expensive too .
great bread , much better than subway and slightly better than jimmy john 's .
the sandwich selection is great .
the only downside is the wait time .
when it is slow it can take _num_ minutes plus to get a sandwich .
it seems they are severely understaffed .
also when we have had it delivered it has take an hour plus .
did n't even get to try it .
i had ordered online and had prepaid a pretty generous tip .
great subs .
poor silver mine subs being right next to subway .
also , there 's free wifi here .
not a sub fan .
all sandwich stores taste the same with me .
just had their delivery at my job and their steak sandwich is pretty good .
?
i got home and began to tear into the sub .
i was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was .
however , i would n't call it the best sub i 've ever eaten .
i will be sure to go there again and try more items .
i came here for some quick and fast subs .
that 's not what i got .
my time was absolutely wasted .
i 've had the comstock before and it 's decent .
the dodge city also was n't bad either .
tasted pretty fresh and put together really well .
friendly guys behind the counter .
i saved over $ _num_ with the hooked deal and the subs were good .
5/5 this time !
my absolute fav shot is the ***t-bomb*** !
it 's ciclon and red bull .
got ta try it , if you have n't already .
i 've been looking for it in chicago , but no bars carry ciclon !
do not try to go here at _num_ in the morning .
very long line and its usually one in one out .
two levels , so you can sit upstairs and watch the crowd from above .
decent music and great wings ( i think they still have wing night ) .
i fully second the t-bombs !
long lines after _num_ am .
free cover for _num_ + , $ _num_ for under _num_ .
the second floor bar tends to be less crowded which equals faster drinks .
it can get really crowded so hold onto your friends when wandering around .
basically just a sports bar with enough room for people to dance as well .
other than that though , it 's pretty fun .
's , and they have pretty good specials here .
the decor is bar-ish .
drink selection is decent .
loud .
large .
really cool space inside !
girls are pretty dressed up , guys notsomuch .
cheap drinks .
i 'd never wait in line or pay cover to get inside though ...
brothers :
it 's your run of the mill college bar .
cheap drinks
good music
crazy dancing
one of your few redeeming qualities is that you have bass on tap .
i still believe this , even though i seriously have no idea why .
always will have a place in my heart !
oh holy crap .
i was blown away .
hands down my favorite bar on campus .
another 'older ' crowd bar since it 's no cover for 21+ .
though twice my underaged friend went and got the overage wristband .
hmm .
pool tables on the first level .
photo hunt games on the upstairs bar area .
watch the stairs though !
oops !
been awhile since i 've been here .
i do n't know how much it has changed since
i loathed this place .
ca n't go wrong with brothers .
large airy bar that seems to be a great place to catch a game .
not as good as the iowa location , but worth checking out .
seriously .
amazing specials on a saturday night .
friendly bartenders that recommend new and exciting brews/drinks even when the place is crowded .
it 's hard not to love a place with that kind of attitude !
hate this bar .
the only good time to go is when it 's nearly empty .
i do n't get why people go here just for the wings .
i 've had good times at brothers .
i 've had bad times at brothers .
it gets too crowded to play darts .
guard your jacket unless you want a free drink spilled on it .
past 11pm the bathroom resembles a slip and slide .
it seems to be totally random .
the bathroom is completely and absolutely unusable .
never wasting my time at brother 's again .
overpriced and dirty .
never had any good memories from this place .
why i so strongly dislike brothers :
_num_ ) you will go home deaf .
guaranteed .
my ears hurt more than anywhere else i 've been .
_num_ ) never enough space .
_num_ ) the people at brothers tend to be so completely and utterly hammered .
disgusting .
_num_ ) hot as hell .
there 's no air circulation whatsoever .
you 'll be sweating just standing there even in the middle of winter .
the fans on the ceiling are useless .
go elsewhere !
just been there once .
more like a sports bar and super crowded and not really relaxing .
have no place to stand or sit .
floor s dirty
i 'll be back !
i like the lofted floor plan here .
beer selection is quite good .
prices not bad .
nothing special though .
crazy cheap for an alum used to chicago bar prices .
tried the broski for four .
way better than brothers in iowa city , i can tell you that much .
also sometimes their music is just kind of weird .
if you want somewhere to go and dance , this is definitely not it .
i have a sweet spot for gameday .
they have a good selection , but wow is this stuff expensive .
done and done .
they have fitting rooms , which is good .
not much else to say !
ca n't go wrong with their buy one , get one free t-shirt section !
and the quad shop is now a jamba juice .
which i 'm not ok with .
it 's even fairly inexpensive to book .
did we really need that jamba juice ?
get your nap on , kids .
great atmosphere-multicultural-wireless-plenty of seating-hotel for guests-lounge-large flatscreen hd tv's-comfortable temperature-restrooms-clean-quiet-outstanding maintenance crew !
they served some of the best comfort food available .
this was _num_ years ago !
busy , busy , busy place .
that place is buzzing with activity and young folks with laptops everywhere .
overall , u of i was a very nice campus .
.
did i mention it was busy ?
only been to the first floor and food court .
kinda everybody 's memory .
the entrance hall is very relaxing with ancient looking clock and couches .
illinois ' union building is okay ...
landmark review :
oh this place brings back so many memories , so many nooks and crannies .

need a quiet space ?
come study in the president 's lounge .
need to have a meeting set up with your other student organization members ?
go up to the second floor in the rso office .
do n't have time to go back home and make lunch ?
the basement 's got a variety of quick bites at your service .
need to checkout some tech goodies that are vital to your studies/work ?
oh , did i mention that this place is also a hotel ?
that 's right !
definitely check it out !
this place looks really classy inside .
the illinois student senate office is located here as well as their meetings .
daily illini - has gotten better recently , but its a crap paper altogether .
the stories are poorly written and usually cite facebook as reference .
wpgu - best radio station in town , but still a bad radio station .
also , the dj 's are inept .
technograph - eh .
the buzz - only reason this is getting _num_ stars .
good local music reviews , and a good crossword .
meh .
i 've experienced better student run publications .
working here was n't the greatest experience + most stories are n't locally relevant .
the tow guy was also super helpful and courteous .
i would avoid this company at all costs !
guess what happened ?
i had to overpay him .
it looked as if someone had used a crowbar to unlock the car .
of course , this was another $ _num_ fix at the subaru dealer .
any sensible human being would have acted differently .
please avoid this company at all costs .
i have had experience with much more helpful companies in the urbana-champaign area .
had a great experience , all things considered .
timely , organized , and polite .
if they tow you , you are pissed .
that said , thanks reynolds .
corrupt business tactics !
my son 's scooter was towed from the front of papa john 's pizza .
this place is absolutely terrible .
on top of that these people are condescending assholes .
do not use these people , they are terrible .
cheapest place i called , and the man on the phone was very polite .
great guy !
but they still serve orange chicken .
it was playing a chinese game show .
of some sort .
this is the best chinese in campus-town .
i recommend the crispy tofu .
one of my favorite chinese joints in college .
the menu has so many varieties of foods .
very inexpensive and i highly recommend it !
i was disappointed with crispy tofu that is not as good as before .
clearly the best chinese restaurant on campus .
we ordered the seafood pho .
my boyfriend was a little annoyed since he had gotten something completely different .
we then asked for srirarcha ( sp ? )
and got a tiny dollop of it .
it was very salty and unpleasant .
i felt disgusted that i actually ate half since i was so hungry .
multiple theories as to why we were treated this way .
_num_ ) a combination of number _num_ and _num_ .
never again stay away from this place ! !
!
the food i would consider a cross between chinese and taiwanese style comfort food .
think oily , but good oily !
come for good food , but do n't expect any service .
i 've never experienced this type of service before - or lack there of .
there was n't a lot of options , only about _num_ items .
my favorite thing for dim sum is shrimp crepes and turnip cake .
both of which were disappointing !
the shrimp crepe only had two small pieces of shrimp .
the turnip cake was just off , seemed like it was n't cooked right .
the shui mai and shrimp dumpling were small , but it tasted fine .
not entirely saddened by this experience because at least it was n't expensive .
around $ _num_ to share _num_ dishes .
when they were under previous management , their food was great .
but now it 's barely passable .
their fried rice is all gummy and their noodle soups are too salty .
prices are n't bad either , about the usual prices for dim sum .
but that 's just a testament to the ownership and the so-so food .
if you want dim sum you can always go to saigon .
i do n't live in champaign anymore but i come back to eat here .
their spicy pig intestine stew is probably the best dish i have ever eaten .
every time i go , i take an order with me .
as long as that dish stays good , i will always come back .
i would pay _num_ dollars for the intestine dish .
i am glad i can still get it for _num_ .
i was pleasantly surprised with this place .
service was n't the best , but it was n't horrifyingly bad either .
it 's always fun to come here with a big group .
) , but cheap .
mandarin wok reminds me of the chinese restaurants back home .
the peking pork was fried to perfection and the sauce was very tasty .
!
in general they were okay .
i 'll break it down list style :
pluses :
cheap .
$ _num_ something for decent lunch portions with steamed or fried rice .
the tea , jasmine or chrysanthemum , is free .
with giant round table w/ lazy susans , this place is perfect for groups .
the tofu , soups , and more traditional dishes looked good .
minuses :
the fried american-style dishes were food-court quality .
my companion found a bug in her food .
the atmosphere is as good as the service -- somewhat non-existent .
_num_ ) sesame rolls - awesome ! ! !
_num_ ) shrimp crepes - pretty good ... i would have liked more shrimp though
_num_ ) congee - this came with a pork sausage which was tasty .
surprise .
surprise .
the pho was excellent .
far exceeding the likes of legitimate vietnamese establishments in the champaign-urbana area .
soup base was flavorful , noodles chewy , meat offering varied and delicious .
and they even bring the bean sprouts , herbs , and jalapeno slices .
you will not be disappointed coming here for a hot steaming bowl of pho .
i took my dad there today to give him some dim-sum experience .
but i am fine with that .
a good experience overall .
went here looking for pho because i was having a huge craving for it .
be wary of when you order though .
but the portions are fairly priced so that 's a plus .
probably one of the most underrated chinese restaurants on campus .
their dim sum is delicious !
not only is it delicious , they have dim sum 11am-3pm every day !
what !
who does that !
it 's amazing !
both were great .
forget rainbow garden - come here for real chinese food .
( and theyre not eternally grumpy like the owners at rainbow ) .
yummy ! ! !
!
crispy tofu and eggplant were the highlights of the night .
ended up being $ _num_ pp ! ! !
what a deal !
this place had generally good reviews , but i had an entirely different experience .
it was a very disappointing .
i had heard from friends that it was great .
we walked in about 12:15 and did not leave until about 2:30 .
in my opinion , that is way too long for an hour lunch break .
we walked in and it was very hectic .
so we sat there and waited , and waited and waited .
_num_ minutes had gone by and nothing .
_num_ minutes .
nothing .
we were very upset because we only had a short lunch break .
about _num_ minutes later , our first dish came out .
slowly , our little dim sum dishes came out .
one by one .
our last dish came about _num_ minutes later from our first dish .
i do not think that i 'll ever be returning .
went here many times with friends while i was down at uofi .
good portions at decent prices .
food is good , only gave _num_ stars because of wait time .
that i figured i 'd eat here just to get the taste .
i ordered har gow , shui mai , shrimp spring rolls and beef balls .
total came to about $ _num_ .
then the shui mai comes out -- - same thing , wow ? ! .
then the spring rolls and beef balls -- yummy , yummy ! !
everything was yummy and fairly fast ! ! !
hooray !
the dim sum here is delicious ! !
i 've eaten here with friends before and was n't too impressed .
definitely recommend the dim sum .
they serve it every day from 11am-3pm !
how have i not reviewed mandarin wok yet ?
the fried tofu is so good here .
if possible , order off the mandarin menu and not the english menu .
definitely better than most places in chicago !
i grew up in taiwan so i know what i 'm talking about .
the regular dinner menu is huge and the food is good .
dishes come out with pretty decent portions .
to me , that 's always a win .
so far the only on campus i know that have dim sum .
not that good but had no other choice .
like their beef stew .
owner lady is extremely nice .
beware of dirty tricks !
i used to eat here frequently .
however , my last two visits were terrible .
they simply served it .
the first time i was not sure .
but apparently they would just keep the overcharge if i had acquiesced .
amazed by the variety of choices .
dim sum is available .
tasty and authentic .
the only concern is the unsanitary look .
the food is all right .
how could a restaurant try to cook all styles of chinese food .
chinese cuisine ai n't american fried shit .
trying to make everything always end up failing at everything .
the food is good though .
alright , i 'm back to not liking the dim sum here ... .
yuck .
i 'll do that next time .
i question the health code standards here ... .
this is a very good place for authentic southern chinese food on campus .
even my parents ( they are chinese ) like this place .
it 's so good and absolutely authentic .
i guess this is predictable because of the inflation and increase in cost .
this is also the only place serving dim sum in champaign as of today .
food was okay , not great but not bad .
i ca n't imagine why this would happen .
the waitress did not even notify me .
i ordered the hot pot and it was n't even a hot pot .
there was no soup ( wtf ) !
the food is oily and lacks flavor .
overall , i feel like i really wasted my money here .
i would give zero star if i could .
this place is a total rip off .
they overcharge you everything and hope you will never notice .
i said sweet .
the owner explained that the sweet soy sauce was an extra $ _num_ .
for a fucking tablespoon of soy sauce !
had i not asked she would never had told me .
second time , my friend wanted to come here .
the owner asked whether i want pork belly or port tenderloin for a dish .
i said belly , and a magical one dollar was added to my bill .
then i specially asked whether the rick comes with dishes or not .
she said yes and secretly added another $ _num_ to my bill .
when i confronted her , she said the rice was $ _num_ per person .
at this point , i was beyond pissed by this dishonest act .
wtf !
hell i will never ever return to this restaurant .
um , it was okay .
came here for dim sum and incomparable to chicago dim sum .
the lady doesnt really act nice to us cause we arent chinese ...
the deep fried taro smells like straight up clorox and i was scared .
dont think ill come back here .
solid restaurant for dim sum and other chinese dishes .
i came with a large party and we ordered quite a bit of food .
all of the classic dim sum dishes were done fairly well .
everything else we ordered was pretty standard fare .
this place is filthy .
the doctor i had was completely negligent in correcting a problem she had created .
this is just a review of the facility .
the christie facility is well-designed , in a good location , and well-staffed .
mtd gets you there easily , too .
they make it ( ahem ) as painless as possible .
you are not alone , after typing that last one i hate myself too .
take care of biz w/ your doc and you 're off .
my primary is here too and no hassles there either .
`` building wealth '' is a frickin pillar of their values .
just an fyi .
i saw dr. samuel-parks at the mahomet location to discuss weight loss medication .
dr. samuel-parks was condescending and dismissive .
i hate them .
i drink my coffee black .
she just assumed i drink _num_ calorie frappes . ) .
she did n't even perform a full physical on me .
this is a horrible place .
even after they have already known you are healthy .
she is so bad that i get anxiety talking to her .
she makes mistakes , she shows her ego , and she does not care .
i pray you do not get her .
my previous review was for carle hospital .
not sure how it showed up here .
please fix .
i am so done with christie clinic .
i will never go here again ! !
they do n't know how to bill correctly !
something i said ?
really ?
another issue i had is for another annual exam .
which was also supposed to be paid _num_ % with no co-pay .
additionally , i had some lab work that came back abnormal .
they did further testing without my consent .
christie clinic uses diagnosis codes for what they are trying to rule out .
better yet , just find a different healthcare facility to go to !
they suck .
for the last year and a half , my experience goes like this .
schedule appointment .
get cancelled and rescheduled 3-5 times .
doc changes my scripts , i call the pharmcy who never got them .
today was the last straw .
avoid going here at any cost !
my experience actually started quite positive .
which they did not do !
very rude and unhelpful staff when it comes to complaints !
just save yourself lots of follow-up problems with billing and go to another place !
they are friendly and professional and dr z .
is very knowledgeable .
i highly recommend he and his staff .
they really get you in & out of there quick !
i did n't even have the chance to describe all of my symptoms !
at least the doctor seemed friendly .
hopefully their quick assessment will yield some solutions .
all time favorite bar on campus !
it 's always extremely rowdy , probably too rowdy for me these days .
drinks .
lots of them .
yes , it 's dirty .
yes , it 's smelly .
hopefully the former before the latter .
college binge drinking at it 's finest .
not that that is necesarrily a good thing .
a must try once kind of bar for me .
had a great time here during the day after a bar scramble .
not so great at night when the typical crowd gets there .
a little on the pale side for me .
just for the location ( across from thetas ) , you get 5stars .
wow ! ''
the vomit smell is even there at like 8am on tuesday mornings !
they 're right - kam 's blows .
it deserves zero stars .
you know how you can pin point freshman when they come to the uiuc ?
bingo !
they 're toting around bright orange illini union bookstore bags .
same goes to the people who wait in line at kam 's .
the majority are freshman .
underage drinkers who ca n't hold their liquor .
screw that .
some drunk guy peed on my foot here .
true story .
i was only eighteen and not proud to be in the bar .
look !
worst .
bar .
ever .
now .
on this night ( tuesday ! )
or maybe that was just me , i can never be sure .
hell , maybe i stole someone else 's beer .
yay kam 's !
kam 's is definitely an under age paradise .
who are you people giving these stupid reviews ? ! ?
!
well , i went back to campus this weekend for the michigan-illinois game .
do they ever mop ? ? ?
ewww .
just get some toilet paper in the ladies room stalls !
this place is a nightmare .
there is nothing redeeming about this place .
the music is really really shit , not even ironic shit but honestly shit .
awful !
if you like puke , and freshmen , and freshmen puking , come here .
the only time i 'm ever here is during a bar crawl .
ever wonder why you ca n't get laid ?
because you are a nerd
are you a sensible , intelligent human being ?
are you older than _num_ ?
does your clothing generally obscure your breasts/underwear/genitals from plain sight ?
are you averse to fist-pumping ?
does the pungent odor of beer-tinged vomit make you nauseous ?
well , then , welcome to kams - your personal hell .
like everyone else said , wasted freshmen , disgusting bathrooms , bad smells .
recently voted as the best place in champaign-urbana to have a one night stand .
if not , one star .
the place stunk .
the drinks were worse and painfully weak .
i was horrified to see people in formal wear .
guess they were pre-gaming it there ?
ladies ... pass this one up .
you can do better !
kams is always filled with student athletes with the throngs of girls surrounding them .
cheap night out .
i will not miss this bar or ever return .
someone needs to mop it every once in awhile .
kam 's is one of the best bars in the world .
the basement is fantastic for parties and the staff is very knowledgeable .
the free popcorn is of gourmet quality .
rarely am i rendered speechless .
however kams did it to me .
these people we met at the football game randomly invited us .
even though my friends warned me , we went anyway .
( obviously i am a beer connoisseur . )
( it was n't terrible . )
the guys were also buying shots , which helped a lot .
i 'd come back again , just for the lulz .
my feet stuck to the floor throughout the entire bar .
the tables probably had n't been cleaned in years .
that 's saying something .
the staff at this place was something else .
kams .
smells like a hamster cage in serious need of a bedding change .
drinks are totally average , albeit cheap .
ok .
the two stars are because the floors had many sticky diseases on it .
wtf ?
do n't they clean the floors ?
that was the only reason it did n't get one star .
i 'd go back if i 'm in champaign again .
just walk by the place and be overwhelmed by the smell .
i 've been in the place once and it is gross .
this is n't just an `` i hate frats '' thing or something either .
i ca n't imagine going to this place at a peak time .
20,000 watts of awesome .
note : this review only applies to august _num_ - may _num_ .
( this review also applies to the lesser-known koms )
this bar stinks ! !
- literally !
this is the stinkiest , slimiest , stickiest bar i 've ever been to .
that about sums up my experience with this staple on-campus venue .
came here _num_ years after my graduation ... and not much has changed .
it still smelled like vomit , stale beer , and service sucked .
worst bar i 've been to , period .
the smell , what is it ?
this bar is the scummiest fucking shithole at uofi .
its littered with garbage vomit and broken glass .
the answer to good for kids should be are you kidding .
went there to party , fun , but the establishment itself sucks .
i ate a hotdog that they grill outside because they smelled great .
regretted that in _num_ hours .
dont go here until someone buys it again its really a piece of shit
what an absolute dump .
everyone who goes to kams is underage .
more likely to see a high schooler in kams than a 21+ individual .
one star is too much .
i have n't been to kams since i went to college .
i went there for the memories .
this was humiliating at best .
kams sucks and we will never go back .
kams is the empyrean of champaign life .
what a mistake .
a pox upon it .
five dollar cover ?
are you joking ?
leading psychologists say that smells ring bells* .
it is tasty and good and sweet to the tongue .
it dulls all the bad senses and electrifies the good ones .
it instills confidence where there was none , and reinvigorates the soul .
one suggestion is to start serving food .
a blue boy sandwich , now that is something .
*https : //www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-babble/201501/smells-ring-bells-how-smell-triggers-memories-and-emotions
frat boy douchebag feel .
early 2000s pop remixes .
there 's a strong smell of vomit throughout the bar .
tis was definitely my favorite bookstore !
it always had all my books , with used and new options .
reserving books online was definitely a time saver .
writing this review is making me miss tis and college ... .
i used to love t.i.s .
bookstore , but lately i am so far from a fan .
t.i.s .
is almost always the cheapest of the three stores .
however , i can usually find all my books for much cheaper on amazon.com .
order the books on amazon or ebay .
definitely the cheapest book store on campus .
oh well .
but cheap when they sell means cheap when they buy back ...
for each dollar you spend , you earn a point .
after earning certain amount of points , you qualify for different prizes .
if ever i need something for a class , i 've always preferred tis .
meh - not great , not horrible , just average .
very strict about certain aspects of buyback .
if you get any gunk on the pages they do n't buy it .
outdated ?
they do n't buy it .
class does n't use it anymore ?
sorry kid , out of luck .
i recommend buying online from amazon prime or abebooks.com first .
i wish i could give _num_ stars .
two days ago i purchased an iclicker here for $ _num_ including tax .
this afternoon i attempted to return the unopened product with the original receipt .
the grocery has staples like plain old salt mixed in with mexican imports .
the produce sections has avocados for all your guacamole-making needs .
the staff was helpful .
yes .
gracias a dios que hay una restaurante semiautentico en champaign !
only offering manzana lift would make things better .
great place , one i 'll be visiting quite often .
the tamales are smallish but yummy .
i also bought some candy and a strawberry boing !
drink and the total was only $ _num_ .
very reasonably priced and worth every bite !
breakfast this great tasting would cost a lot more anywhere else .
boycott chipotle and qdoba !
go to el charro and eat real mexican food .
this place is amazing !
you have not tasted carnitas until you have tried theirs .
ask for a sample , they will give you a little hunk for free .
and even the tongue here is amazing .
make sure you wash it down with a jarrito ... preferably tamarind .
trust these west coast people , they know their stuff !
must get the carnitas on the weekends .
he recommended all these fantastic mexican places for me in chicago .
treat him right and he 'll take really good care of you .
the guac was the best i 've ever had .
even better than my own .
his ingredients are much fresher than what i can get ... no fair .
tons of yummy cilantro .
best place on campus hands down .
as much as i like it , chipotle does n't count .
it 's a pretty easy place to miss .
i tried carnitas , shredded beef , and chorizo tacos .
all of them were quite delicious !
but the food was n't the only impressive part about this establishment .
he really deserves a medal for the effort .
tried this place the first week in c-u .
after having read the reviews , i was expecting more .
the woman at the counter was friendly , but the food was disappointing .
there were flies all over the place .
the produce looked so sad and wilted .
small , inexpensive , and very delicious .
i 'll post a review about them when i try them .
shredded chicken or shredded beef perfectly seasoned .
steam them up for a couple of hours and you will be very happy .
real authentic mexican dishes , right in the middle of c/u .
been here a few times now and everything tried was spectacular .
got spoiled in ca with taco trucks serving scrumptious goodness everywhere .
for being in illinois , nothing else outside of chicago can compare .
the grocery store and food counter are unassuming and homey ( homely ? ) .
everything is super cheap for the quality and quantity .
it 's a non-corporate family venture , the same folks are always working .
if it looks good , and smells tasty ,
just eat !
alejandro is really friendly , and he 's kinda super hot as well .
he 'll help you figure out something to try if you are unsure .
this is the real deal .
perfectly traditional mexican .
tacos w cilantro , onion , and wedge of lime .
divine , yet so simple .
best tacos and tamales in town , also , the best price .
the price is n't too bad at the grocery store at all .
he 's super nice and friendly .
nom nom nom nom nom
this is what happened to the tamales i bought from el charro .
i went here a few months ago and had the tacos al pastor .
omg yummy .
there were no highchairs , just the one nasty , sticky booster seat .
it was `` _num_ five alarm hot sauce '' level .
i could barely eat it .
i was almost crying ... and i 'm not a wuss on hot sauce !
yuck .
no frills , but that 's not what you go here for .
the owner is as friendly as they come .
this little taqueria reminds me of the ones back in chicago .
a hole in the wall but the food definitely makes up for it .
i recommend the lengua with their homemade hot sauce .
i 've kept for a secret long enough .
i always get the tacos with a jarrito .
i 'd walked past this place many , many times before actually going in .
or something like that .
the point is , the food here is really good .
and it 's really cheap , which is a rare but appreciated combination .
everything seems really fresh , and the guy working there is always really friendly .
but do n't let the shadiness scare you away !
so if you like maize , definitely give el charro a chance !
for its size , el charro packs a punch .
i 've formerly only eaten in the restaurant here , which was always tasty .
awesome !
ate here for the second & last time a few days ago .
my wife & i both had 'mexi-belly ' the next day .
i noticed that my container felt oily .
shame 'cus i liked the place .
i hope he reads this & rectifies the problem .
the best carne asada around these parts ! !
steak milanesa sandwich is so good !
the menudo is like grandmas .
the taco and burritos are really good too ! !
purchase beef chorizo from there alos ... and good !
no issues with this little place ! !
great job !
very , very nice owner .
proper tacos .
best place in town for lengua tacos .
i 'm a regular .
i like maize , too , but i prefer el charro .
dollar taco wednesdays !
awesome tacos .
if you want a authentic food this is definitely the place to try .
restaurant review :
i had to even ask if they accepted credit cards , yes they do !
everything in the restaurant was sticky from the menu to table to the floor .
usually that may mean good traditional food .
unfortunately this was not the case .
the chips are straight from a bag and the salsa was quite bland .
i was hungry so i enjoyed my chips still and ate the whole basket .
when my carne asada came it was not what i expected .
why would you put giant pieces of green onion in with the carne asada .
these were not pleasant and bitter tasting .
the carne asada is usually very tender the way it was prepared .
this was again not the case .
very thinly sliced meat that was very chewy .
the problem is that it was thinly sliced so it was quite over cooked .
the refried beans was a soupy mess , but the mexican rice was passable .
did i mention that there was so much oil in the dish ...
seriously ...
pro : none ... .
hidden gem :
_num_ dollar tacos on wednesday
tacky decorations , tacky store at the front , awkward register blocking the door .
i 'm shocked that they have _num_ stars .
i like el charro a lot actually .
maize is a little better but the salsa at el charro is bomb .
the tortilla chips are better here too .
i am a fan of their tacos and rice/beans .
the portion was adequate ( i think they could have used a smaller plate .
the large plate with the portion given made it look very small ! ) .
the tacos i got were carnitas and steak .
it was delicious and flavorful !
the steak was likewise very delicious .
the salsa was so spicy ! !
i loved it , hah .
i would return here for their $ _num_ tacos .
the good : tortilla chips , salsa and flavor of meats .
the bad : portions and service .
they give you a more generous portion .
she was nice but was n't too helpful with questions .
service was a bit slow and waters did not get refilled .
i do n't think i 'll be heading back here .
i 'll just go to the other options .
pros :
_num_ .
tortillas/tacos are delicious !
4/5
_num_ .
salsa and chips are really good.. on the spicy side .
4/5
_num_ .
$ _num_ taco wednesdays
_num_ .
sauces that come with the tacos .
_num_ .
reminds me of king taco in los angeles .
cons :
_num_ .
the ground beef tasted a bit off last time i was here .
_num_ .
chicken was dry and adding salsa did not help .
_num_ .
service can be slow .
takes some time getting things such as water , straw , fork , etc .
or maybe i 'm just a needy customer .
_num_ .
ambiance/music - an ant was crawling on me while eating .
mexican music can get loud .
it 's a small grocery store & eatery .
the tacos always hit the spot .
pozole ( pork & hominy soup ) on the weekends is a special treat .
i like mine with plenty of lime & cilantro .
horchatas are huge & there are refills .
the storefront & the interior are small and not necessarily clean looking .
but the food is fantastic & alejandro is super nice .
there are a few tables/chairs if you want to eat in .
the tv is usually on quite loud .
great food and authentic ambiance .
felt like we were in mexico .
scrambled eggs with chorizo was the bomb !
let me say , i strongly regret this decision .
not a good experience .
spend the extra few dollars and go to maize .
slowest service i 've ever had .
waitress also did not know anything about menu items .
this made it a little difficult to eat because the insides kept falling out .
the steak was like finely chopped up and at times resembled ground beef .
it was also quite greasy .
very underrated place !
got _num_ chicken tacos ... . amazing !
the chips and salsa that was brought out was also phenomenal !
i had a margarita and a mexican shrimp cocktail .
it seemed almost fermented like it was expired .
may have been the result of freezer burn but it also tasted funny .
avoid !
!
the cook and waiters are nice .
the prices are good .
every time i eat here i order carne asada tacos & chips and salsa .
they 're understaffed though .
this place is great .
also the food is cheap ! !
i highly recommend el charro , steak tacos are great .
i recently found this place and have been back multiple times .
specifically on wednesday when they have their dollar tacos special .
the beef , chicken and pastor tacos are each a dollar every wednesday .
they are extremely flavorful .
the beef tacos are n't bad either , but i prefer the pastor tacos .
the chicken tacos were pretty mediocre in taste in my opinion .
delicious .
in town for a day .
had carnitas tacos .
more than worth it .
wow .
salsa also great and friendly staff .
name should be c.o .
daniel 's .
competitor of kam 's , which is right next door .
i love uiuc .
take a friend in case there 's no door .
for one , the name of this bar is `` c.o .
daniel '' - which stands for cochrane on daniel .
it 's a cochrane bar - imagine that .
it is affectionately known as `` c.o .
's '' or `` see ho 's '' .
you will receive free shots from your frat brothers who work there .
you will be approached by a number of unsavory types .
co 's is slightly classier than kam 's and has a slightly older crowd .
they definitely get the job done .
honestly , it 's a typical college bar .
when i was _num_ , i thought this place was the greatest thing ever .
i was pretty stupid when i was _num_ .
when i went in it smelled overpoweringly like barf .
it was so strong i could n't talk , listen or even think .
what did she say ?
this play duckling bucks ?
its pretty loud .
needless to say it was also too crowded , dark and dirty .
i still remember many faces but sadly , very few names .
such was the magic of cos .
enjoy your time there ...
i 'd give anything to have it back !
: - ) lots of choices that are made to order .
my favorite is the chicken cesar pita .
delivery takes a little while , so it 's best to pick up .
it 's open late ... i think until 3ish .
this is my favorite place to eat in champaign-urbana .
i hope they bring one to my home-town !
two thumbs up for the pita pit !
this place is over-rated .
dorcas is one of the best korean restaurant in cu in my opinion .
i love their combos because i always get to try different dishes .
my favorite is their grilled mackerel .
they give you tonnes of food as you can see from the pictures .
update : i retract my last statement .
the hot and spicy squid was really good .
you get very sizeable portions .
great , great food and fast service .
i love this place !
dorcas is a very standard korean restaurant ... that koreans actually go to !
the portions are substantial , soups authentic , and banchan wonderfully served .
the interior is clearly not meant for show , and while you know what ?
it makes the food stand out even better !
go to april 's .
for more details keep reading .
we do n't know them and they were not her friend .
they said they were delivered so they could not give me my money back .
i got *great* customer service here .
nothing on their window , their door , or online to indicate this .
i wasted a trip .
wow .
i could get better flowers at the grocery store .
very disappointing considering their job is flowers and the flowers they have are terrible .
the arrangement was all wonky and out of proportion as well .
wonderful caring customer service .
i ordered on-line an arrangement for my cousin , who is hospitalized with cancer .
phyllis returned my call first thing in the morning .
i was relieved to hear that the beautiful roses would all be present !
my cousin sent me a photo of the floral arrangement and it was beautiful .
slightly different than the website photo but just as nice .
she was delighted .
also the flowers are listed so you know what you are getting .
it is your classic walgreen .
the people working there are very cool and they help y a lot !
i do n't think i will sell my integrity for a _num_ bucks ink .
ridiculous mean ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
!
clean , well lit , it 's a walgreens .
staff was friendly and they had what we needed .
the birthday cake eminems were on sale but they were disappointing at best
grab decent sandwiches and gyros , and enjoy live music if it 's scheduled .
right on campus near the quad .
great greek food including awesome gyros ! !
this place gets busy as lunch because it 's right by the quad !
great gyros and fries .
often crowded , so plan on a wait for food and a table .
go on tuesdays for discount prices .
the gyros were pretty good , but their fries came with this amazing sauce .
i ca n't believe i walked past this place for three years .
at least i have many more tuesdays ahead to take advantage !
the gyros here are decent and they have live music on certain days .
expect to pay a cover for the music .
i love the gyros here .
i love their cucumber sauce even more : )
cool place for lunch on campus ...
their fries are great !
i 'll be back for sure .
one familiar restaurant was zorba 's .
got two med .
gyros , fries , and drinks to go .
when we sat outside on the quad , we upwrapped a tightly rolled gyro .
so eating it outside on a windy day was not a problem at all !
this is where i spend _num_ minutes every tuesday night .
service is fast and it 's not usually too crowded .
nice , tall tables too .
it does have its location going for it , though .
great restaurant !
what to say about it ... service is always great .
the people that work there always seem happy and treat you well .
prices are totally reasonable .
i went almost every tuesday as it was cheaper on tuesday .
the chicken gyro never had that effect for whatever reason .
so good .
never eat here before a test .
you 'll go into a food coma and not do well on your test .
i learned this the hard way .
the very , very hard way .
when i ate meat the gyros were very good too !
i miss this place wish there was one in chicago .
mmmm ... gyro .
they also have killians on tap and a fairly large bottle selection .
zorba 's is probably my favorite green street eatery .
hands down the most underrated place on campus .
i usually eat healthy , well-balanced meals .
however , i occasionally indulge with something less health-friendly .
when i indulge , i go to zorba 's .
a zorba 's gyro is heaven for the tastebuds .
and it was another hit !
chicken gyros and fried mushrooms for dinner hit the spot .
but zorba 's is here to help you with portion control !
i like how they offer their gyros in _num_ different sizes .
oh , and try the cucumber sauce .
ah zorba 's , makes me feel young again .
i frequented this place all the time when i was a student at uofi .
yum their gyros are some of the best .
i like that they have different sizes of gyros .
definitely get the fried mushrooms , you wo n't be disapointed .
pass on the spinach pie though , it 's not very good .
cheap beers .
yum their cucumber sauce is awesome .
they also have a wonderful honey dijon for the chicken gyros .
good food and i love all the dipping sauces .
best gyro i 've had on campus .
not a huge variety of food , though .
i miss you zorba 's !
the food is relatively good .
the fries are the best .
it 's an ok restaurant , check it out !
i 've been happy with both kinds of gyros .
now , i only wish there were a zorba 's in my college town .
fries are good as well , overall great experience .
this is my favorite place to eat on green street .
this place is fantastic .
everything from their gyros to hummus to fries are all on point .
i absolultely love gyros so this is a no-brainer for me .
i feel like this place is a staple of quick , delicious campus food .
not to mention the gyros are bomb .
go if you have n't already !
good ole z-bots as we liked to call this one back in the day .
hasnt changed much cept that now i can drink the beer .
wonder if they will still accept my stamp card from way back .
everything it does , niro 's gyros does both better and cheaper .
so maybe i am not the target audience .
but the thing is , i love gyros !
the ones at zorba 's are comparatively small .
the problem is that the meat is not very good .
it has kind of a gritty texture and an off flavor .
it reminds me of the frozen gyro meat you can get at grocery stores .
decor is old-fashioned as fits a local institution .
there is sort of a grease-haze that hangs in the air .
i will say that zorba 's has great fries - crinkle cut .
zorba 's burned to the ground march _num_ , _num_ .
this was my favorite place to get gyros in town .
but here 's to hoping !
so greasy it burned the fuck down !
currently closed due a fire above them .
i wish them a speedy recovery .
i 'll be back for the holidays and hope they have re-opened by then .
my parents used to come here when they were dating back in the day .
they started taking me and my brother as kids .
the whole family enjoy the food .
it 's the only place my dad will eat fries .
the gyros on the other hand are !
we get the lamb ones .
the food is consistent good and served quickly .
and i love the illini memorabilia .
hopefully , they will still have some to post when they re-open .
parking is an issue as they have no dedicated lot .
otherwise , be very patient with finding parking- especially during lunch time .
awesome place !
great gyros and mushrooms !
zorba 's has re-opened !
brand new interior ( looks nice !
) , and still same great food !
was just there for lunch today , was great to be back !
one word .
disappointed .
i ordered my food and waited to pay .
the cashier left to take orders , and the line started backing up .
the only thing i paid for was the convenience of eating on green st .
all i got was something overpriced and meh .
well , it was pretty much the same as i remembered .
the food is n't bad ; i 've just had better .
well , the sauce here was runny , warm , and almost clear .
welcome back zorbas !
green street did n't feel the same without you since you burned down .
although the ambiance is much improved , my gyro lacked taste .
well bellow average gyros .
soft , tasteless pitas with bland meat and sauce .
not the best i 've ever had , but easily the best in town .
i 'm sorry we waited , the food in the shop is even better !
have only been there once but was a big fan of the gyros .
very tasty
my goto spot in champaign .
great gyros , awesome jerusalem salad !
i 'm so happy they re-opened after the fire .
i 've been a customer for _num_ years
i have gone with the gyros both times and have not been disappointed .
the food is delicious and the prices are very reasonable .
pass up the chains and go to zorba 's .
take it from an illini - you wo n't be disappointed .
zorbas is amazing and an important part of my uiuc experience !
will be missed greatly once i graduate !
a great place for gryos , their cucumber sauce is the best !
my favorite restaurant right around the university .
phenomenal gyros .
i 'd say i still hold zorba 's as the golden standard of gyros .
quick , cheap , delicious .
ca n't get better than that .
i have a gyro or two every time i 'm back in champaign .
everyone should eat more zorba 's !
!
no better place in c-u for a gyros .
this place has always been a favorite of mine .
i 'm so glad they came back after the fire , better than ever .
i especially like that they offer a small size of their gyros sandwich .
they have excellent fries as well .
service is always fast and friendly .
keep up the good work !
zorba 's is still my favorite gyro place of all time .
the food is delicious and they have some pretty unique sauces .
the meat is always tender and flavorful , never dry or bland .
check them out !
i always stop by for a bite when i 'm back in town .
it 's pretty good .
i 'm never unhappy at zorba 's .
a champaign institution , great gyros , with even better service .
definitely a ca n't miss when you are on illinois ' campus .
check their daily specials before you go in some of them are great .
the fact that you can order a small , medium .
yep , it lived up to the hype .
great gyro sandwiches with a cool local feel .
brilliantly seasoned too , the meat is definitely what sets these gyros apart .
i also liked that there are multiple size options for the sandwiches .
the place has a nice , local college hotspot feel .
this is simply one of my favorite spots in town .
they say that consistency is the hallmark of excellence .
i also prefer subbing in onion rings or fried mushrooms for fries .
best gyros in illinois .
fast and delicious .
a campus treasure .
a champaign treasure .
the gyros are authentic and the santiki ( ? )
sauce is second to none .
greek salads are another highlight .
the greek salad was n't anything special either .
i got ta say that i prefer niro 's gyros more .
!
gyros are soooo tasty , i keep coming back for more .
price is okay and service is fast .
seriously try their gyros .
the joint that launched my love affair with the gyro .
their tzatziki sauce is still my favorite , and the chili is delicious .
no bland , thin pita or cucumber sauce here .
did n't know a gyro could achieve the melt in your mouth consistency .
i almost want to binge drink so i can eat here the next day .
good stuff .
the salad does n't have enough cheese !
the store is right on green street and impossible to miss walking by .
inside is pretty cool , open style kitchen and lots of indoor seating .
i decided on a 4oz gyro and mac and cheese bites .
my name was taken and i was called when it was ready .
i dashed home and unwrapped everything , anxious to try it .
i did think that this gyro was really on point though .
the tzatziki was really good , too !
kind of creamy but not too yogurt-y or watered down like some places .
the mac and cheese bites were also surprisingly good .
the only thing i did not like was the portion/price .
i 'll be back to try more !
restaurant review :
there are daily specials which is posted on the sign outside .
today tuesday was dollar off classic gyro or 1/2 price fries .
other than that the combos are about 7-8 dollars a pop .
this is where it falls short .
the fries that come with the combo is a very small portion .
additionally , they are quite stingy with the meat , i.e .
they actually weigh and measure how much gyro meat you are getting .
overall a little disappointing .
i ca n't say the large was very filling for me.. but who knows .
pro : fast service , self service no need to tip
hidden gem :
_num_ .
you can use the belly card to earn points toward free items
_num_ .
daily specials
tuesday- _num_ dollar of gyro and 1/2 price fries , _num_ dollar off veggie sandwiches
wednesday- 1/4 lb beef hot dog , fries , and pepsi _num_ dollars
thursday- bbq pulled pork , fries , pepsi _num_ dollars
friday- fish sandwich , fries , pepsi _num_
not a bad lunch spot .
cool that they do jazz on some nights .
zorba 's has the best gyros , hands-down .
i grew up in champaign and this was a favorite stomping ground !
so glad that they rebuilt ! !
coming back in july , zorba 's !
!
location is great .
wo n't go back
best gyros ( authentic , taste great , and affordable ) on campus .
this place is a u of i must-eat !
tender gyros meat at decent prices .
just stick with a gyros sandwich ( the fries are mediocre ) .
you like gyros ?
you like fresh fries ?
you like green street ?
well , then you 'll love zorbas .
the meat is always juicey and the fries always salty .
perfect for a social lunch or a recovery meal .
love the food at atmosphere .
and they keep that line moving .
they do n't have beer anymore which has helped university productivity .
it 's cafeteria-style seating and the place filled up within a half hour .
we got _num_ of the beef/lamb gyros and a greek salad .
i thought the gyro was okay .
the fries that came with the combination platter were not good at all .
those were mostly left untouched .
this is some incredibly tasty and greasy food .
being able to peruse a bit would have been nice .
even the fries were delicious and i 'm just not a potato fan .
the biggest pro - they have a tzatziki dispenser !
the price is great , you can eat here for just about $ _num_ .
really delicious !
this is a good place to stop by for some quick and tasty food .
it is near campus , which is convenient for students .
i will definitely go back if i 'm ever in the area !
good good fast !
pricing was reasonable .
the bread was great , the hummus was just average .
i really liked my gyro though !
not a big fan .
sometimes they got deals on hook .
did they ask my permission to use it ?
no .
did they credit me with the image ?
also no .
this is incredibly dishonest and ungrateful .
moreover , it 's a sign of pure laziness by the owners .
and yet they did n't .
the food is always nothing short of excellent .
plus the service of course .
it is a staple , and a local landmark .
long live !
i felt too nostalgic here to give this place one star .
i used to come here in the mid _num_ 's as an undergrad .
they should call it more like gyro : fully loaded .
sad .
thus saying there will be zorba 's lunch tomorrow and zorba 's snack .
the fries were just okay .
i 'll say the whole order was standard and expected .
now ... where am i going to put all this food ? ?
?
loved the greek salad and gyro plate .
this is a staple in campus town for good reason .
check them out if you 're in the mood for a gyro .
i have to admit i liked garcia 's pizza .
the interior was nice and roomie and had and interesting set of furniture .
the sauce was very tomato-y .
good pizza , by the slice .
cheap .
i ca n't argue .
i 'd give it a _num_ but must round down .
best pizza in illinois outside of chicago !
it 's all about the crust which has an amazing flavor !
i just get cheese pizza here the crust needs little to dress it up .
i 've in fact driven _num_ miles just to get this pizza .
you just ca n't go wrong with the flying tomato brothers !
garcia 's have the best pizza outside of chicago .
reasonably priced illini gear with a friendly staff .
the items seemed to be decent quality too .
this place is horrible .
the service is very rude .
it was a really weird experience .
well here we go .
te'shurt was the answer to our prayers !
go fightin ' illini and thank you te'shurt !
we will be ordering again soon as all our kids want sweatshirts too !
so i 'm not the target audience here .
but they are one of the few places left to get chief apparel .
chief apparel of any sort is enough to make me a fan .
awesome .
the service i have received from te shurt has been great .
the quality of the custom printed shirts are superior to other printers on campus .
that 's life for ya .
i 'm not sure why i never came here as a student .
we will be back on our next visit on campus !
otherwise , it would be a two star selection .
many people love brunch here , but i found it only ok .
the selection is smaller and the best thing is the donuts with creme fraiche .
mmmm .
cafe luna is lovely at lunch time , with tapas at dinner .
there 's patio seating in nice weather , and an intimate dining room otherwise .
it 's nice to know that you can find fine dining in champaign .
a little surprising considering how great i thought the food was .
the food is mainly tapas ( for dinner at least ...
great dish , i would definitely have it again !
you ca n't really go wrong and indeed it was delicious .
and brought me the most gigantic glass of port i 'd ever seen .
4-1/2 stars .
it is the best tapas place that i have ever experienced .
i really want to drive back down to have it some more ... .
cafe luna would totally pass muster back home in california .
it is a classy , delicious , fine-dining tapas establishment .
or was it ?
: )
i was a big fan of caf luna when it was on campus .
i ate lunch their frequently when i still worked on campus .
the food is great ... read on for more of that later ...
we consider ourselves patient , but this service was very weird .
food .
everything was great value for the price , beautifully presented , fresh and creative .
plan to spend $ 50-75 for two people .
none of the staff seemed at all enthusiastic about serving us .
our assigned server for the evening was helpful and satisfactory but not warm .
the food was all right but way overpriced .
i try not to review negatively on price , but this was pretty egregious .
$ _num_ for six spears of asparagus .
come on guys .
the coconut shrimp and accompanying sauce were excellent .
the duck confit ravioli were also very good .
he did order more bread just to soak up the leftover sauce .
oh well .
well ... luna still falls seriously short for me .
how do you not notice that ?
the food this time also fell short ...
we ordered the shrimp special , which was grilled and came with coconut risotto .
the shrimp was disgustingly over-salted , and the risotto was a pilaf .
how do you screw up your special ?
people ?
the final disaster was the fried gnocchi .
i am a big gnocchi snob , and these were so gross .
i hated it .
sorry luna , after two attempts now , i 'm not coming back .
with that said , i like the lighting .
the silky pillows that match the walls do not work .
my mom thought the artichoke had been frozen .
the sauce , however , was very good without being too fondue-like .
i ended up dipping bread in it .
we also got the beef tenderloin , which was decent .
i thought it was similar to wasabi .
it came with potatoes and onions that were perfectly cooked but plain .
the cilantro-lemongrass pork rib was my favorite next to the goat cheese .
the creamy clams were gross .
the duck confit was a disappointment .
my mom and friend really liked it , though .
oh , i thought the prices were really good .
we got all of that for fifty-five bucks .
cafe luna just needs more polish on their food and better trained waiters .
i hate to say it , but luna is pretty overrated .
we started out with salads that were a bit pricey but absolutely delicious .
as others have noted , the goat cheese balls are fantastic .
the asparagus was flavorful , tender and perfectly cooked .
it had then been soaked in a very bland brine and was extremely waterlogged .
so it was bizarrely dry and soggy a the same time .
what little of it could be eaten was pretty horrible .
the sauce that come with it , however , was really good .
this is the old standby for romantic dinners with my husband .
it 's a wonderful experience going there and it wo n't totally bankrupt you .
their wines are always amazing .
i 'm one of these wine snobs who is also totally ignorant about wine .
?
my initial visual assessment was highly optimistic .
the waitress apologized that they were `` short on menus . ''
but , ok , they were short on menus .
( they also gave us mismatching water glasses .
the menu shortage ( ? ? )
out of tuna .
out of mussels .
by noon on monday !
yuck .
oily salmon leftovers .
hers was only marginally better !
a tomato puree that had cinammon in it , for some reason .
one of our _num_ orders came out wrong .
etc .
etc .
the waitress did n't charge us for the soup .
so , that was nice of her .
not sure who the last reviewers are but here is mine ...
i came to urbana from chicago with my _num_ year old son .
i can say this was absolutely the best experience we had in urbana .
first the atmosphere was charming .
we first sat on the patio and felt like we were really in spain .
as far as the food was concerned , we were very happy !
the french inspiried tapas were awesome .
the seafood was cooked to perfection ; the proportions were perfect .
the wait staff were amazing .
cafe luna changed my mind that night .
here 's what we had :
walnut crusted goat cheese balls - wow were these good .
the cheese was gooey and the bread perfect .
yum
flank steak over potatoes - very tasty .
duck confit ravioli - these were so rich .
probably one of my lesser yums of the night .
they were still ok .
they were not mushy , but not crisp .
the sauce they were served with really came to the rescue .
i could have just eaten a bowl of that sauce .
the prosciutto crostini was good .
we also had salads .
i instead had the house herb dressing salad .
ooo it looked so good and he did n't even give me a bite !
: ) next time , i 'll know what to get .
this time that we went with our friends , the staff was amazing .
enjoy .
however , their new location is n't as great as the old one .
that was it ! !
we ordered some coconut shrimp , and some ravioli with goat cheese and asparagus .
he explained the pricing , the taste , and the overall service .
luna used to be my favorite restaurant when it was on campus .
it has changed .
i mean purple and bloody , too , not just slightly pink .
i have never seen poultry that undercooked in a restaurant before .
ever .
and the cooks could n't even cook it through the second time ?
the person who ordered it touched the meat and said it was quite cool .
they did n't apologize or act like they cared at all .
at the old location , this was my favorite restaurant in town .
great staff , great food , and a cozy location .
now , at the new larger place , they seem a bit stretched .
i 'm back !
long hiatus over , back to yelping .
) .
if nothing else , try their goat-cheese balls .
suuuper rich , but suuuuper yummy .
their duck tapas was really tasty too .
i cheapened the set , haha .
we were seated promptly .
nice , high ceilinged room .
and what the specials were .
while she looked on blankly , we suggested a decanter .
she brought one back and whisked away the first glass .
the wine , once the sediment was gone was good .
there were bread plates on the table but we had to ask for bread .
the food was different and tasty .
anyway , walked it , loved the decor !
then we waited awkwardly for about _num_ more minutes .
the same girl came over and was like , do you have a reservation ?
we decided we were just going to eat and drink at the bar .
we ordered a salad , melting brie pot and lobster & crab stuffed prawns .
well , the salad was pretty good..but how can you mess up salad .
the melting pot brie ... .disappointment !
the potato totally overpowered the brie and you could barely taste it .
so i guess that was a bad selection .
then the `` prawns '' came out ... .well it wasnt prawns at all .
we said fine .
they came out ( four of them ) , not stuffed at all .
however , the staff was super nice and always checking up on us .
okay here 's the deal , i personally think the food is great !
however , the service is so-so .
way too expensive for crap like that .
the waitresses are hit or miss -- sometimes excellent and sometimes moody/incompetent .
had not expected it to be so close to it .
anyway .
on to the review .
the place was very nice .
the bathrooms are awesome .
gray and sleek with lots of mirrors .
one thing : why are the toilets set so close to the ground ?
now to the food !
( and our server . )
wow , first meetings are deceiving .
we do n't offer entrees until dinner time . ''
whoa .
my bad on messing up foodie-language .
excuse me .
oh man , these are to die for .
frothy and refreshing , with chunks of pineapple and a hefty dose of mint .
mmmmm !
i wholeheartedly recommend ) .
so good .
oh man !
and the artichokes were cooked wonderfully .
i justpoked it with my fork and it fell apart .
mmmm .
the french toast - wow .
thick pieces ( so many pieces !
six at the least ! )
my sister 's lox benedict : thumbs up .
i am not a fan of poached egg , but luna did it right .
she had a side of fresh greens with a zippy sauce that was yum .
oh !
i loved this .
really did .
what gives luna the four stars ?
the wait time .
but i will be back to sample the dinnertime tapas !
( and expect a review after then too . )
we love luna !
they also pour generous glasses of wine .
it is such a cute restaurant .
we saw them open this morning and jumped in for brunch .
the food was ok , a bit overpriced but not awful .
like several other reviews here have said , they are just not the same .
this is the best restaurant in c-u .
everything was spot on delicious !
the french horn was good but a little sour for my tastes .
the atmosphere is very quaint .
i am very excited to try their brunch menu sometime .
i thought it was very reasonably priced for everything we had .
i 'd highly recommend cafe luna to anybody !
oh man .
croquette madame and the croque monsieur .
seriously killer .
it 's perfect for a brunch but filling enough for later on too .
i definitely would recommend it anytime you 're in town !
tapas is an awesome concept , and luna does it well .
they always have many small plates to choose from .
food has ranged from mediocre to very good .
great place to take a date .
it is practically the best thing on the menu and never disappoints .
the squash was great , but the prosciutto was really crunchy and tasteless .
overall a solid restaurant .
not nearly as good and has a smaller/weirder selection of tapas .
and bring at least $ 40/person .
maybe i 'm not in the right crowd to enjoy the food .
you ca n't .
the omelets are delicious .
soft oozy egg .
it 's not perfect .
the cinnamon rolls were only ok .
i 've had avocado issues .
a chicago reviewer would say `` there are kinks . ''
i must say however , it 's delicious , and you should totally go .
i have had two experiences at luna cafe , one of which was good .
she brought the table of _num_ four slices of bread .
the dishes were extremely underwhelming , and the first _num_ or _num_ were cold .
one shrimp , or one small slice of cheese .
there is no way these could count as tapas .
they were bites .
needless to say , very disappointing , not worth the hefty price tag .
absolutely delicious .
service was great-especially since it was spring break and it was not crowded .
the tapas were great portions .
tried the walnut goat cheese balls with honey ... divine ! ! !
the mussels in spicy curry were tasteful , not really spicy at all though .
overall an enjoyable dinner .
enjoy the ambiance of luna and there is solid food for the price .
this should be a great restaurant .
but this is not a great restaurant ; it 's a lazy restaurant .
alas for you luna , you are deceived because this is not true anymore .
there are a lot of good places to eat now .
i really used to like how haphazard luna was when it was on campus .
no way .
food was overpriced and low quality .
orders were messed up .
very unorganized .
had to ask for silverware .
_num_ hours for lunch is too long .
the food at luna is quite good and they have a nice bar .
nice ambiance but portions are kinda small .
dear caf luna ,
you had ruined my graduation dinner on may 14th , _num_ .
i had made a reservation at 8p.m .
one customer told us to find the host wearing white with an apron .
then finally after another _num_ minutes , we were being seated .
however , this nightmare did not end then .
and , we were finally allowed to order after _num_ minutes of sitting !
neither the server , nor the host , was attentive and helpful .
the server had this terrible attitude toward us the whole time .
nothing much was explained nor bettered throughout our experience .
and the foods were not the best they could be consider the price .
we could not grasp the understanding of this horrific experience .
was it that we looked foreigner and stupid ?
was it because we were furious having to wait even with a reservation ?
caf luna , you had successfully ruined my graduation celebration .
thank you so much for doing so .
i would never ever go there again .
it was truly a nightmare ,
by : one of your customer who intends to let everyone know about this incident
pros : the beignets were tasty and so was the sandwich .
nice portions as well .
cons :
-i was seated without a menu .
-i ordered the beignets and they forgot to put chocolate sauce on the plate .
i 'll do sunday brunch somewhere else !
cafe luna is outstanding in several areas .
the food preparation is perfect .
dishes are high class .
the ambiance and decor are luxurious , but prices are quite reasonable .
service is competent , but not exceptional .
food :
it is rare for a kitchen to get all of the little things right .
cafe luna 's kitchen gets every little detail right .
my omelet came to me with the eggs slightly loose : perfect .
the filling was sauted mushrooms and a couple of cheeses .
the cheeses were high quality and the mushrooms were freshly sauted .
my companion ordered a quiche , which she enjoyed and which i sampled .
were used , and that the custard was mostly cream .
see the restaurant web site for the full menus for each meal time .
decor and ambiance :
in any case , ceilings are high , as are the windows .
tables and chairs are very comfortable , the latter being upholstered .
service is ok , but not exceptional .
i would guess that service degrades considerably during busy periods .
the horseshoe bar anchors one side of the dining room .
there appears to be a nice outdoor seating area .
on weekends , this area of town would be relatively quiet .
service :
service is competent but not exceptional .
price :
price for value received is outstanding .
even in absolute terms , the prices are on the low side .
other :
there are large public parking lots a block or two away from the restaurant .
summary :
in my one visit to cafe luna , the restaurant was truly outstanding .
i highly recommend cafe luna .
tapas .
we ordered the first seven appetizers on the menu and they were all perfect .
how is that possible ?
all _num_ appetizers perfectly done .
we were not in a michelin star restaurant in new york or la .
this was champaign , illinois- a university town .
food this good merits _num_ stars .
again , i only tried the tapas .
i see no reason why the rest of the menu wo n't impress .
ok- this review has been a long time coming .
i have visited luna four times now and each time is worse than before .
i have gone for lunch multiple times and it always averages two hours b.c .
the service is soooo slow .
now , onto my dinner last night .
classy .
the chef is searching for the pasta . ''
no thank you .
i changed my order to the chicken dijonaise .
it came out looking decent until i took a bite .
there was so much salt on it , i could n't eat it .
this place is so overrated it 's not even funny .
uggggg ... .
ok , so i used to love luna when it was on campus .
love .
it .
first and second , i went with a group for brunch .
my second trip , our group had reservations and we still waited _num_ minutes !
third ( and i 'm afraid final ) visit was a disaster .
this was another large-ish group ( about _num_ ) with reservations .
drink orders were taken but never filled .
our food orders were not taken at the same time ; not even close .
all of this happened while thirsty patrons are still waiting for their first drinks .
i ordered risotto that night .
mistake .
the very delicious-looking fries were sort of like my risotto , cold and wrong .
of course that was all wrong and took another half hour .
it 's so cold , loud and crowded .
disgusting !
i have a few qualms with luna .
we ended up waiting an hour to be seated .
there was no sitting area , just a hallway so it was rather uncomfortable .
when we were finally seated , we had a delicious meal .
+second time i went there was for a date with my boyfriend .
we are both vegetarians and we had no problems finding enough food to eat .
we left full and a little tipsy ( good wine !
) .
there was hardly anyone at the restaurant but we still had terrible service .
they seemed understaffed , apparently due to rehearsal dinner going on simultaneously .
my friend had a very rare steak that took forever to be sent back .
i want to love this place but service is a huge deal for me .
the reviews are all over the place and many of them criticize the service .
in my experience , it was the exact opposite .
the service was perfect .
the tapas themselves are where the place got knocked down to _num_ stars .
the charcuterie platter was edible , but lackluster .
the day we went they had a set menu for $ _num_ a person .
_num_ courses .
without exaggeration , the food was disgusting .
the restaurant looked nice , good atmosphere .
the service was fine .
first course : lox with cream spread and bread and oysters
the salmon tasted like it was two weeks old .
the oysters were the same .
terrible .
second course : coconut shrimp and mixed greens with beets
cheap quality .
i would n't be surprised if it came from some frozen bag at costco .
mixed greens with beets was pretty good .
third course : new york strip steak and lamp chops
i swear on my life this is the worst steak i 've ever had .
the meat was tough and stringy .
it was way over-seasoned .
and it was like _num_ % tough , inedible fat .
i could make a better steak when i was _num_ .
the lamb chops were so tough , we could n't even eat them .
what can i say ?
dessert was the best part of the meal .
and it was still awful .
the pastry was fine .
nice and flaky .
it was impossible to chew .
i understand it was a set menu day and their tapas are better .
however , what self-respecting chef/cook serves food this low-quality to anyone on anyday ?
i enjoy good food , but i 'm definitely no snob .
this was just unacceptable .
omg !
i could n't find it from the actual review page !
here is the review i posted on june 13th , _num_ :
dear caf luna ,
you had ruined my graduation dinner on may 14th , _num_ .
i had made a reservation at 8p.m .
one customer told us to find the host wearing white with an apron .
then finally after another _num_ minutes , we were being seated .
however , this nightmare did not end then .
and , we were finally allowed to order after _num_ minutes of sitting !
neither the server , nor the host , was attentive and helpful .
the server had this terrible attitude toward us the whole time .
nothing much was explained nor bettered throughout our experience .
and the foods were not the best they could be consider the price .
we could not grasp the understanding of this horrific experience .
was it that we looked foreigner and stupid ?
was it because we were furious having to wait even with a reservation ?
caf luna , you had successfully ruined my graduation celebration .
thank you so much for doing so .
i would never ever go there again .
it was truly a nightmare ,
by : one of your customer who intends to let everyone know about this incident
unable to get in to the restaurant we wanted , discovered luna by chance .
every item we ordered was a symphony to our palettes .
will be back !
!
a place gordon ramsay should visit .
yeah , my friend j and i were ready to bolt !
but ...
the service was a bit slow , but it was pretty busy .
the pear beignets were yummy and the coffee was good .
we ordered the croque monsieur and swiss roesti .
they took down my review twice ... ..
it was not offensive at all except stating the facts .
yelp should stop letting the owners easily taking off the reviews ... ...
my favorite place to get brunch in this neck of the woods .
the beignets and eggs benedict are killerrrr .
ok , i am a food snob from los angeles .
we first went to basmati and honestly i thought we were doomed .
there was no flavor and most dishes seemed to be watered down .
this is tame in comparison .
the food is just right and always served fresh and hot .
the semosas are great and served with the best sauces .
this is probably my favorite place to eat in c-u .
i come from boston , the land of _num_ indian restaurants .
however , bombay definitely hits the spot .
my husband is a bit more adventurous and he has never been disappointed .
good luck finding space for more than just _num_ at noon !
it is quite a small place with _num_ or less small tables .
it turned out to be okay although it was n't excellent .
i 'd go for the naan if i were you .
it 's usually the naan that fills me up , not the curry .
updated 5/10/08 :
for lunch , you order your food and pay at the cash register .
a stark difference , eh ?
great food .
waitresses were cute .
i 'd recommend the chicken jalfriesi ( doubt i spelled that right ) .
the naan bread is really good , i 'd pick it over the roti .
the biryani was also very good .
i absolutely think that bombay grill has the best chicken mahkani .
no restaurants in chicago ( even on devon ) can compare !
the manager knew me by my first name , hahahahha that was embarassing .
i love their garlic naan too .
blah .
anyways , a+ for bombay !
this is one of my favorite places in cu .
chicken tikka and lamb curry are my favorites .
with a mango lassi expect to pay around _num_ bucks after tax and tip .
seriously , a bit awkward to have my table wiped down in mid-sentence .
food is always fast and fresh here .
but i 'm not complaining !
this place makes no qualms about itself .
it is a solid punjabi joint , creamy curries , paneer and all .
the staff stare like they have never seen a woman before .
disgusting .
threw out a $ _num_ plate of food after finding hair .
for all intents and purposes , this restaurant is basmati 's all over again .
the decor was exactly the same .
the waiters seemed to be the same too .
well , yes and no .
wait , no , not identical .
the main courses cost about $ _num_ more than on green street .
totally solid , no-frills indian food .
yes , please !
i tried my boyfriend 's lamb saag dish and loved it also .
why is the lunch so affordable ?
this is indian food for poor college students .
bombay has been one of my favorite restaurants in champaign for almost _num_ years .
it 's dark and cozy inside and smells of masala and fresh yogurt .
great selection of vegetarian entrees , too , for those that are into that !
when i 'm there , i go to this place all the time .
what ?
fabulous .
in case that were n't enough , they frequently give me free stuff .
i do n't totally understand why .
i 'm not really a regular , and i 'm not a supermodel .
maybe everybody gets free stuff .
whatever .
i 'm not one to look a gift daal in the mouth .
this place has a great variety of food !
go here for lunch !
the portion is bigger and it 's cheaper .
the naan here is absolutely to die for .
nicely seasoned paneer and enormous naan .
very good and reasonably priced .
i 'd be back once a week or two if i lived on champaign .
great indian food ; spiced well and not americanized..
the naan is fresh and amazing .
the naan is really great too .
i also enjoy the aloo tikki appetizer , as well as the samosas .
this restaurant was good , fine , but i was n't particularly impressed .
ordered vegetable vindaloo .
the naan is very good .
all day and all night my stomach was a bubbling cauldron of curry .
try the vegetable vindaloo- i put it on the menu !
my spouse and i ate lunch there with some friends on 5/30/11 .
the food was okay and plentiful , but the wait service was horrible .
the waiter was extremely unfriendly , discourteous , and unhelpful .
however , after the last outing i will not go back .
it was a very unwelcoming place .
tasty food .
my favorite was always chicken makhani .
i moved away from chambana to the south west .
i miss it .
particular favorite is the saag paneer and spicy chana aloo .
awesome food , friendly staff , great environment .
delicious curry , their _num_ is also amazing .
they have several kinds of _num_ , try the garlic or cheese stuffed !
the food is really good , terrific .
i could hardly read my menu there at night..
i know indian food .
how ?
well , you can use your imagination .
and that it still cheaper than dinner .
pretty ridiculous if you ask me .
i 've eaten at a lot of indian places and i love indian food .
the food was delicious and pretty authentic .
food is not so tasty to admire .
it doesnt have the true authentic indian food taste .
they are smart enough to rob people .
really great indian food , just a few blocks from campus .
no familiar faces ; no liquor license any more ( !
) ; and a totally inept management of the tables .
sub-par indian food , which passes in town .
how is that there is no good indian food in champaign-urbana ?
there are so many amazing korean and chinese places .
the food here is generic and bland .
not worth the money .
i know this because i am one of them .
i walked out with a severe case of food poisoning .
it took my stomach two days to recover from this fiasco .
gross .
this restaurant is a great deal for dinner !
only two negatives , no liquor license and the atmosphere is a bit lacking .
service was fast .
prices are very reasonable .
the food is good by champaign standards and ok by larger market standards .
the naan was nice but just slightly burnt .
this is the best indian food you 'll find in urbana-champaign .
home ! ! ) .
many indian restaurants either are afraid of using spices or carelessly overdo it .
bombay grill nails that aspect , so it gets five stars from me .
we tried weekday buffet last week .
for $ _num_ + tip + tax , it had enough varieties .
their butter chicken and tandoori roast chicken are worth trying .
saag paneer is phenomenal for those interested in vegetarian options .
lunch buffet had probably the best naan i 've tried in many years .
!
so good !
solid indian food !
lunchtime special can not be beat !
we love bombay on green st !
really delicious indian food , ca n't go wrong !
rock solid indian food .
lunch menu is cheaper .
that being said its great .
i just wish it did n't spill out .
my only complaint .
so driver , easy on them turns !
!
the food was awesome , prepared hot .
will certainly visit this place next time on the campus .
i love this place !
the waiters are always attentive and friendly - if not too friendly .
learn from my mistake !
restaurant review
the lunch special seemed enticing for 7+ dollars depending on what you order .
i wish i took a picture of the menu , maybe next time .
the curry was not spicy at all which was perfect .
it was rich and creamy with ample amount of chicken .
the naan was simply the largest naan i have ever seen .
it was perfect with the curry .
you also get a potato pakora .
no salad though as mentioned previously .
pro : large menu with lunch specials , large naan , not too spicy curry
cons : plasticware , slow service
hidden gem :
7+ dollar lunch specials with large naan or rice and potato pakora
food was pretty average .
waitress was pleasant .
i ordered the mixed grill .
it was all chicken .
where was the mix that was on the menu ? ! ?
$ _num_ for grilled chicken and a few grilled onions is not a bargain .
no rice .
burnt naan .
i will return to puran in bloomington : )
maybe not again .
amazing lunch specials !
you and a buddy could get away splitting a dish for $ _num_ .
very cool !
the food is pretty good .
i ordered my food online with my credit card at about 6:30 pm .
i was told that the delivery guy should be picking up soon .
around 9pm , i called again .
this time i was told i had to call delivery.com .
i tried calling , and no one picks up .
around 9:30pm , i get a call from the delivery person .
he said , `` it says you are paying with cash . ''
he says , `` do you have your credit card ? ''
i respond , `` no . ''
mind you , i am in the law building .
my stuff is on the other side of the law building .
i just stood there .
then my hunger snapped me back to my senses .
he walked out unaffected .
the lack of silverware and napkins was a nice touch .
okay indian food .
bit overpriced .
the naan is big and fresh .
the service is sub par .
i ordered an aloo paratha once and the owner brought me a regular paratha .
did you think i did n't know ?
the vindaloo tastes okay .
the lassi is waaayyy too thick .
they do have mango kulfi , which ambar does not .
but _num_ out of _num_ times i would go to ambar .
this place is fantastic for lunch .
service is quick and the staff is friendly .
still , the food is reliable and delicious - check it out !
who works the counter .
and delicious .
_num_ ) their samosas are amazing .
always get them !
worth every calorie .
no hot water or paper towels , dirty , and down a sketchy hallway .
bombay folks , please fix this !
i ordered chicken curry , the meat was spoiled and made me throw out .
will not come here ever again .
really need to reduce prices rather than raising them .
the food is just average indian food , nothing special .
even when you eat in .
the food is n't cheap enough for that .
indian food has been my kryptonite as of late .
friendly folks at the counter .
the food was good !
the naan was gigantic , warm , and quite tasty .
like the other reviews , it seems that overall bombay is a little overpriced .
i love the food in here !
very welcoming !
i didnt finish the lamb biryani , perfect flavoring
the malay masala was good too !
he gave us a naan on the house too
ordered the a spicy chickpea/potato dish with a side of rice and a soda .
rice was stale , cold , and hard .
chickpeas and potatoes were incredibly hard and seem barelt cooked at all .
meal came out to nearly $ _num_ .
definitely not worth you money or time !
incredibly poor food quality .
does n't seem like they put any effort into their food or service .
bombay grill is hands-down my favorite on-campus restaurant .
and hindu . ''
and he had a religious tattoo to show that he meant it .
anyway .
the curry is always creamy and flavorful .
okay , truth time .
i hope not to offend the manager but rather to have my vexation understood .
i got a $ _num_ chicken korma with no chicken .
i substituted paneer .
turns out , i was almost right .
the receipt indeed showed a higher price .
i was purposely trying to stay under $ _num_ .
but that 's not my only source of frustration .
it 's just not knowing what you 're getting and making prices willy nilly .
the food is truly delicious though .
i will still probably come back .
but i 'll ask what it 'll cost before making any substitutions .
food is delicious .
i 'm not entirely sure i know they stay in business .
the ambiance is definitely lacking enough that i take down a star .
i mean , i 'm pretty sure it 's everyone 's favorite .
so good !
on their best days , they 're amazing !
=x
i 've ordered takeout before during lunch hours and was always charge lunch price .
very disappointed by this experience .
generous portions for lunch .
well-seasoned and tasty .
nothing fancy , but very good and affordable .
i had the dinner at this place few months back and it was disappointing .
i had veg assorted appetizer , chicken tikka masala and naan .
veg appetizer was ok , rest was not good .
they were so oily and soggy .
call them potato pakora .
i was hoping samosa will save the day but hell no : ( ..
the filling was bland , the pastry was neither crispy nor flaky .
the only thing tasting good was tea , which was made by me .
that 's it , no more trying indian restaurants in champaign .
they carry a full line of humidores and smoking accessories .
it is a little cramped , but that 's of little consequence .
i just wish they 'd carry some smaller humidors .
you wo n't be disappointed .
i have n't been steered wrong by the staff yet .
excellent discussions ensue over many a bowl of excellent tobacco .
friends frequently bring items to share with others as well .
these fellows go above and beyond .
he always brings his best pipes and they sell them at excellent prices .
[ sorry folks , we are plagued with anti-smoking laws here as well ]
antiques can be found in the estate drawers .
not all of them are low-priced !
be sure to say hi to pat .
he 's fantastic .
[ i have a tobacconist !
lol ] pat 's a gem .
sorry , i could go on and on here- better stop now !
: d
favorite tobacco store in cu for sure .
stuff like that makes me like this place even more !
all seemed satisfied with the selections chosen for me .
the salesperson was very helpful , explaining the subtle nuances of the various cigars .
we talked of smokes , single malt scotch , and their regular smokers .
others in the store joined in .
very cordial atmosphere .
am amazed at the selection of pipes , tobacco , cigars , etc .
feel confident in the suggestions made .
will be a return customer for sure .
a pipe-smokers paradise !
i think the owner said that they have ~60k cigars in stock .
additionally , this is by far the least expensive shop i have been to .
their house blend pipe tobaccos should not be missed either .
they 've got a great selection of cigars and pipes .
many other shops seem to carry pipes as an afterthought .
that 's not the case at jon 's .
they have a huge selection of pipes , and most are priced fairly .
plenty of accessories to round out your shopping experience .
i never felt uncomfortable in the store -- it just adds to the charm .
i dropped a good amount of dough here considering it was my first visit .
this shop is everything that a pipe collector could want .
the shop keepers however , are smug and condescending .
great pipe tobacco and pipe selections , good variety of cigars .
great atmosphere and the owner was very friendly and welcoming .
other than that ... great place to smoke .
when i 'm back in town , i will be back !
i swore by this place in college !
good luck !
most expensive place on campus for notes .
however , cheap copy services ... $ _num_ per page , maybe ?
no one should pay $ _num_ for _num_ pages of paper .
the food is great for lunch .
huge portions , pretty cheap .
drink specials at night are super cheap .
i think they have $ _num_ pitchers every night .
!
you 're a real asshole . ''
but sweet jesus , are they good .
now my cousin works there and hooks me up when i 'm in town .
even so , i still only politely ask for two and fries .
i do n't want anyone to think he 's still an asshole .
: )
these are seriously the best ever .
the breading , the sheer size , the honey mustard dipping sauce - mouth-watering !
i , on the other hand , got the italian beef .
these are the best chicken strips i have ever had .
they are huge !
but the chicken ... oh the chicken .
great pizza on mondays deal !
_num_ for a large pizza with cheese off of eatcu.com
i got a large with half steak and half italian beef .
this is good `` italian '' pizza .
( as italian as they say they are . )
but back to my pizza , it was amazing .
i took _num_ slices and and im not even hungry anymore .
5/5 stars a+
last chicken fingers i had were a little salty and overfried .
plus , they charged me $ _num_ for more sauce .
seriously , how can you win the hearts of your customers with stinginess .
i did n't like this place .
first , the service is slow .
second , the food is not that good .
gyros are below the average and chicken is too greasy !
i do n't wan na talk about fries ...
so , this place is so overrated !
ok , another bad geovanti 's experience , again !
this time i ordered a `` famous '' calzone .
however , the servbice is still sooo slow .
aprrox .
gee ...
thumbs down ! ! !
again ! ! !
unfortunately ! !
!
the chicken fingers are exactly as good as advertised .
they 're the only reason i still order from this place .
other than that , it 's fairly crappy .
i 've had them lose my order before .
i sort of hate the place .
they 're good enough for me to sometimes ignore how bad everything else is .
i 've only ever gotten their chicken fingers combo .
the fries are kind of meh .
really , it 's all about the chicken .
i have to knock them a couple stars because they serve everything in styrofoam .
and because the restaurant does n't have a/c .
you 'll probably want to have them deliver .
ranch would be better .
really ? )
at absolutely unbelievable volumes .
geovanti 's has one of the best chicken strip .
the chicken strips are ginormous !
also get the honey mustard sauce and you 're game !
however the fries are n't that great and lacks flavor .
overall , the service is mediocre .
it 's good when the workers are in a good mood .
it 's bad when the workers are pissed off at some stupid drunk .
happy eating !
they 'll get you on the extra sauce and ketchup .
i would n't really recommend delivery .
it is true , other than the chicken strips this place sucks .
butttt ... .
here are some tips for ordering :
- ordering at night ?
do delivery rather than take out .
delivery is actually relatively good on campus .
- ask for extra crispy .
extra crispy
what i did n't expect was for my order to take _num_ .
i do n't think i will ever return .
i will go back and i urge others to go as well .
best damn chicken fingers i 've ever had .
that is all .
but that 's all .
not much else to it .
so i come .
they 're that big .
you 're almost there geos !
i wonder how many people come in late night stoned with the munchies ... ..
but who can turn down amazing chicken strips ?
yuck .
i can tell you that i will never order from geovanti 's again .
under those conditions , i say go for it .
otherwise , stay away .
this was one of my top places to go on campus .
it 's cheap , the food is delicious and you get extremely large portions .
but the ones they do well ca n't be beat .
the top _num_ things are :
_num_ .
bet you ca n't finish a 5-piece !
_num_ .
gyro - i love their gyro 's !
_num_ .
again , these things are massive so be prepared for leftovers !
_num_ .
_num_ .
so good !
i miss you geovanti 's !
best chicken strips of all time .
done .
yes , you 'll probably regret eating them .
fools .
and that 's about all i have to say about that .
i 've never had the pleasure of a problem-free order from geovanti 's .
wrong orders , forgotten items , and slower-than-the-second-coming-of-christ delivery .
the only thing that kept us coming back was their awesome chicken strips .
so we paid in the store .
done .
cheap , amazing chicken strips .
everything else i 've had here is kind of low quality though .
the pasta sauce has no flavor and the gyros are garbage .
i really do like their chicken strips .
two cheers for geo 's chicken strips .
must eat the night of .
not so tasty the next day unless you put in oven .
order ahead of time if possible .
might take awhile for your call to go through .
honey mustard and bbq sauce .
all day .
i would not recommend the pizza though , .
the actual place is pretty dive .
the bar downstairs is dark and dingy , i would not go there willingly .
dining in is pretty meh , it 's usually hot and sticky .
i love the chicken strips from here .
they have the best ranch dressing that i have ever had !
i will be ordering from them for delivery again .
very happy that these two pieces of gold can be found in lincoln park !
those chicken tenders are a force to be reckon with .
however , the food is always a gamble .
pretty funny overall , the food was great that night , but yeah .
rude staff + amazing food = dinner and a show .
fights with drunk/stupid customers never get old .
illini inn is the last dive bar remaining in campus .
go forth .
chug a beer .
join the mug club .
we 've pretty much given up .
it 's not a two star because i remember the glory days .
maybe , seriously , the funniest thing i have ever seen .
thank you for a memory that never fails to make me smile .
this is no joe 's , legends , or brothers .
most of the bartenders are polite , patient , and fun .
it 's a champaign institution .
mug club _num_
we used to come here after illini hockey games across the street .
too bad it may have gone downhill since .
a dive bar no doubt , but a good one .
the mug club is fun and makes this dive worth the visit .
good stuff .
this is a true neighborhood bar .
quaint , divey , but great atmosphere .
friendly staff , cheap beer ( with some decent varieties on tap ) .
great location- a campus town secret .
going back for at least one beer this weekend before the football game .
a lot of alums with their original mug club cards .
you say dive , i say hell yeah !
there were surprisingly not that many people there on a weekend night .
the ones that were did n't really seem too obnoxious .
the mug club was a must for everybody .
you will see me here again for sure .
best dive on campus .
but the inn is entirely untainted .
but so what , damnt .
the inn feels like a home .
in the end , that 's really all you could ask for .
we do n't go out , we go inn .
just came across mine as i was scanning business cards .
i 'll need to go back and see if they 'll still take it !
hopefully they do n't let anyone else downstairs anymore .
upstairs , you would hear chanting about the need for a mop .
nothing good can come from that .
how does this place stay in business ?
you 're not allowed to browse and he will frequently tell you so .
so i went to g-mart and they ordered it for me instead .
apparently our two kinds of geek do not mesh .
g-mart has a better selection and the employees are helpful and funny .
i totally understand this .
i will explain my _num_ stars though .
overall , go to other realm if convenience is your biggest factor .
if you have a car , go to g-mart .
i really liked other realm .
the owner was funny and gregarious .
so i was needing some comics , man .
i asked if he was open and he led me right in .
that struck me as fair , and definitely do-able .
i have to say i found the shopping experience to be generally unpleasant .
i was in this shop once when i was picking up my girlfriend .
not a _num_ year old undergrad with no money .
i was just killing time and saw this shop .
i look at him like huh ? !
i explain i am kneeling and was n't even reading just looking .
i have n't been treated that bad in a store since i was _num_ .
i mean really when was the last time you dusted dude ?
your little model cars on the wall were filthy .
i came in by myself to pick up dinner for friends .
) .
for fast food sandwiches , i vote subway .
the only benefit of jimmy john 's is that they deliver .
awesome place .
great manners , and really fast .
called from marketplace mall area ...
then she hung up on me without as much as a goodbye .
wow ... no effort to satisfy a customer at all .
turkey sandwich are great here and they make it super quickly .
its much better than subway although that is not saying much nowadays .
so , i ordered jimmy johns .
a little slow but the sandwich was amazing .
i ordered a complicated sandwich and am very happy that it is all correct .
bread tasted great and everything was fresh .
the delivery is fast and consistently good .
online ordering is great .
this if my favorite jj 's in town .
staff always on top of their game .
i usually stop in on my way to work at least once .
i also live about a mile away .
once i ordered for delivery on a _num_ january afternoon .
thats some hardcore s**t right there .
keep it up jj 's !
food is very good and accurate .
staff was all business and bursting with energy .
not very fast .
been _num_ minutes .
normally less than _num_ in phoenix , which is about 30x as large .
when you order they just tell you `` as fast as we can '' .
every jj in any other city tells you x minutes .
disappointed .
i ordered delivery on a sunday night while finishing up some homework .
the online ordering was quite easy .
i really should be less lazy and get the sandwich myself next time .
the billy club was roast beef and ham .
i added almost extra everything including sprouts , hot peppers , oregano and tomato .
they completely omitted the peppers which was disappointing .
after tax , tip and delivery fee my sandwich was over $ _num_ .
granted , this was in _num_ .
but paying $ 9ish before tip is a little steep .
when i finally got it , it was drowned in vinaigrette .
we got a cat here .
they stand a much better chance of being adopted .
i can not believe how awesome this place is .
the place is really clean and the staff are very very very helpful !
i wish all other shelters were like this : x
adopted a _num_ year old cat .
i have a pet adoption application pending .
so i am keeping my fingers crossed .
hopeful i get to come home with a new walkin buddy !
i adopted a dog a few months ago .
she is a _num_ year old border collie lab mix named lily .
she even attacked one recently .
i 'm positive she was abused by her previous family .
cchs did n't take great care of her either .
unprofessional .
rude .
the dogs there are all sad .
my family and i adopted two kittens from the shelter .
i felt like my pets were really cared for before we came along .
the staff are very compassionate and helpful !
they do great work here .
donate or adopt !
not expensive at all .
good lo mein , and more recently they 've added thai entrees .
most dishes are vegetarian .
we can no longer call this place hog ... since they added the thai .
delivery is nice .
tofu pad thai , not so nice .
lacking a few of the standard components .
also super hot , like it cleared out my sinuses hot .
next time i 'll stick to some standard chinese fare .
word of mouth is the only way to go here .
zomg this place is a uiuc mainstay .
it is fairly cheap and you get lots of asian food .
chicken pad thai with no egg ?
game over .
hog wins .
can we say gross ?
it 's not as if i had high expectations ... .
i just wanted something edible for lunch !
literally , i went orange eating it .
sadness .
just bad .
i 've been their twice now and both times i regretted it .
i worked here for a few months ( august until two days ago ) .
location is pretty bad for visibility , even if it 's convenient to campus .
i think that 's pretty sop here in cu , though .
portion sizes are okay .
they definitely shrank in the _num_ months i worked there .
hardly sanitary ) .
i really enjoyed the authentic chinese food i had at lunch here .
the food tasted good and the service was very friendly and helpful .
for the uninitiated , there are basically three menus here .
the best menu is their authentic chinese menu .
this is on the wall to the right as you enter .
the third menu is the menu of thai items .
the place is small , but man the food is amazing ! ! ! !
!
every time ( no joke ) they have messed up my order .
save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else .
sorry .
this is my favorite chinese place down here .
and that 's a good thing for hog .
got ta love this place .
if you have n't visited it yet , you should .
i would not recommend this restaurant .
any food would suffer from sitting for an hour .
the strangest rubbery texture i have yet seen .
vegetarians beware .
okay this place was said to be good .
but it depends on whether if you are a panda express guy .
the place is small and average cleanness .
this is the worst chinese food i have ever had in my entire life .
a total waste of money .
ate here a while ago and did n't really like the food .
read the bad reviews .
knew it was not going to be that great .
decided to go again because i wanted to try something different .
got this chinese fish dish that was just absolutely horrible .
fish fillet floating in grease with absolutely no taste .
i could make something better at home .
avoid at all cost .
why go here when there are much better restaurants around .
on another note , apparently they have hotpots there now ?
i really love chinese food but this place was absolutely horrible .
never go here .
they have the worst food in entire urbana-champaign area .
this place is under new management and is much improved .
huge crowds , but fast takeaway service .
to reiterate what has been said a couple times already , new ownership/management .
the lunch and dinner serving styles are different .
both are extremely good deals .
lunch is served like a school cafeteria with 6-9 entrees offered that alternate daily .
_num_ entrees + a ton of white rice + free drink = $ _num_ .
dinner is fantastic .
variety on the menu is incredible ; over _num_ different dishes offered .
free hot tea .
my favorite dishes : the stir fried green beans are unbelievable .
they chili oil fish is fantastic if you like spicy food and fish .
ma po tofu has a truly authentic mala spicy taste .
the employees are very willing to tweak any dish to any preferred taste .
downsides : small venue so it gets extremely crowded noon-1 and 6-7 .
i look forward to coming back again and ordering off of the dinner menu .
the lunch line moves quickly .
good service other than that .
i love this place .
the name is so quirky too , which is what originally drew me in .
it 's not all made of the batter and sauce like most places .
you actually taste the chicken here .
it is sooo cheap , and you get a mountain of food .
i can never finish all of mine !
the ladies serving are so friendly as well .
the husband and i went here for dinner takeout last night .
wow !
i was super impressed .
i ordered off the `` authentic '' ( ? )
it was delicious .
if you like peppers , that is the dish for you .
in spite of not particularly enjoying peppers i found myself stealing bites .
as other reviews have said , the portions are large and inexpensive .
two people could easily eat here for $ _num_ .
the restaurant is small and it was crowded when we went .
i 'd recommend takeout .
eat here .
eat everything here .
or do n't eat here .
leave .
come back the next day and do it again .
do it the next day .
the next week .
the next month .
go home and think about your life .
go to the gym .
study for an exam .
do everything to not think about the food .
walk drunkenly past and sober up at the sight of it .
then collapse .
wait sleeplessly for dawn .
wait the eternity for the gift from above to get to you .
leave and never be the same again .
do n't be put off by its humble size and decor .
its portions are more than generous .
to top it off the service is always friendly , and super generous .
we are currently making `` i heart hog '' shirts .
this place is serious .
this restaurant is amazing !
i 've never gotten more value as a college student in my life .
this place 's value rivals even mcdonald 's mcchickens .
the hot & spicy chicken was definitely good .
their tofu dish was also very good .
i got rice noodles .
the amount they gave me was jaw dropping .
a lunch special honestly equals about two meals .
oh my goodness , how i love home of gourmet .
and half the lunch box was made up of the rice aforementioned .
i would only come back for the green beans .
but why the hell would i do that ?
great value and very cheap .
good for both american and chinese and always packed during lunch .
hope they have more space .
service is so-so but understandable since they are so busy .
i love hog , i ca n't say that enough .
easily best chinese on campus ( yes , even over cravings ) .
it 's only _num_ cents to add on another entree .
listen , they do n't mess around with the portions .
they give you a lot of food , for so little !
and it 's damn good food too .
this is my strongest preference !
everything i 've gotten here i 've liked .
the dishes are all put together well .
you ca n't go wrong here .
i 've been here again since my first review .
instead of the rice , i got noodles -- much better choice .
i got the green beans which are as good as ever .
i also got the mapo tofu which was good as well .
the chicken was n't totally gross this time !
man , this place is so packed during lunch hours .
in addition , it 's only steamed rice and not fried rice .
i do like the free water bottles that come with your orders though .
i used to go there all the time for a quick and cheap lunch .
note that seating is limited so i would recommend getting takeout .
everything is pretty much pre made and very quick to get .
the staff is very friendly .
i usually get the orange chicken with rice and bok choy .
food is delicious and portions are extremely generous for the price .
the place may look a little janky but defintely worth stopping by .
they also have a wide variety to choose from .
never tried their entrees but the platters that you pick from are always delicious .
great thai restaurant on campus .
they have good portions and a great menu of your basic thai dishes .
they have different chefs so it tastes a little different each time .
i love the pad se ewe and pad thai .
inexpensive and great place for thai .
highly recommended .
this place is very affordable and is a favorite among uiuc students .
however , the food is practically tasteless .
this , i have to say is a major disappointed .
avoid at all cost .
ugh ... or should i say : eww ...
i was trying to find a place to have dinner tonight .
a quick look at the menu : it looks pretty standard .
and walk in .
pretty safe selection , one would think .
the spring rolls were okay , i suppose , though really not that great .
the problem was really with the basil chicken : it was honestly quite gross .
first , why do they use ground chicken ?
that 's just wrong .
ground chicken is wrong .
and the dish was just not good .
i ate a little bit of it and was done .
for the next half hour i had a gross taste in my mouth .
eww .
lesson learned : even thai food is n't always a safe choice .
the latter ( basil thai ) is by far the worst .
wtf ?
in summary , two words : stay away .
good , cheap thai food .
the red and green curry is also awesome .
if they delivered ... i would have lived on this stuff in college .
ugh .
a curry dish with barely any veggies ?
no , potatoes do not count .
they 're not green .
curry is hard to mess up because it has such strong flavor .
however , given a choice , why go and have bad food ?
great place for a quick bite .
the mango sticky rice was terrific .
their service is quick and relatively inexpensive .
however , there are better sit-down thai restaurants in town .
i usually order both because i need my fix when i 'm home .
i would eat here about _num_ times/week when i was in business school .
i miss basil thai : (
doug , doug and more doug !
the best of the best for massage therapy .
great for relaxation , and unbeatable for injury/soreness treatment and prevention .
he his the ultimate healer .
really nice massage practice covering champaign/urbana/savoy .
the arc location offers student discounts , too !
kim moore is fantastic , as are the other staff i 've worked with .
strongly recommend .
it was okay .
a good massage but i was n't impressed .
it was a little hot in the room .
i asked a deep tissue and got just a regular massage .
highly recommended !
nothing but bad service here .
the car was not ready when i arrived .
i 'm done with enterprise for good .
this place is awesome .
i had a great experience here and would recommend to anyone needing a car .
but how is that possible if i rented from them so many times already ?
he would n't help me out in anyway and was just a terrible employee .
bad customer service .
they are nice .
this location -- -nope .
trust me !
we were very satisfied with our vehicle and experience all throughout the trip .
!
never renting with them again ...
i do not recommend it !
i would say steer clear of these landlords .
by far the worst service i have ever had in my life .
i did n't even know that was possible .
words can not explain how greatly i regret giving ppm my money .
do not rent from ppm .
oh god , where do i start ?
be warned , this company will absolutely nickel and dime you .
ppm is one of the leaders in this area .
stay away !
staff is rude , inconsiderate .
staff is not friendly .
professional ?
this company 's name is a joke .
i have lived in la , chicago , nyc for many years .
but that 's not the worst part .
they wo n't tell you unless you ask ) .
why not appeal to god directly ?
say they are doing it for jesus ?
its either rick 's on springfield or drive to b m'f'n naperville .
so , the work is quality and they do not gouge you .
you probably should look into it if you want to save some scrill .
you could do much worse than rick 's .
rick 's has always been good to me , extremely fair and competent .
they are uber-honest , and way more affordable and quicker than a dealer .
they 've handled everything from my toyota mini-van to my porsche .
my car is a range rover .
although the price is a little bit high , they are the best .
they know my car and can solve the problem exactly .
best in town for europe cars .
rick himself is a very down to earth guy , and very skilled .
they seem fair , honest , and able .
rick and his team did a great job in fixing my bmw convertible .
my car battery died and the hardtop convertible roof was in the trunk .
the car was n't starting when one tried to jump it as well .
overall a complicated situation which rick and his team handled really well .
fastest oil change ever .
i have been going by millage since i started driving .
i never drive 3,000 miles in _num_ months .
i will not be returning to this location for anything .
would you like to do that today ? ''
when they can clearly see that my car is 15,000 miles from that benchmark .
why would i get a service that is n't recommended ?
their approach to customer service is bizarre .
i cant say thats ever happened to me before so i was very pleased .
the service was fast too and they vacuumed my car .
there 's a _num_ dollar coupon on their website too .
i go here for an oil change .
they are super fast and friendly !
they stopped the upsell after that .
then , i started having performance problems with my tires .
the tires only had 30k miles on them and they were 60k tires .
i know they can wear early , but that is really early .
they became unbalanced during pothole season .
they had to be replaced .
that explains my poor performance !
but , jiffy lube lost me as a customer .
pretty efficient and recommend their early bird specials
2/21/2015
i stopped by to get my oil changed on my way home .
i will most definitely be returning for my next oil change .
!
worse place in town !
when i complained the guy shrugged his shoulders and said sorry .
having asthma his `` sorry '' was n't good enough .
very very rude staff !
i come here every time i need a oil change .
i never have any problems with them .
the staff is very friendly .
they get the job done fast and well .
there is n't much more i could ask for .
i would definitely recommend this jiffy lube over anywhere else .
so fast ! !
they go over all the recommendations so its easy to understand .
plus they had the stuff that my chevy needed right then and there .
they had the doors open so it was nice to be in the lobby .
i brought bills to pay while i waited and could n't even finish .
highly recommend .
i always go here for an oil change .
every single one of them stopped to wave back and smile to my son .
fabulous customer service .
they filled it up just to let me get home .
i was surprised to read the reviews on smoking/having a smokey car..
i have never had this problem .
now you 're looking at luke warm veggies with semi-warm meat .
it just takes too dang long to get the entire meal on your plate .
wow , get way to start & end a meal .
i really considered buying a drink just to throw it at them .
either way , the food is eh for 20+ dollars .
for a one time experience , i say it 's worth it .
the food however , was underwhelming .
what was ordered :
bento lunch box , teryaki chicken and sushi :
spicy tuna was terrible .
the taste was lacking and the rice seemed a bit stale .
best item on the menu : iced tea .
do n't waste your time .
the price may be decent , but the food lacks the same feeling .
the food was tasty , and was presented very nicely .
we had a couple rolls , fried tempura appetizer , and gyoza .
we enjoyed it .
there were some downsides .
the price was very high compared to the amount of food we received .
also , we waited a very long time for our food .
it 's worth trying .
champaign has a few places that purport to sell japanese food .
ko-fusion and a few chiefly korean restaurants come to mind .
yet kamakura 's elegant interior stands in stark contrast to the dusty cornfields outdoors .
first of all this is not one of my favorite types of foods .
we went for lunch and i ordered the chicken teriyaki box thing .
it was n't bad but it certainly was n't good either .
the portions are really small which really did n't bother me .
the salad came in the upper left square of the box .
it was about a _num_ inch by _num_ inch square .
what really cracked me up was the vegetables .
i think this place deserves a _num_ star .
ive been here about _num_ times .
i really have a mixed feeling about this place .
there was one thing i did n't like ; fried salmon roll .
the breading was thick and greasy .
otherwise , food was good .
i love this place .
it looks nice and very clean on the inside .
i had the sukiyaki and my girl had the beef teriyaki .
both of them were really good , especially hers .
we have been dining here since _num_ .
quality is way above average and they honor their reservations .
( and i am not exaggerating , that was what she told us . )
the food was horrible .
and the service was the worst thing at this place .
outstanding food .
oustanding service .
favorites :
teppan table with steak/chicken combo .
miso or clear soup ( tip : add pepper if you like )
house dressing - to die for ... mmmmm the best dressing
sauteed mushrooms !
treat yourself ! ! !
take a date !
have a brew !
as far as i remember , this place is pretty good .
a pretty unique restaurant for champaign .
never had sushi here
kamakura consistently serves good food .
love their sushi and tapan .
i stopped by at least once when i travel to u-c .
we came here to celebrate a birthday .
it was a cold weekday night and the restaurant was pretty empty .
i was very wrong .
we started out with an appetizer of tempura shrimp which was excellent and tasty .
i had the miso soup and it was spot on - goooood .
oh heavens , it was so good .
until now , i thought good sushi in champaign was wishful thinking .
ugh .
this place is always packed for reasons i ca n't quite grasp .
the parking lot looks crowded every time i drive by .
i only have one thing to say about the service here .
good news : we were seated immediately .
the food ?
blegh .
instead , i received garbage that smelled and tasted like rotting fish .
when i got home , i tried to purge my mouth with listerine .
my suggestion ?
this is the kind of place that gives sushi a bad reputation .
menu presents typical appetizers individual cuts rolls bento boxes and dinners , again typical .
service , mediocre , collage or high school fumbling job .
i have eaten here a few times , depite the poor reviews .
i thought that the sushi was very good .
i enjoyed the sushi rolls and sashimi .
the rolls were a good size and very fresh .
place is relatively nice .
went on a tuesday night , no crowd at all .
i mostly got sushi rolls , and those were quite excellent .
nice , quiet ambience .
little to no loud conversation , soothing atmosphere .
maybe best for couples or business dates .
would not recommend families .
delicious sushi , though !
i recommend the rainbow roll , fantastic .
aw , poor kamakura , why all the hate ?
we still stop in most every time i visit , usually for the teppan .
still , they do well .
!
the food was not bad ... not stand out either .
one thing that really bothered me though was the sticky floors .
worst japanese food in town !
the food tastes the way a public bathroom smells .
i think they raid dumpsters for their ingredients .
go there instead : - )
took my family to kamakura to celebrate my wife 's birthday .
our food was very tasty , our chef was very personable and entertaining .
we had a great meal and i 'm looking forward to going back .
highly recommended !
i have frequented miko 's , but a meal at kamakura has converted me .
the sushi is fresh tasting and just delicious .
but still worth a try .
for the champaign area this is as good as it gets .
i go for the sushi and i have never been disappointed .
the fish is the highest quality you can get in the area .
sushi is all about the rice and kamakura has the best in town .
the food is great and seasoned appropriately .
the service is also great .
also the manager checked on our table to make sure everything was going great .
overall this is the best japanese restaurant in town .
it 's cheap for what you get .
great sushi and teppanyaki .
the service is friendly and warming .
i 've tried kofusion , sushi kame , and yellowfin .
the teppan is great as well .
each chef has a unique personality and cooking style .
it makes going more often enjoyable and different everytime .
this is the only japanese restaurant owned by a japanese family .
i would suggest this place to anyone .
the 'open ' sign was on and clearly blinking 'open ' .
we asked to be seated at the grill .
we were refused service and told they were getting ready to close .
i can not image turning away business in a poor economy .
i will never go back .
i did n't get to try the sushi but it sure looked good .
i had a bento box meal , teriyaki chicken , it was yummy .
seasoned really well .
i nice touch is they willing split the bill .
would totally recommend it .
the sushi at kamakura is good .
it was strange and somewhat offensive .
i have n't been and wo n't be back .
.
yum !
it will be sure to make everyone happy !
you leave feeling so full !
do n't forget to get some green tea ice cream for dessert : )
came here for my friend 's birthday .
i heard great things about this place so i had high expectations .
needless to say , i was a bit disappointed .
the pros : the hibachi chef was very entertaining and friendly .
overall , the food was decent , service was not great ... not impressed
i came here after graduating back in may and my experience was pretty lackluster .
the problem with this place is the service .
went with a friend and got a bento box ( salmon teriyaki ) .
food was good , but the place is a bit far from campus .
welcome to restaurant hell , courtesy of kamakura .
going there with girl .
minutes go by .
many .
after almost an hour , talking to the waiter .
more time passes by .
finally my lunch box comes in .
close to inedible .
the sarku chicken ( cheap fast-food ! )
in market place mall is many many degrees of magnitude better .
how about the sushi we ask ?
`` your order had a lot of complications ( ! ) .
no kidding ?
not , apparently .
to go .
we actually had to leave , i had an appointment .
) , just the traces of the skin of the soft shell crab .
overpriced , mediocre sushi restaurant that only knows how to sell atmosphere and presentation .
you really are better off buying sushi at schnuks .
there are much better places in the nearby area .
it was very pretty , neat , and tidy inside .
i particularly liked the booths with glass tables .
it complimented the shades of blues on the booths .
it helped to show a little bit of culture .
their menus were detailed which helped a lot especially on their drinks menu .
although i did eye the japanese dish menus , i was set on sushi .
we ended up waiting over an hour for the sushi .
they were short staffed .
only one waiter was going around taking orders and delivering the food .
my friend got miso soup , eel roll , and tempura salmon roll .
i got a spicy scallop roll , philadelphia roll , and spicy salmon roll .
the miso was a bit salty .
the eel roll was tasty .
the tempura salmon roll was really cute .
it looked like little tofu squares .
i made a mistake by eating that first .
i thought that the pieces of fish in the sushi were a good size .
if i come back , i would try
i did enjoy the dcor and small twists on the rolls though .
i think this place is one of the better sushi places in champaign-urbana .
first off , there was no wait .
i did seem to take a little too long for my food .
i ordered unagi , ummm , it melted in my mouth ! ! ! !
not every place has this good of unagi !
the ahi was good and the spider roll as well .
i will go back .
quality is what kamakura presented .
this place officially became my go-to birthday dinner _num_ years ago .
the sign is n't flashy , but this place is definitely worth noticing .
) .
there is only _num_ teppanyaki grills and at least _num_ chefs .
this is not benihana .
i repeat , this is not benihana .
this is a nicer place .
japanese food in central illinois ?
their major foible is the fact that their food never truly gets you stuffed .
this place does neither .
i clearly asked for no onions on any of my order ...
but they put onions on every aspect of my bento box .
my below average bento box cost a total of $ _num_ too .
the price is n't worth it for the quality or quantity .
what else can i say ?
i 'm going back soon .
had a great experience .
adam was our teppan chef and he was amazing .
very entertaining and hilarious .
food was deliciously seasoned and cooked to perfection .
i left feeling satisfyingly full and in good spirits .
i will continue to dine here .
on a saturday evening , we waited _num_ minutes without anyone taking our orders .
waited another _num_ minutes , still no one to take our order .
so we walked out .
not enough waiters , the chef has to come out to serve by himself .
bad management , ca n't hold a dinner service on a saturday night .
everyone in the restaurant was waiting for his or her food .
this was on saturday .
7:35pm arrived and got seated immediately
7:50pm got our waters and `` a server will be with you shortly ''
7:51-7:59pm tried to understand what the word `` shortly '' meant
8pm walked out
we went to sushi kame and we received way more attentive service .
i might visit kamakura again `` shortly '' .
went to lunch there today and it was awesome as usual .
staff is so friendly .
we always sit at the sushi bar .
i love the salad with house dressing !
i 've never had a bad meal there !
my friend and i went there and order ramen .
the service is very slow .
the ramen is so bad .
hard to eat .
i will never order it again
this place is a joke !
never coming here again !
first time my wife and i came here the service was awful !
we saw our waiter twice the entire time we were there .
one to take our order and two to give us our food !
we had to hunt the waiter down to get our check !
went again the 2nd time hoping the service was better ... ..nope !
same awful service .
we could all smell trash while sitting there .
first to be seated last to be served !
so sad !
we ordered drinks and the glass was filled half way ! !
we arrived at 5pm and we left at 7pm .
this place sucks ! ! !
!
the bad :
horrible service !
waiters and waitresses who do n't care
drinks filled half glass
hibachi food tasted burnt
one bathroom stall
trash smelling atmosphere
the good :
sushi
food was good , tristan was a fine chef .
tried to take my wife for a birthday dinner .
called for a reservation at 8pm and did n't get seated until 9:15pm .
take your chances on a saturday night !
we decided to go elsewhere .
adam at the teppan table was fantastic .
request him ; you will not be dissapointed !
everything was really good .
very good choices .
i would defiantly get thier house dressing .
on a down note , our waitress was kind of slow .
i think she might have been busy and been given too many tables .
i ca n't wait to go back .
-reservations are suggested .
i *love* this store .
pros :
-the staff was very friendly and tried to be helpful .
-prices are decent , but not always affordable .
cons :
-they have no return policy .
that 's pretty crappy , especially for a store that offers some pricy items .
this is my biggest problem with the store by far .
-they run out of a lot of stuff close to halloween .
-they did n't have a lot of what i was looking for .
also wanted purple gloves , which they did n't have either .
so do n't go looking for something two specific or you may be disappointed .
dude , this place is awesome .
there 's also some rentals if you need something last minute .
no matter what , the staff is super helpful .
there 's also , of course , a whole magic section .
very impressed !
i would imagine there is nothing else like it in downstate illinois .
my _num_ year old loves to check out all the costumes .
cheap fun .
the staff is super nice and do n't mind her trying things on .
we usually do n't buy much .
maybe just some little cheap necklaces or bouncy balls .
i have gotten a couple birthday gifts there .
good source for little kids ' party favors .
maybe i 'll save it for christmas .
so i went with it .
the exam seemed quick but thorough .
and needless to say , i do n't have that problem anymore .
my glasses were ready in an hour .
they seemed to have a pretty decent selection of designer frames .
so yeah , i 'd definitely go back .
maybe i will for those armani frames .
ca n't beat the location if you 're a student .
i went in here for a regular annual eye-exam .
will be going back next year .
i was recently at this location and the staff there was friendly and courteous .
they helped me in all aspects of getting my glasses .
i was impressed with the knowledge and experience they have .
i highly recommend this eye care place .
the staff was very friendly , especially dr. sanders .
definitely a great experience and i would highly recommend this place .
my appointment was for glasses .
their frames selection is very limited in terms of economic pricing .
most of the frames were name brand super expensive .
she charged me an extra $ _num_ for that .
i felt completely lied to and robbed .
so i go back to get it adjusted .
after i left , i noticed that there were scratch marks on the metal !
i went to another store and they adjusted my glasses by warming them up .
did illini eye not have the capabilities to do that ?
?
quick service .
friendly for the most part .
doctor ( i think johnson ) is very knowledgeable and explains everything quite well .
dr. sanders is excellent .
i really appreciated that .
dr. sanders and her whole staff are prompt & go above and beyond .
definitely recommend .
she is very knowledgeable and willing to help me out .
dr. sanders helped me with the rest of the eye exams .
this place is deceiving .
maybe because they did n't want to do business with me .
i spent m it was such bad luck that i went to the location .
i wish i never had known about the place .
this was bothersome , as i prefer how i look in contacts .
) .
i thought it was just another attrition that comes with the aging process .
this tactic worked brilliantly for me with regard to contact lenses .
( ha- loved this ! )
: )
) , and it 's appreciated !
would highly recommend - will be back for my next exam !
: )
very disappointed with the lack of skills/knowledge at illini eye care .
wow .
this is like the original seaboat x _num_ .
it 's well ventilated , there 's seating , and there 's a tv .
the food is still awesome .
just in a far better facility .
if this becomes super successful , they should redo the market location .
i 'm just jealous that this came around long after i left the area .
i had a fish sandwich combo here , and i was pretty unimpressed .
it did n't have a lot of flavor .
their okra was good , though .
seaboat is the best fried southern food around .
the wait is long , but the food is definitely worth it !
i have been there twice and both times i have not been that impressed .
i will say the okra is really good and so were the green beans .
but the fried chicken was not that good .
it was really dry .
the fish is n't anything special either .
when i walked in it was not a welcoming atmosphere .
they acted like i was bothering them and i felt rushed to order .
maybe it 's because i am not a regular .
i do n't think i will give this place a third chance .
a few favorite things are great here .
the best strategy is to call ahead .
i always call ahead .
what we 've ordered over two visits :
sides : fries ( a bit undercooked , but decent ) .
i wish they would note this on the menu .
fyi : the fish is served on wheat buns .
i wish they had better bread .
i would n't rec .
good fried fish !
the prices are excellent and the variety on the menu is outstanding .
she 's the expert and her word is gospel .
i was told that the main place in chambana is seaboat .
my bad .
i 'll have to be a bit more timely !
instead of fries , i got greens .
that 's my personal preference .
the flavor was right .
i 'm a crust person and i thought it had good flavor as well .
the service was very friendly as well .
i want to come back and try the fried chicken !
`` hurry up and wait '' should be the motto of seaboat .
we were so aggravated we really wanted to leave or ask for a refund .
once we finally tasted the food we were glad we did n't .
accompanying sides of fried okra and mac n cheese were on spot .
just love their fried fish , either in a dinner or a sandwich .
good tartar sauce but not enough given .
fries are good .
my favorite side is their slaw .
there is pineapple in it and it just hits the spot .
always have a piece of sweet potato pie for dessert .
i 'll have to try some of the other menu offerings .
price is reasonable .
seating for dining in and the place is very clean .
definitely recommend .
it 's very clean inside and the service is friendly .
prices are n't super-cheap but the quality is very good .
i like their seaboat fish sandwich , and their fries are thick and delicious .
additional sides are quite pricey for the small quantity you get .
better to stick with the combos and skip the a la carte items .
if you do , you can eat here for under ten bucks .
free refills on drinks if you 're dining in .
i recommend seaboat !
the chicken was n't the best i 've had , but still pretty good .
everything was perfectly fried and included _num_ sides and a roll .
hmm , but that 's not it .
we also got an order of catfish nuggets ( $ _num_ ) .
wow .
now those were goooood .
i had the fish and chips with either whiting or walleye .
the menus were confusing - wall menu said walleye and printed menu said whiting .
fries were average , could have been crispier .
potato salad was of the finely chopped creamy variety .
it reminded me a bit of a waldorf salad but was refreshing .
my companion had two pieces of fried chicken and declared it good .
we were there when the place was n't busy .
we waited for our order , but not long considering .
i agree - better than heat lamps and microwaves any day .
small tables in the dining area were covered in sticky none-too-clean plastic tablecloths .
we ordered take-out and went across the street to hessel park .
this is a qualified _num_ stars .
the service here can be quite bad .
but .
their fried chicken is to die for .
hot , well seasoned , crispy .
someday hopefully i 'll have their catfish .
their sides are also generally pretty good , with a ton of variety .
finally , finish it off with some sweet potato pie which is excellent .
there 's not much i can actually say about it .
the catfish was good , but just good .
the roll was unnecessary , green beans were decent/standard , fries were alright .
overall , the meal was meh .
definitely not something i 'd ever actually crave for .
a fish sandwich will take maybe 10-15 minutes , but they are tops .
if you have room , get some sweet potato pie .
it is great .
i have never tried it , but one can order online as well .
great place , esp .
if staying in one of the hotels near assembly hall or the stadium .
highly recommended !
the fried fish , though , is fantastic .
the seaboat sandwhich is great .
the wait is pretty long , so just be sure to call ahead .
it was neither .
decent fish .
online menu is vague .
mac and cheese is awesome but small portions .
biggest complaint is drive thru window ... beyond slow , give yourself _num_ minutes
wow .
simple , almost fast food soul .
good food , fried fish , fried chicken .
did not have the collards or okra .
i am just not that soulful .
fast friendly service .
the seaboat sandwich is the best fish sandwich i 've ever had .
i love the okra and the collard greens .
however their customer service is the worst .
i 've eaten just about all of the fish and chicken entrees , delicious !
ok. that 's the price you pay for deliciousness .
it was good food but a little too greasy for my taste .
i placed our order for take out and sat down and wait .
the food was just sitting on the counter .
what the f ?
i will not come back to this place ever again .
go to windy city express if you want good food and timely service !
the catfish is fire !
one of the owner seasons all the meat .
it is well done and worth the wait .
southern food at a nice price .
i also like seaboat because there are many non-pork options .
orders take a little while so it 's best to call ahead .
delicious food !
well worth the wait .
i love this place !
tastes like my grandma 's cooking .
a little pricey but the quality of food is really good .
went here , was n't aware of what time they close .
when we pulled up the neon sign was lit up and said open .
the door was unlocked .
so we went in and wasted _num_ min .
if i could give _num_ stars i would , or maybe even negative stars .
the food is great .
the wait is insane .
for three meals .
are they catching the fish ? !
well do n't i feel special .
the food here is great .
the driver was unable to find my house and called twice for directions .
so sad .
this is the kind of restaurant i could eat at everyday .
i went fried catfish fillets , fried okra , and collards .
fish and chicken cooked to order , so definitely be ready to wait .
it looks like you can call ahead too .
just rude .
would not recommend this restaurant ! !
mistakes happen , as a restaurant your goal is to make the customer happy .
very good seaboat sandwich .
not very fast but the food is fresh and tasty .
easy to park .
interesting little place .
got ta try it at least once .
i love their coleslaw .
good , simple , soul food cooking .
the food is very good , but your wait may be longer than stated .
**closed**
so sad but the seaboat has sailed away .
the seaboat is now permanently closed .
this champaign landmark was in business for _num_ years .
it will be missed .
good bye seaboat , jr .
good bye catfish nuggets .
also so long to the staff , you were like family .
this time , we had a really nice friendly waitress .
the champaign olive garden has declined significantly within the last year .
this is what i wrote about it at the time :
it seemed a little nicer than your t.g.i .
fridays and your applebee 's .
well , it 's not like that anymore .
not the one in c-u anyway .
i do n't think i will be going back there ever again .
it was disgusting .
the textures were waxy and the cheese was lardlike .
while the flavors were bold , they tasted man-made and had a processed mouth-feel .
it was to real food what velveeta is to real cheese .
in truth , the food quality is comparable to a fast food restaurant .
i know it 's just olive garden .
i know it 's an evil chain restaurant and a glorified mcdonalds .
i guess the thing is that it did n't used to be this way .
i think i 've heard that they are under new management .
but now it 's not .
the seams are showing .
quality of service and presentation has gone way down .
corners are being cut and it shows .
and the chairs have wheels !
weeeeee !
heck , ask for it after the check arrives .
it 's like a glass of water - it should always be full .
fyi , the sangria is f-ing expensive .
beware !
the house salad is awful and so are all the soups .
i was a bit confused on their use of host and hostesess .
great soup and shrimp caprice .
the only reason why i go there .
this location does get ridiculously packed all the time for some reason .
our servers have always been attentive and friendly .
if you do n't ... well then you 're in for a surprise .
jeff was awesome !
made us feel very welcome .
she apologized and said no one had told her that we were there .
i ordered bruschetta and salad and my companions had soup and salad .
olive garden 's soups are pretty good , i 'll grant them that .
but the bruschetta was just awful .
salad did have pepperoncini peppers , which were a nice touch .
the waitress was polite but seemed to be either new or overwhelmed .
she never refilled any of our drinks and just seemed sort of distracted .
we left her a nice tip though .
commercial italian - had a gift card so needed to use it .
moderately priced value for what is presented and always something to bring home
no apology , nothing .
i had soup & salad the other person had alfredo .
not complicated to pour some sauce on the noodles !
had to ask for drink & salad/bread refils .
over _num_ hours for an average meal .
it 's always slow when we go , but that was just insane .
overpriced just `` okay '' italian food .
went with a friend recently .
) .
other than that , their smoked mozarella fonduta was pretty good .
nothing much to write about the rest of the experience .
the service was the worst i have had in some time .
at that very same time our main entree came out .
i then ordered another drink .
back out as in from the heat lamp .
one bite in we realized the cheese had separated and it was barely warm .
we had a gift card and we were crusing through on a road trip .
why not .
alexis was great .
she was new .
thought she did well .
this olive garden really emphasizes excellent service in everything they do .
service was relatively slow .
the service and foods do n't worth the price .
this olive garden leaves me very confused .
the service was good ( even though the waiter was a bit awkward ) .
my fiance took me here for my birthday in august .
we were immediately seated , so far so good .
we were n't feeling good about this .
that 's proactive and we appreciated it .
nuts and bolts : went with the family to celebrate a birthday .
pros : everybody left content and very full .
our waiter kept the breadsticks and salad coming .
multiple orders of soup were taken .
love the extra cheese on top of anything you want .
great price- got all that food for around $ _num_ plus tip .
our waiter was very attentive and made us laugh a few times .
minestrone was ok .
he was wonderful .
very poor quality food .
the only bright side of this dinner was the pleasant waitress .
our pizza was mushy and undercooked .
i could n't eat it .
the description was nothing like the actual entree .
but the staff is really nice .
extremely poor service !
waiter always making excuses , food not as good as in past !
i have been to this olive garden so many times over the years .
and this is the first time i was disapointed .
our poor waiter was so over worked .
the blond female manager had sent people home and they then got a rush .
the funny as heck black bald waiter we had was the best .
he handled _num_ tables with grin and a joke for each .
he was as fast as he could be .
the food was okay .
but our waier honestly made the visit as good as it was .
i love olive garden , but this one seems to have poor service .
the only reason why i keep coming here is for the salad and breadsticks .
restaurant review :
alas not so good .
i ordered the steak medallion gorgonzola fettuccine alfredo .
somehow my two bowls of soup came out lukewarm which was quite disappointing .
unfortunately , not a good cut of beef as they were tough and chewy .
overall i will have to pass from eating here again .
pro : unlimited soup/breadsticks or salad if you want
hidden gem :
check sunday paper for coupons .
unlimited soup and breadstick .
he was funny , attentive , and kind ...
yes .
it 's a chain restaurant and yes , it 's pretty average .
love it ! ! !
never a bad experience ! !
we always hope manager susan is working ! !
food is worth every penny and service is awesome !
!
ask for the peach tea .
very good .
$ _num_ for a meal there and then another meal to take home .
average pasta with no meat , but a really good value .
typical olive garden , standard menu , nothing special .
the _num_ stars is due to the area .
we visited 6/6/15 around 6:30-7 .
party of _num_ .
we were seated right away .
we waited about _num_ mins just to order lemonade .
our cups sat empty for most of our meal .
we did n't have enough time for our app .
i have zero complaints about our food , just the service was awful .
we will be going back to olive garden , but not to this location .
we explained what happened and we were understanding because the server was relatively new .
the manager comped our entire meal .
this is not what we were expecting nor wanting ... we simply wanted refills .
i really appreciate that the manager went above and beyond for the customer .
they are so inn our face saying `` make sure you pay '' .
food was good but our waitress keisha s. was not friendly at all .
we had to practically beg for refills .
good food but lacks a family friendly environment .
another date night !
we had to wait about _num_ minutes on a tuesday night to be seated .
apparently olive garden is a hot commodity in champaign ... .
we were seated and i was quite indecisive about what to get .
i settled on a build-your-own-pasta with alfredo/cream sauce and added italian sausage .
not bad !
i did not like the sausage .
the thing that really upset me about the experience though was the service .
ugh !
we looked at each other and both agreed this meal was unnecessarily rushed .
2/5
let me begin by saying that our waiter was very friendly !
although he was really pushing the add an item into the bill .
asking us what we would like to chose between an apple dish or lemon cake..
i am usually extremely satisfied with champaign restaurants but this visit was pitiful .
joey was seriously excellent .
) .
it 's american style food , service is nice welcoming .
foods are cheesy and tasty .
you should definitely get both starter and desserts and share
if you dine here , ask for her !
she never made us feel like we were in a rush to leave .
my five stars go to her !
thank you shay for your amazing customer service !
: )
the review is only in regard to the service from the waitress shay .
i asked for my salad with no olives , it had olives .
i asked for meat sauce with my ravioli , i got red sauce .
i asked for a refill on my drink , never got one .
she came to our table maybe _num_ times total .
absolutely terrible service .
i 'm appalled .
my girlfriend and i always have great service and food here .
a good escape .
thanks olive garden .
i am not sure why this restaurant gets so busy .
_num_ .
water cup tasted soapy
_num_ .
utensils not cleaned properly
_num_ .
_num_ .
the garlic and wine sauce was really heavy and not appetizing .
_num_ .
the garlic bread were super greasy and honestly not very good
_num_ .
salad dressing very sour .
_num_ .
_num_ .
games on the tablet that comes with every table , costs money .
_num_ .
bathrooms at this restroom needs attention
!
however , when the two things are combined , the activity turns out positive .
( side note : the breadsticks were freaking beautiful ; inside and out . )
the taste though , was n't terrible , but was just average .
nothing exulted pizzazz ; so it was just eh .
they had a great selection , and fantastic service .
i got everything i needed quickly and efficiently and with interesting conversation .
great service .
my husband found the shoes he was looking for .
the sales associate was funny and interactive .
we will be back .
ca n't say enough good about cody and his team .
my grand daughter loved her shoes and would not take them off .
she said she looked like a fashion girl : )
a little shop on the triangle where neil street and walnut streets converge .
they made great use of the space .
great gift place .
the owner is so cool and can answer all your brewing questions .
so much charm and character .
i 've been going here since i was literally a wee one .
the owner is awesome ( and even remembered me on my last visit ) .
it 's a great little shop .
very nice place with a rich selection at expected premium prices .
a friend gave me a tip : their columbian coconut coffee ( wonderful !
) .
me : i thought you closed at _num_ !
her : nope , we used to , but we stay open until _num_ .
me : but the door says _num_ ...
me : so , you 're only open this week ?
her : nope , every week .
we close at _num_ .
me : do you ever close earlier , if it 's busy ?
her : well , we like to stay open until _num_ .
... .
cute shop .
lost a star for having tea that expired a year ago !
check the date before you buy it !
i did buy some tea still , they carry golden moon !
this place is an institution for me .
places with much better and more varied stock , and more reasonable prices .
but this is champaign , specialty demands spendiness .
are available in both loose-leaf and teabag form .
the shop owner will help grind your coffee upon request .
shopping for a gift ?
: ( i am thinking they do n't have good turnover .
the golden moon tea does n't taste like anything i bought from golden moon .
if you are in a pinch for some teas , this place will do .
but if you love quality and freshness , avoid !
the teas i bought from the jar taste stale and bad .
i also loved the array of chocolate they had .
it would make a great place to go to find some uniquely delicious gifts .
mmm !
so many of my favorite elements come together in this store .
tea , i adore it !
champaign , one of my favorite cities !
shopping with my daughters over the years , obviously priceless !
i have gotten presents from my daughters and bought myself treats here .
it is a tiny little store which is crammed with cute things to buy .
got tea ?
this shop has fresh tea , and it has stale tea .
really cool place with lots of delicious tea !
this is one of my favorite shops !
they have really good prices on tea , and they sell coffee too !
went to visit this place for the first time yesterday and i was impressed .
i bought a couple ounces and ca n't wait to try it !
pleased with everything else tho ! !
!
so many options of tea to choose from .
this is a great little shop to get gifts for your mom or grandmother .
drinking one of them right now - superb quality , great taste .
and the staff is super nice and helpful , definitely coming back !
do n't take the tea and spice prices for granted .
found this place on accident while in town for work .
so adorable and so affordable !
just tried a cup of their raspberry mint tea and i 'm love .
i wish i lived closer so i could come here more often !
walnut street tea is my favorite little tea shop in existence .
it 's so cute inside , and their teas are super affordable and delicious .
i love all the adorable teapots and accessories they sell too .
i often buy stocking stuffers or small gifts for friends here .
i hope this adorable corner teashop is around for a long , long time .
^w^
a wonderful shop with wonderful customer service .
fabulous variety of loose teas & coffees .
quaint tea pots , accessories , etc .
too good to resist .

the women who work here are extremely nice and helpful .
turtles ftw !
really overpriced candy .
the pieces are extra small .
the wait was interminable as a result .
overall , there are plenty of better places for chocolates .
my dad : loves this place .
the caramels are his favorite piece of sweet heaven they make
my sister : muy deliciouso
me : hard to not love this place .
the dark chocolates are just sooooooo good in particular .
check it out .
so good !
the hostess mints are magical .
that 's all i want now and forever .
caramels and pecan clusters are also the jam .
if you 're in the mood for chocolate , do n't think twice .
those are memories from my childhood .
i stopped in here and got a bag of my favorites .
i will be following up with corporate .
you chose to work there , treat the customers with some respect and patience !
i enjoy a good biryani , and they 've got it here .
several dishes are vegetarian , but meat dishes are prevalent .
the saffron rice is sooo good .
the service is decent but sometimes pretty slow .
they also have a few other dishes besides indian which is nice .
the food tends to be spicey and pretty authentic !
a lot of what they offer is geared toward the vegetarian crowd .
the complaint is the temperature of the food .
nothing i have ever ordered has been sizzling .
the food itself is just ok ... nothing has a distinctive aroma .
i say , go for the buffet on thursdays or sundays .
buffets are exactly that subpar to average quality food at an inexpensive price .
tip !
this is my neighborhood oriental ( more korean than other asian ) store .
pretty clean and decent .
i just wished they were a little bigger and stocked more things .
store review :
this is my first stop into a asian market down in champaign .
it seems to be well stocked and maintain .
the prices are average to slightly higher compared to chicago land asian markets .
there is a variety of goods from ramen to tofu to frozen fish .
pros : clean , well stocked
cons : prices more expensive than chinatown , chicago .
limited selection of fresh asian produce i.e .
chinese brocoli , bokchoy
hidden deals :
none yet
the ribeye is the best
for the greatest steak in town .
the service is stiff and hurried , but efficient .
the wine list is basically two choices : white or red .
the menu is basically two choices : steak or chicken .
but yes , the salad bar is good .
this is a place you only go to for one reason - steak .
expect throngs of locals , esp .
around athletic event times .
sadly , most of their constituency would n't care or notice .
the fresh bread you get there is out of this world too .
but i guess it is worth it .
i normal do n't eat steak but that steak and the chicken is good .
i also have a glass of wine with my dinner that is very delicious .
was sadly disappointed .
sadly no other steak cut options .
the pickled beets and freashly baked slight deepfried bread are awesome .
the decor is more than slightly dungeony from the moment you walk in .
i really do n't get some of the reviews of this place .
the salad bar is fabulous ?
ok , you people need to get out of central illinois more ... .
so here 's what this place is about .
it is called the ribeye and that is a perfect name for it .
just about the only thing you can order here is a ribeye .
but you ca n't get any other cut of meat .
all ribeyes all the time .
so you better like ribeyes if you come to this place .
now to the salad bar .
what is good about it ?
the salad bar is terrible .
where are the mixed greens or spinach ?
unless you want a _num_ ounce ribeye .
then they 've got you covered !
i had a great dinner experience .
the service was more than attentive .
had a really nice glass of wine .
all for under $ _num_ , food only .
i travel , try to get this anywhere - you wo n't find it .
the salad bar is nice , for me not that big of a deal .
the little loaf of bread is a nice touch .
just the way i wanted it .
great on all counts except the decor could really use updating .
the food is awesome though .
fair is stretching it .
the ribeye was a low grade supermarket cut .
not on my list to revisit in the future !
we arrived around 4:15 .
noticed there were quite a few people already there .
that not being a problem we were promptly seated .
and she certainly ate her worth of $ _num_ salad bar and more .
when will it stop snowing here ? ? ? ? ?
anyway , i ordered the _num_ oz .
ribeye medium .
when it came out on the sizzling skillet it was more like well done .
it was hard to cut and totally dried out .
my server noticed that i was n't happy and offered to get another one .
they make the ranch dressing and that is always a plus in my book .
the salad bar was good .
they have real bacon bits .
that along with homemade ranch dressing is the best in my book !
!
i advise go early ( they open at 4:00 ) or make reservations .
yes , they only offer ribeye steaks .
no deceiving there .
hence their name ,
the rib eye is solid and unpretentious .
you come for meat , you will get meat .
personally i like it better when i 'm not picking up the bill .
the vegetables are reasonably fresh and there 's a fair amount of toppings .
even so , this is not a good place for a vegetarian .
the rib-eyes are meaty and well cooked , not too overseasoned .
it was moist and delicious .
the steak fries are big and crispy but just a little bland to me .
ambiance/decor is n't the best , sure , but it serves its purpose .
the service here is fantastic .
the servers are professional , polite , friendly , and attentive without being overbearing .
the highlight for me , however , is the salad bar .
is it haute cuisine ?
no .
but it is solid , simple , and delicious .
the price is n't terrible .
two people with soft drinks and before tip comes out to $ _num_ .
ambience and decor :
let me first describe the restaurant 's ambience .
the restaurant is a dark , windowless interior space .
when i was there the restaurant was very busy and extremely noisy .
i imagine drinks and dinner while watching a football game would be an example .
there is a full bar in a space connected to the dining area .
food :
the food at ribeye is not to my taste .
the ribeye steak is low quality meat .
eating the steak is not a pleasant or satisfying experience .
perhaps a hamburger or meatloaf type order would be safer .
the salad bar comes with most dinners .
coleslaw would be on par with that available in a chain supermarket deli .
overall , the salad bar is not worth ordering .
it just is not very good .
bread is a hot , fresh loaf , but mediocre nonetheless .
also , ribeye does something to its butter .
these do n't appear to be prepared to order .
i ca n't comment on dessert .
summary :
it also has the feel of a sports bar .
prices are pretty much in line with what ribeye offers .
that is , prices are neither too high nor are they particularly good values .
service is adequate but unremarkable either way .
for me , this all is about _num_ 1/2 stars on yelp .
best salad bar in town ! !
good service !
!
the price is increased but the steak size is reduced .
disappointed .
worst .
steak .
ever .
why oh why ca n't we rate zero stars ? !
or better still , negative stars !
update : had to go again because my aunt is insane .
knowing how bad the steak is , i ordered the shrimp .
_num_ times worse than the steak .
the salad bar that people rave about ?
laughably bad .
hell , even the courier cafe in urbana has a better salad bar !
disgusting .
my family has been going to the ribeye for over _num_ years .
the staff is professional and very knowledgeable and helpful .
would highly recommed the ribeye for a classy , illini-themed restaurant any day .
the ribeye steak is what you come here for and is worth it .
ive tried ribeye at other places and arnt that good .
the ribeye knows how to cook it and serves on a sizzling plate .
my steak has been good every time ive went .
we did not make a reservation and walked in .
seeing we were not leaving , the hostess seated us within _num_ minutes .
this was a friday evening .
our waitress was extremely pleasant and took great care of us .
we ordered a beer on tap and of course , the ribeye .
salad bar is free if you order an entree .
the salad bar was great , but way too small .
it needs a different spot in the restaurant .
i ordered the _num_ oz .
ribeye while my husband ordered the _num_ oz .
it was a good cut of meat and well-aged but it was just good .
with two steaks and two beers our bill was $ _num_ .
i was impressed .
we had the ribeye , shrimp and chicken entrees .
all were very good .
the service was very good .
my fiancee and her family have been going to this place for years .
the service is always excellent and the food is consistently great .
the salad bar was excellent .
they had a delicious assortment of salads and pasta and even some fruit .
i had the chicken and shrimp meal and it was also delicious .
this is definitely a special occasion restaurant due to it 's steep prices though .
i 'm sure she will love it as well as i did
this restaurant is a great local spot with very good food .
ill definitely go again .
i believe it , very tasty ! ! !
the steak however ... .very disappointing ! !
not much flavor , and not a high quality meat .
would compare this is the sizzler .
overpriced for the quality .
would go back only for the salad bar .
ask `` where would you go tonight if cost did n't matter ? ''
and if that does n't work ask `` what restaurant is your favorite ? ''
`` what would you get ? ''
first time out of maybe a hundred i did n't get a good recommendation .
the quality of the steak is on par with almost expired meat from walmart .
harsh but true .
it was going towards medium well .
the salad bar was the only redeeming quality .
_num_ bucks before the tip .
mediocre at best .
plus the peal at the bottom was rock hard so i could eat it .
do n't plan to visit again unless someone else is buying .
the decor has n't changed in 20+ years , i 'm sure .
however , the restaurant itself is very clean .
the salad bar is my favorite -- always fresh , crisp and cold .
i ca n't overstate the freshness -- you constantly see employees changing the salads .
however , the steaks are always juicy and full of flavor .
i always get the grilled chicken with extra barbecue sauce .
it 's seriously the best out there .
i do n't like twice-baked potatoes anyways , and their 's is no exception .
i usually order steak fries or rice pilaf .
they have drinks , but they appeal more to the older crowd .
no biggie for me , i usually order iced tea or wine anyways .
the quality of the food and service is consistent .
go in with an open-mind .
they do what they do very well .
excellent local landmark restaurant .
love the salad bar !
a modest but flavorful wine selection is available .
i got the 10oz ribeye and it was a perfect medium rare .
service was good no real complaints there .
do n't know how to give 1-2 stars or i would downgrade the rating .
ribeye is my favorite steak but this did not cut it .
the small loaves of bread were hot coming to the table .
i had one slice - average .
the best thing going on was the salad bar and even it lacked .
by that i mean the lettuce was tired .
however a good variety of other things were there .
large portions - that 's the best i can say .
and that it was walking distance from the hotel .
but if it 's meh , who cares ?
it 's good , for what they are doing .
maintaining status quo for their regular customers .
to me , the salad bar is the best thing .
this is a steak house for the older clients .
always the same , and that 's ok .
what i did n't expect was a thin cut of ribeye .
i 'm used to a thick narrow cut of beef .
it was prepared exactly as i ordered but there was n't much flavor .
service was good and its walking distance from the hotel .
the menu is very simple .
the ribeye is very thin and comes out on a hot skillet .
the twice baked potato was very good .
the steak was good as well .
the ribeye serves ... you guessed it ribeye steak .
and they do a pretty good job .
the ribeye is on the thin side but cooked right with minimal seasonings .
salad bar was all you can eat with a decent selection of toppings .
overall a decent meal and good service .
this is not that kind of place , although it thinks it is .
the menu offers three options : ribeye , chicken , or shrimp .
i ordered mine medium , expecting a juicy , pink center .
i understand that the salad bar is a big draw for some people .
i ordered the steak fries , which were n't seasoned at all .
the decor was hilarious incongruous with the prices .
then you look at the menu and the three dinners cost between $ 16-23 .
i do n't mean to trash this place too much though .
the service was great , and the staff were very accommodating .
the ribeye said it was no problem .
i have to give them props for being cool about everything .
overall , i ca n't really recommend this .
you can get a mediocre steak for a lot less .
oh , and do n't order the fries !
i love that the menu is limited ... makes the decision process easier !
the salad bar was good too .
our server , ashleigh , was attentive and personable .
all in all , well worth the money .
awesome old school steak house .
danica my server was very attentive and knowledgeable .
menu is limited to what they do best .
great salad bar and the twice baked potato was full of flavor .
when in champaign illinois give it a try .
plenty on illini photos all around .
otherwise , i would never go here .
the steaks are ok , but thin for the price and always overcooked .
the shrimp is ok , too .
not my cup of tea but older people like it .
admittedly been years since ate there but not much seasoning on steak .
salad bar was good .
i have ate here probably _num_ times and never had a bad experience .
the salad bar here is beyond amazing .
food and serve is also excellent .
ps ~ brian is the best waiter .
he always remembers us and is super personable .
as a townie , i 've been eating here on special occasions for years .
a very popular place in champaign .
ahh , the ribeye , a university of illinois post game tradition .
i am only halfway joking .
even with the full house we did not have a long wait .
the clientele was a mixture of older couples and slightly depressed game goers .
they do have a salad bar that is included with your dinner .
it 's meh ...
i was impressed to see spiced apple rings on it though .
i had not seen those things since the grade school cafeteria !
i ordered a _num_ oz .
ribeye rare with sauted mushrooms and loaded baked potato .
so ordered the _num_ oz .
ribeye medium rare with steak fries .
they were not bad , but they were not sauted .
my steak was medium rare but it 's hard to cook a steak-umm rare .
seriously , my steak looked like it belonged on a philly cheesesteak .
pros : nice service , kind of cool retro atmosphere
cons : bland over priced food , over inflated reputation
nothing particularly outstanding about this establishment .
came here because it was close to my hotel .
steak was below average and service was lacking .
i would not return .
there 's nothing i like more than a well marbled ny strip .
ok - maybe a tender free range chicken .
it 's all fresh , favorful and kosher !
it 's the local butcher shop me and my fiancee had been waiting for .
it 's a good thing for customers in the know ...
every piece of meat i 've had here has been delicious .
you can also get some lunch food here .
their deli selection is small , but i find they have everything i need .
it is spotlessly clean inside , and full of tip top meats !
why did it take us so long to discover old time ?
the best beef i have seen outside of texas and new zealand !
absolutely delicious cuts of all sorts of meat ?
check .
employees who are helpful and actually know everything about their products ?
check .
the best yeast rolls i have ever found anywhere ?
check .
fresh bones for my dogs to chomp on ?
check .
and the list goes on ... ..
and their bacon is to die for .
the best bacon i have ever had .
i 'm drooling just thinking about it .
yum .
you will never be disappointed .
this place is so awesome !
they are always willing to go the extra mile here .
i highly recommend this place !
this place is the best place to get meat in the c-u area .
they 'll also cut you something special if you ask .
aw , yeah !
i never will go to county market for my meat shopping again !
change but they still have the classic bratwursts and mild and spicy italian sausage .
my complaint is that their hours and location could be better .
their staff is always helpful and they can help with getting special meat cuts .
best place around to buy quality meats .
i always go here when meat is to be the star of a meal .
this is a wonderful butchershop .
prices reasonable considering the quality .
the staff is very helpful and friendly .
they also have a small selection of fresh fish .
i 've had the cod and it was great .
also can recommend the pickles from the pickle barrel : )
knowledgeable , friendly staff .
sirloin patties and the twice baked potatoes are my go-to choices here .
will make a special trip for them .
good stuff .
i can not recommend this shop enough .
this place is the best .
if you need meat there is no better place in the area .
it 's so nice to have a locally owned butcher .
the customer service is outstanding and the prices are affordable .
my favorites :
fresh ground beef for very juicy burgers
fresh sausage , especially the kielbasa which is heaven
i love this place !
oh and did i mention the twice baked potatoes ?
!
the large twice-baked or loaded potatoes are absolutely to die for !
top-notch ingredients .
excellent supplies for bbq/smoking .
the staff is always amazing and the cuts of meat are even better .
i simply have not found anything there i do n't like .
fantastic establishment
really awesome deli here in town !
the staff is friendly and the meats are delicious .
definitely worth checking out as bbq season gets rolling !
awesome butcher shop !
awesome meat case with great steaks , marinated chicken and homemade sausage .
friendly and helpful staff .
i will stop back the next time i 'm passing thru .
just wish they were open on sunday so i could load up my cooler !
we love ( d ) this place .
and , i mean ... who does n't .
even rare game , a lot of times .
once , i had them get me some quail .
and the quality , too !
never buy that nasty meat again .
i mean.. whatever .
for such reasonable prices , it 's a wonder everyone does n't shop there .
oh wait , they do !
=d you can tell just by the parking lot .
parking can be a bit tricky .
they carry the beef house rolls !
they 'll praise your pastry prowess !
; d
i use this when i ca n't get to the meat science lab .
when items are on special , they have some pretty great prices .
super friendly people at this meat shop !
everyone is very helpful and they have such a wide variety of items .
they also offer boar 's head deli meats which are delish !
yummy !
large variety of high quality fresh meat .
as well as frozen meats and `` beef house '' rolls .
i only wish they were open sunday 's too !
great food , friendly and helpful staff .
they also have fresh fish which is super convenient !
highly recommend .
this is a quality butcher shop if you want to get quality meats .
where else can you find smoked chicken , cheese curds , and frog legs ?
i 've gotten some really good porterhouse steaks here .
so many things .
they are never pretentious and are always really willing to answer any questions .
i came here looking for salmon and was really really impressed .
you really have to come here to see what i mean .
it certainly tasted like that . )
it 's a little expensive but you get what you pay for .
_num_ % .
great selection and quality of product .
the staff knows their product and their customers .
truly gourmet items at reasonable prices
beef , pork , chicken , and fish , they 've got it all .
the potatoes are opposite the meat counter for the true midwestern folks .
this is definitely the place to go for excellent fresh meat and fish .
i swear their salmon is the very best in the area .
you ca n't beat them .
the staff is just as amazing .
always friendly welcoming and super helpful .
olde time is a carnivore 's dream .
they provide exceptional service and delicious meats .
you can get just about anything to grill or smoke at this place .
i love this store , i found my kind of clothes there .
and the prices are good .
the store was clean and so where the dressing rooms .
i ca n't wait to go back there.i could spend hundreds of dollars there .
very nice , yet crowded kohls .
i do n't like that they have so many things in the center aisles .
makes it hard to shop especially during the holidays .
the only place to get my husbands pants .
has some really cute kids clothes .
i buy much of my casual clothing there and find the selection quite accommodating .
can buy a whole bunch of $ _num_ , _num_ clothes .
has some unique brands which other stores dont have like simply vera wang .
our kohl 's in champaign is awesome !
the return department is second to none .
i 'm a huge kohl 's fan because of our local store .
who does n't love kohl 's ?
people who have n't shopped at kohl 's !
my work shoes are falling apart .
i purchased the fila work shoes .
who still gets fila ?
i do .
these shoes are awesome .
plain flat black , with slip resistant ( oil/water ) soles .
i get them at kohl 's ! !
!
it was weird .
mine was from rain .
i 'm not that large .
so , i got _num_ new shirts .
again , i walked with _num_ shirts .
i also got _num_ new pairs of trousers ( who still says trousers ? )
i got some new white socks , and some new plain black tshirts .
not that i care .
the gf is like `` wait , you have a kohl 's card ?
`` , and i 'm like `` yep '' .
the lady then asks , do you have a smart phone ?
and i 'm like `` yep '' .
_num_ % off !
so that was nice .
i 'll take _num_ % off on a friday .
sadly , no kohl 's kash today : (
as we are leaving , we walk past the jewelry section .
there 's `` watch and ___ '' combo thingies available .
watch and pen , for the fashionable writer .
watch and money clip , for the fashionable person with cash .
watch and ... bottle opener ? ? ?
for the fashionable alcoholic .
huge selection and tons of weird looking critters to stare at .
highly recommended if you have tons of questions .
my friends and i refer to this place as the aquarium .
and that is n't even the complete list !
the staff there is extremely knowledgeable , nice , and helpful .
you have to check this place out !
this place is waaaaay over priced .
they take advantage of being the only exotic pet store in town .
i try to avoid them as much as possible .
best local fish store within _num_ miles of cu .
this is a great store .
the employees are very helpful and knowledgeable .
so , went there the first time and thought the manager was great !
and now !
vowla !
baby rats appear out out of no where ! ! ! ! !
called and complained about the situation .
they could n't even offer anything else !
like a proper apology !
... ... ... .
best pet store ive been too .
they have high quality animals and best prices .
they are extremely knowledgeable .
friendly , knowledgeable , efficient and decently priced .
p.s .
a+ for this place .
i love this place !
they take good care of all their critters .
i still bought the dechlorinator , though .
they do have nice fish .
i got my first gold fish for my start up aquarium from here .
staff here are very friendly and helpful .
very knowledgeable staff and they have a great selection of fish and other animals .
sailfin is awesome .
hands down .
this is a small biz that truly cares about their pets and products .
some reviews mentioned too pricey and customer wait time to get help .
well , there is a downside and a benefit to everything .
the staff at sailfin are so knowledgeable .
they know the natural habitat of the animals they sell .
if they are selling you a product , there is a reason .
this pet store is the perfect example of how a small biz should be .
support your local small business and you 'll be supporting your community .
i owe it all to intelligent staff there !
thanks sailfin , keep doing what you do .
it 's really uncomfortable for them , and their tails can actually detach .
once again , a terrible experience .
i said if i could help it we would not spend money there anymore .
unfortunately we had a gift certificate .
i will happily spend that money elsewhere .
even if it means traveling to another town .
i 'm a fish guy , and this place is great !
i have been to this store numerous times .
my experience is hit or miss .
i could say the same thing of the owner , john .
very pleased with sailfin .
we will definitely be purchasing our fish and supplies here .
you ca n't beat the service here and the prices were fair .
love this place , the owner so helpful !
!
they have an unbelievable selection of yarn , and their prices were quite comparable .
this is the greatest place to buy yarn !
the yarn selection is fantastic and the teachers are great .
the knit alongs are fun as well as knit night .
this place welcoming and the prices are comparable .
i would suggest that knitters near and far visit this gem .
spent quite a while in here and loved it .
all types and price points of yarn .
staff is very friendly and helpful .
really enjoyed my visit here .
great experience .
going back again !
this is a home away from home store .
this is a really nice yarn store .
i have been to needleworks a few times for various projects .
every single time , the staff and the regular knitters have been incredibly helpful .
it 's such a nice place to be .
this free service saved me money for a service call .
i know it 's a chain but my experience here was relatively outstanding .
dropped in on a random tuesday night .
these guys did it right .
top notch guy .
great service .
drove back to autozone to return the jump starter and buy the battery .
both displayed excellent customer service , which is not so common these days .
highly recommended- with a shout out for their fantastic customer service !
make sure you go when the decent employees are working .
aka the daytime .
highly recommend if you can get decent help .
best combo of service and selection in central il .
browne 's fine jewelry will make your diamond buying experience a positive one !
here is why i think that :
the sparkle factor on their diamonds i looked at was high quality !
big city diamond quality and selection with great local family owned service !
so..
i got married !
yay !
.. last minute !
yay !
: )
let 's get married in the backyard ! )
in that short , frantic time , we kept thinking , `` hmm .
we should get rings . ''
so we ended up going to browne 's the tuesday before the sunday wedding .
she told us she 'd have them in by friday .
friday comes .
my ring is in , but his is n't .
size for us to use at the ceremony on sunday .
which we did , and it was beautiful .
we swapped the overnighted ring for his actual ring , and it 's perfect .
we 're exceptionally pleased with both rings .
the prices were good , considering the current market for gold .
like i said , we 'll be back !
i can not say enough good things about browne 's .
i 've been married for _num_ years now , engaged for over _num_ .
they found a loose diamond !
i left my rings with them .
oh , and they are replating it !
how much does it cost ?
nothing .
and i have to wait up to two days ?
i 'll take it !
they take care of their jewelry and their customers .
their selection and quality would be hard to find anywhere else in town .
i can promise you that i will not be shopping for jewelry anywhere else .
*edit* since i wrote this , i picked up my rings .
the setting was fixed and the metal was replated on both rings .
it looks amazing .
absolutely perfect !
my rings look brand new again .
the replating and the fixed setting did n't cost me a dime .
they really take care of their jewelry and their customers .
great job , browne 's !
thank you so much !
friendly and fast customer service .
i highly recommend browne 's !
never even came out of his hole in the back .
do n't go here ! !
!
i went here to have a battery changed in my watch .
went to sell my jewelry and they gave a fair price .
i guess i could have been tricked but i will never know .
they are the most incomeptent group of people i have ever met .
and they are completely non chalant about and could care less .
i do not recommend renting from u group at all .
there are much better apartments , and much better landlords in the champaign-urbana area .
university group staff is incredibly friendly and helpful .
specifically , the maintenance department is professional and quickly attend to your maintenance requests .
it took several phone calls and an in-person meeting to get my money back .
they were extremely rude when my roommate and i called them .
maintenance is terrible !
it takes a good month-2 months for them to even get back to you .
the leasing manager is terribly rude and the staff is clueless ! ! ! !
avoid !
avoid !
!
i moved in to my apartment on august _num_ .
when i opened the door the stench was overpowering .
honestly , i sprinted to the window to start airing it out .
it smelled like the last tenant was someone with _num_ cats .
and that was nothing compared to the fact it was so so dirty .
there were even stains on the walls .
i moved in on a saturday afternoon .
i spent saturday night in a smelly apartment with no power .
she told me to call my landlord .
i now had power .
no thanks to u-group .
horrible apartments and management .
lived in _num_ n busey and regretted every single day .
first they gave trashy apartment without cleaning .
second they do not agree that it is dirty .
and finally when you move out , they deduct _num_ dollars for cleaning .
while i spent _num_ days on cleaning it when moved out .
i could challenge them to show even little sign of dirt .
these realtors act like dictators .
never rent their apartment !
they do not care tenants at all .
it 's suffering living in their apartment year round .
they have a very responsible maintenance department .
compared to that , i think university group is much better at maintenance services .
the worst .
the apartment was dirty when we moved in .
just a bad experience all around .
do n't rent from them if you have a choice !
horrible horrible management , completely unreasonable and inflexible .
the positive reviews here are jokes , they 're probably ug workers .
all i can say is : do not live with university group .
and the rain dropped in our apartment .
every time they said they 'll come and fix it but they never did .
now we 've lived here for _num_ months and the fan still maintains broken .
our handle on the apartment door almost dropped .
reported several times with the fan problem , ug does n't care at all .
by the way , a raccoon came to our living place a day ago .
we tried really hard to keep it away .
i will never live with university group again .
i thought it was a thief break in ! ! !
i am a girl living alone .
can you imagine how terrified i was at that moment ?
there are _num_ men in my living room and i was in bed .
this is rude !
they have my number and email .
why do n't they notify me in advance ? !
the $ _num_ is due to painting the wall , which is hilarious .
i can not think of a reason for the wall to be painted again .
if the wall is clean , why it is us to be charged ! !
!
lastly , my friend come to visit me in summer .
and the parking lot is almost empty during the summer .
so my friend parked at an empty lot .
then the car get towed .
so who called to tow the car ?
why do n't you leave a note for a visitor 's car ?
and i got a notice from the landlord not my car get towed .
this is how differently landlord treat with their tenant !
!
carrie 's logo says it all `` funky to fabulous '' .
she has _num_ huge rooms packed with items the span the decades .
for a while , everything i had to furnish/decorate my house was from there .
a good deal of clothing , accessories , and an abundance of jewelry .
a variety of furniture and home furnishings .
unique , one of a kind , and odd items galore .
if you stop in , tell her gretchen says hi !
why , may you ask ?
imagine being a person of color who has just moved to champaign .
you 're new , confused , slightly nervous about everything .
and you stumble upon cool stores like furniture lounge or jane addams .
in the middle of the shelf , plain for all to see ?
a mammy doll , everyone 's favourite piece of standard racist darky imagery .
that 's right .
a mammy doll .
for sale .
in front .
of the store .
right here : http : //static.px.yelp.com/photo/klyie0vpup5qz3thj_rwzq/l
the look on my face should really sum it up .
every time .
not ok. not ok at all .
finally , five weeks after this first began , i flipped .
perhaps it was all the coffee at aroma .
and i thought , `` what the hell am i gon na do now ?
stage a sit-in ? ''
i paid $ _num_ for a piece of outdated , racist iconography .
i emancipated mammy .
she now angrily sits on my coffee table , making people feel uncomfortable .
do i feel comfortable that i bought it ?
and i officially hate carrie 's now .
but at least mammy is free .
one of their three ( four ? )
nuts ! )
so i 'm not surprised that she came into possession of one .
over the years , i have bought the following from them :
black cartoon deer bookends
an embroidered betsey johnson blazer
a green wool jacket from a traditional austrian costume
damask-covered victorian granny boots
ties
more cheap shoes
go here with no agenda and you wo n't be disappointed .
you will find a part of you you thought you 'd lost .
i am greatly angered by and disappointed in this place .
she also stocks many hats , shoes , handbags , and scarves/ties .
also , carrie is not always the most friendly shop owner .
this place is really cool , but it 's also really overwhelming .
i give it five stars for the awesome stuff they have in there .
it was kind of like walking through a museum .
things like that should just be thrown away ...
that comes out to about three stars right ?
if that is the case , stay away from here .
i am pretty happy with the vintage scarf 's i 've found .
very pretty .
i found my boyfriend a silk shirt for ten bucks .
always something of interest here .
meet great people .
simple .
one of the healthiest and most convenient places to get groceries on campus .
they have a variety of everything from organic cereal to environmentally friendly cleaning products .
however , my favorite items are the local foods .
and newman 's own cookies .
however , soon they are planning to open it up completely to the public .
location is a plus .
cool place .
definitely worth checking out .
have you ever walked , biked , or driven ( preferably walked or biked !
what 's more , many of the items are from local or family-owned businesses .
if you decide to leave , the fee is completely refundable , too .
check out the website link for more information .
apparently i came for opening weekend of their new store .
hmmm..
i decided to investigate .
this store relocated to lincoln square in to a new space .
hence why people were munching outside .
lots of good bulk , speciality , organic , and vegan items as well .
the staff here are always friendly and extremely helpful .
you can become co-owner for a $ _num_ investment buy-in .
sweet !
i could co-own a store !
i really like this little store !
it 's really new and clean which is nice .
great stop .
it 's all in or all out , judas , okay ! ! !
!
did ya look down the hallway , asshole ?
some other tribe of marketing-for-dummies-reading diarrhea-variety-shit-for-brains idiots already jumped on that loser train .
i 'm a poor graduate student that has a very expensive diet .
even as a member they are on the side of ridiculously over priced .
it 's cleaner and more like a normal grocery store than most co-ops .
this co-op has more pretensions of grandeur than most .
i 'm from chicago .
so that 's not why it gets _num_ stars .
maybe it was the overall lack of options .
i 've only been here once .
the people were n't friendly or helpful .
that 's when its irritating to see just how jacked up the prices are !
i used to be more impressed with the common ground food co-op .
it was infuriating .
i spend hundreds of dollars there .
for god 's sakes !
i had to ignore her behavior constantly .
but there are problems with other members there .
how insulting .
their selection is ok ... but natural gourmet is better .
the co-op is a hub of activity in urbana with bike racks out front .
great store , decent selection ( especially in bulk !
if you are shopping between here and sf , go here : )
common ground is everything a coop should be .
common grounds selection seemed very average .
the staff was very friendly and sociable , so that 's good .
_num_ stars , actually .
my husband and i live near chicago , , where whole foods stores abound .
we 're quite spoiled .
we unexpectedly found ourselves about _num_ miles north of urbana for a week .
what to do about food ?
that said , this place is a gem , thus the _num_ star rating .
it has the best that whole foods has to offer .
they list the farms their produce comes from , which i found charming .
the staff is very friendly and helpful .
the prices are reasonable , considering there is n't that much organic in town .
happy shopping !
i 've been in here a few times .
i have n't bought anything though .
i love the free recipes and all the organic healthy choices .
despite the prices , they seem busy enough .
i think this place is pretty great .
it just is . ) .
their prepared foods are all excellent ; may i recommend the asian peanut noodles ?
it 's better than nothing !
bring your own bags so you do n't have to buy one !
an excellent food co-op , with a sincere interest in the community .
i am very happy with the cg co-op .
their bulk section is really nice .
i 'll definitely be back , and might consider becoming an owner .
this is definitely the kind of local store that it feels good to support .
lovely bunch of people and a lovely store .
they have a very good selection of bulk goods , especially gluten free products .
small , but good .
wish i lived closer , i would go there alot more .
i am proud to call myself an owner .
their bulk section is well-stocked and the selection of local produce is impressive .
i am thrilled for the expansion in the fall !
i 'll tell you a secret .
i shop the bulk bins because there is variety .
i shop the sale items .
i do n't buy much else .
you have to bring your own bags .
should n't be a surprise , really .
the look you 're going to get is pretty side ways so look out .
all i have to say ... is the pretense in this place is rich .
watch out !
the store is becoming a very very awesome place to shop ! ! !
i must say .
i shopped here one year ago for couple of times .
it was a good place , but now it is just pure awesome .
i decided to become an `` organic '' vegan in early october .
i went there 11/8 .
the expansion is great .
they have more spices , an awesome tea selection and many other changes .
oh , they start to have a salad bar , which is so appealing .
they provide fresh side dishes and salads .
i love their expanded selection for spices.the bulk area just become my favorite part .
the fresh produce is on the more expansive side .
but , they all locally grown or organic .
we all know living healthy in an organic life is very expensive here .
it 's not their 's fault .
they have expanded the store and it 's even better .
the new cafe in the store was great .
friendly service and the food was very tasty .
i would highly recommend the hot roast beef sandwich with carmelized onions .
excellent selection of whole foods and organic .
good sales too .
they recently expanded and have a great salad bar along with pizza and sandwiches .
part of what makes this place so great is the people .
i shop here often and the employees genuinely seem like they enjoy their jobs .
they are easy to talk to , very helpful and kind .
one of my favorite places in the area ... .go check 'em out !
sandwichs , pizza , soups , burritos , salads , etc
meats , vegetarian , vegan , gluten free , etc
prices are very moderate and cheaper than strawberry fields .
they also have a salad bar , pizza , and sandwiches .
there 's a bakery , coffee , and soups .
everything i 've tasted has been pretty good !
i recommend bringing your own bags and using cash or a debit card .
since the store expanded , it seems like prices have come down a little .
the bulk bins ca n't be outdone .
the expansion did a lot for their prices in the way of shelf items .
good selection and good prices , especially considering that everything is organic and/or local .
) .
they have a great selection , and the staff is incredibly friendly .
tofu !
vegan yogurt starter !
seitan rubins !
chocolate !
wild apricots !
most excellent place even if it is a bit pricey .
.
.
we still shop here every week for a small bag of goodies .
i 'm so glad i found a co-op near champaign !
they have all the products a vegetarian health-nut could dream of .
i even got a recommendation of one employee 's favorite kale .
i plan to do all of my grocery shopping here from now on .
they even have wine ! !
: )
it 's a lot bigger now and the staff is super friendly and helpful .
they have great vegetarian and vegan options and a wonderful salad and soup bar .
i love their ready made sandwiches !
try the egg-less salad sandwich , it is awesome .
i have tried to reproduce their recipe to no avail .
my only complaint is that some employees come off as lazy .
i mean , they do get paid to work , do n't they ?
we love our food co-op !
my children love shopping here with me .
calling this place a coop is a misrepresentation .
the prices of this place are on par with whole foods aka whole paycheck .
whole food prices under the guise of a coop ?
no thank you .
my wife grew up in the urbana-area .
whenever we go visit her family , we always stop by the co-op .
lots of terrific variety and i have to agree with her about the soups .
inspired , hearty , so good .
common ground has a wonderful selection .
delicious daily soups , great coffee , beautiful salad bar .
they stock local , organic and delicious produce , meats , and cheeses .
very nice wine and beer selection .
i love it all .
but !
the staff ! ! ! !
these people are the best people in the world .
i miss rainbow grocery ! !
!
otherwise , i love what they 're doing !
i 'm a vegetarian & extremely grateful for this store .
the have so many meatless products for me here .
i 've gotten organic food & medicine .
to start off , i have the most fickle debit card on the planet .
today , it decided it did n't want to be read .
eventually she said it was on the house .
also , they have counter culture coffee .
that alone is worth _num_ stars .
i might do it again .
always give back or pay it forward , people .
this is a great place to get healthy , organic foods !
everything that they do have is really tasty and all reasonably priced as well .
took a cooking class making chard and mushroom pasta .
besides being given the recipe for this dish , the instructor had additional handouts .
will definitely take other classes .
behind the scenes , it 's not as great as it seems .
great products !
organic foods and products at a reasonable price .
nice environment .
i particularly like their fruits , vegetables , and bulk items .
i think most things here our overpriced and sub-par quality .
we are members solely for that reason .
we would otherwise have to buy those two items online .
for all other supplies , strawberry fields is a closer alternative and similarly priced .
this is a great place to get organic & natural foods & products .
it 's a nice & adjacent stop from the weekend farmer 's market .
there are outdoor dining areas , which are great when the weather 's nice .
the place is laid back & clean .
it 's consistently an enjoyable experience .
best little coop in the midwest ! ! !
to put it simply , i just feel good when i shop here .
my favorite items :
the quality is second to none and everything you buy is local .
: )
offers classes in their cafe section occasionally .
love this place .
the miller farms stuff is very good in my experience .
love the friendly atmosphere and all the organic options available .
i love their sandwiches made on local bread with the most amazing pesto ever !
if i 've learned anything about local communities , it is to support them .
common ground is comparable to whole foods except on a more local level .
very happy someone at the market told me about this place on saturday .
stopped in to get some dates , hummus , guac , & salsa .
they have a great selection of vegan products !
salad bar , coffee , pizza , etc !
the staff seemed really nice .
i love the co-op idea so major kudos !
do n't go here if you can avoid it .
update : six months later my `` new '' radiator began spouting coolant everywhere .
the next day my radiator tank was completely empty .
beware !
this garage is a scam market !
classic stereotype of a dishonest mechanic .
unreal negative experience .
truly a dishonest and compromised garage .
.
.which is obviously good for me : p
i 'd definitely recommend this store to someone shopping on a budget !
probably my fav place to shop in champaign .
what a huge home department .
the men 's department is sorely lacking .
need more higher end items .
hard to find the departments you needed- they could improve layout and signage .
never did see the men 's shoe department .
good selection of activewear for women .
improvements needed in the top department- i was looking for more casual items .
a better selection of toys than some other stores .
a better selection of books that other stores .
very good price for some designer brand .
esp like their underwear section
store review :
at least they have a tj maxx in champaign .
maybe there will be better sales later on .
the store itself is a bit cramped and the aisles very small .
i wish they would expand on that selection more .
pros : discount name brand items
cons : smaller inventory , not many items of yellow tag sale
hidden deals :
search high and low for red and yellow tag items
great place !
!
the people at this store are beyond helpful .
great people , great store , great experience !
this is by far the best drum shop i 've ever been too !
great selection of everything , especially cymbals !
also the owner & staff were extremely helpful .
i 'll definately be back !
best drum shop between chicago and memphis !
i stop by anytime i 'm in town .
excellent selection and service .
amazing drum shop !
i lucked out and found this while working in champaign .
if they do n't have it ( unlikely ) they will get it .
skins n tins is everything a good drum shop should be .
it 's small , but packed with gear and cymbals .
) .
pounce on their awesome cymbal sale in november !
edit : sale now is just all the time !
so pounce on their awesome cymbal deals at all times !
!
items are overcharged and there is no return policy .
very dirty store with dust all over the shelves and items .
indifferent and unhelpful personnel does not know the inventory of the store .
ridiculously overpriced .
do n't come here .
this company is a complete fraud .
wow are they jerks .
i definitely did n't feel welcome .
they gave me the run around .
do n't give these people money .
maybe one day they will do us a favor and go out of business .
convenient location .
i occasionally need a tool here and there for small jobs .
there are usually two guys working here .
like the other reviewers said , they are not very nice .
one of them is a little bit more friendly than the other .
i would give it zero stars if thats an option !
we booked _num_ tickets at 8:05 am on mar.16th from champaign to chicago .
we showed up at 7:50 am .
there were around _num_ people waiting !
we were stranded at the bus stop for _num_ hours in the cold wind !
no apology .
no explanation .
no specific schedule for the next bus !
please do yourself a favor by not using greyhound !
it was chaotic as people jostled each other to get on the bus .
this reminds me of the movie titanic where people jostle to get on lifeboats !
there is also a bathroom in the back , which is pretty clean .
there are two outlets per row , so charging electronics is convenient .
there is wifi on the bus too , but it does block inappropriate websites .
also , there are footrests under the seat in front of you .
it also smelled a lot like weed when i got off one night .
art coop saves my ass every time .
they are open late and always have what i need .
go on , quiz 'em .
been in here to look for stencils .
they did n't carry any .
prices seemed about right for a privately owned art shop .
now , not so much .
: / )
the prices are not great , definitely higher than dick blick .
i miss the old school art coop .
: (
of course it is in stock .
super helpful owner and staff even checked manufacturers ' sites to confirm acid-free .
this is exactly why i love this store .
it 's also convenient by bus and a nice _num_ minute walk from campus .
great store : )
i have nothing but good things to say about the art coop .
!
and then you would n't be full of so much negative energy .
so helpful !
!
where do you go when your washer and dryer break down ?
that 's right .
i like to surf the net while separating my whites from the colors .
and no , that 's not racist .
the laundromat is clean and big , so that 's a plus .
thanks for letting us all know via internet .
we 're very happy for you .
seriously , perhaps a greeting card would 've better .
then the inside : `` like my newfound attraction to men . ''
definitely the best laundromat i have found in the c-u area .
the normal washers are $ 1.50/load and then the dryers are $ .25/7 minutes .
what else could you need ?
they do have super speedy dry cleaning though ... .
i took in two down-filled winter coats , they took about _num_ days .
seems thinner and colder ever since .
for dry cleaning they are extremely expensive .
they are open everyday , however .
they have lost our business for good .
well , no more .
on top of it all -- they are extremely expensive .
do not go here .
i went in for their fluff and fold service .
i used the fluff and fold service _num_ times .
the first time , i was missing some pants .
so that forced me to go there again .
do n't support this business please .
the first time occurred a few months ago .
the second time occurred this week .
my husband brought in a suit and a $ _num_ coupon .
the fee for the suit was $ _num_ .
his charge should be $ _num_ , right ?
well , they charged him once for $ _num_ and again for $ _num_ !
however , now that it has happened twice , i do not trust them .
update : a day later , still no credit .
i drove down there with receipts .
tony , the manager , said his records show i was refunded ... twice .
on the hanger was a tag noting that it was to simply be pressed .
sigh .
last time i use any starcrest dry cleaning .
i brought the dress to starcrest just to see what they could do .
they got the stains out and saved the day !
a little expensive , but totally worth it !
this laundromat is the cleanest one we have ever been to .
this laundromat is connected to the dry cleaners and the air conditioning is comfortable .
this place has roaches ! ! ! ! !
i killed one that was on one of my washers with a dryer sheet .
i will never come back here again .
it 's a shame it was the one closest to my apartment .
when i went to pick up my dry cleaning , the cover was gone .
needless to say , i wo n't be returning .
we used the laundromat and it is wicked nasty .
they also have coin machines that work .
i have yet to have a problem here .
it is fast and convenient .
i 've been here twice for dry cleaning .
kinda expensive but they did a good job .
this was maybe the best dental experience i 've ever had .
i actually really learned a lot !
it was a totally lovely experience .
very nice , thorough , knowledgable .
the building and office might not be the newest , but really who cares ?
i also really appreciated that he was n't pushing expensive treatments and add-ons .
you guys , if you have to move from champaign , go with allied .
you think i 'm going to come to illinois to see your apartment ? ''
then i called allied .
amazing .
they kept calling each other `` sir , '' that cracked me up .
go with allied !
if you are affiliated with the university you get a _num_ % discount .
i used their moving service for my move to south carolina .
they were professional , helpful and punctual .
they wrapped all my furniture and packed it carefully .
we had only _num_ broken item which was a metal shoe rack .
great movers and i will use them again
if i could give these movers a zero , i would .
so we used these folks -- it was a disaster from the beginning .
amazing movers ! ! !
when we got to atlanta the guys moved everything into place .
will totally use them again !
i 'll echo what another reviewer said : _num_ star is _num_ too many .
after two hours the movers never showed .
thirty minutes later no one shows and i call and cancel .
despite all the haggling no one ever apologized .
moving is stressful enough .
save yourself the worry and avoid like the plague .
absolute waste of time contacting allied .
the phone lackey bragged about their bbb rating .
she promised a quote the next day , which i never received .
no one from allied ever contacted me again .
do not .
do not .
do nottttt use this moving company ! !
!
they are absolutely terrible !
!
your stuff will be _num_ weeks late , with broken and missing items .
their customer service representatives wo n't help you at all in locating your goods .
if i could rate this company zero stars , i would .
very unhappy and unsatisfied customer .
great one-of-a-kind furniture and accessories .
the owners are friendly and helpful and have a good eye for interesting items .
we 've scored some outstanding pieces at really good prices .
the highlight of today 's trip ?
hells yes .
now i can listen to jessie 's girl on my turntable ironically all summer .
do n't judge me .
i got an awesome _num_ 's vinyl couch for _num_ $ !
the best vintage shop in champaign !
furniture lounge is simply the best shop to go to if :
* you are redesigning your home and need furnishings , lighting , decor
* you are trying to find a unique gift for a friend or relative
* you love thrifting , antiques , or vintage
* you love mid century modern design
* you want to look at something interesting and beautiful !
they recently started taking credit via square reader in their new downtown champaign location .
scott and amanda are super nice and know their mcm furniture .
they have even thanked my via fb to shopping locally .
this shop is a true treasure for champaign 's mods .
i absolutely love the selection they have in this store .
i love the furniture and decorations .
really neat stuff .
it 's pretty fun just to look around and see everything .
i have the most amazing necklace ever , thanks to them .
they have some really unique pieces of jewelry .
i love the clothes , too .
i 've bought some of my favorite tshirts and sweaters there .
it 's worth it to go in and take a look .
lots of fun things to see and buy !
the f n best .
did i really start this review like that ?
yep .
i kinda want everything in the store when i go in .
there is something for everyone , and price points for everyone .
we love furniture lounge !
plus some perfect sets of wine glasses and drinking glasses .
yay yay yay !
this place looks as if the owners just raided the set of mad men .
they always have rad stuff every time i come in here .
you 'll find a diverse array of people dining here .
sometimes you 'll see students studying here .
the merry-ann 's at neil and kirby is a standby .
the regular waitress was awesome and knew what we wanted .
it is the typical greasy spoon and i love it for that .
got the t-shirt .
forget your calorie-counting conscience at the door .
what is it about this diner down by the train tracks ?
or its hangover cousin that adds hamburger to the mess ?
the billy goat 's of champaign .
'nuff said , but in case it 's not ...
i mean , they have a `` hangover burger '' for f*ck 's sake !
i love breakfast food .
merry-ann 's has amazing breakfast food .
ergo , i love merry-ann 's !
thirsty impairs my judgement ) .
- but better .
the stack after 1am is the only thing i ever really came here for .
but it sticks out in my memory .
ah the goodness .
i also went to the other newer location in downtown champaign .
but its almost too new and clean to enjoy properly .
this place is dingy and small , but it gives it character .
you 'll be amazed you ate it .
and more amazed you loved it .
the food was just okay , nothing to rave about .
you can find your regular grease-laden favorites here .
as far as specialties go , i 'd say , the diner stack ?
( note : rating only applicable from 2am-6am )
stack .
sausage .
over-easy .
biscuit .
and i 'd be a happy man .
merry ann 's version paled in comparison .
i gave them another shot a few weeks later , this time for lunch .
the peas were from a can .
have n't eaten there since .
i know waffle house is generally pretty disgusting , but i love it .
then i looked at the merry ann 's menu and .
.
.
no waffles !
wtf ?
good food , good pancakes , super fast service .
i was very impressed with that .
so overall , a great cheap place to go .
good old-fashioned american diner .
i ended up waiting ten more minutes after we had finished our other food .
but the pancakes were delicious -- fluffy and wonderful .
the orange juice was terrible .
it was room temperature when she served it .
yuck .
good times , though .
it 's a diner .
the food was pretty standard .
my special came with a very large portion of hash browns .
or i could be projecting .
he had the diner stack , biscuit on the bottom , eggs scrambled .
i had _num_ eggs over medium with bacon , hashbrowns , and toast .
service was excellent .
our waitress was very friendly , and our food arrived promptly .
i will definitely come back .
yes .
merry ann 's is a great place , a true down home american diner .
they have great breakfast food , which is all i 've ever had there .
i definitely recommend it .
for those of you health conscious , perhaps you can have wheat toast ?
that 's about the only health alternative here .
it 's really the gravy that sets this breakfast delight apart from the rest .
amazing diner food , but that 's it .
it 's still a diner , no matter how you cut it .
the price is reasonable and they 're open till all hours of the night .
making my ridiculous drunken forays into champaign-urbana much more comfortable and filling .
i love this place , but it 's just a diner .
i seem to always get the really short and rude servers .
the ones that make you feel like you 're not supposed to be there .
so , there you have it .
it 's great food , poor service , great looking diner , great price .
but , man have my waitresses been bitches .
not a fan .
however , no .
i have no interest in darkening the door of this diner again .
merry-ann 's is a cute , illini-paraphanalia-ed ( is that a word ? )
diner with overly hovering waitresses and bad orange juice .
interesting .
but ick .
their $ _num_ orange juice is pulp-less , watered down concentrate .
their hash is amazing .
it 's the reason why i 'm giving merry-ann 's its single star .
crispy yet soft , i could 've had platters of this thing .
biscuits and gravy .
oh gosh .
what went wrong ?
merry-ann 's does not know how to make a good gravy .
sigh .
oh well .
am still on the search for a great breakfast nook in champaign .
any suggestions ?
they have this dish called the diner stack ... .wow
i also got a biscuit to go with it .
service is your typical diner service so not bad .
i 'm pretty picky about mechanically separated chicken .
maybe that 's snooty , but i just hate it .
outstanding breakfast !
eggs so fresh you 'd think they had the chickens out back .
highly recommended .
an institution in champaign .
partly .
i mean c'mon man , it 's a diner for goodness sake .
ahh yes ... the stack .
but the key to the diner stack is the gravy .
it looks real thick , but goes down surprisingly smooth .
any way you order it really , it 's a thing of breakfast beauty .
traditional .
plain .
simple .
delicious .
and you might only gain one pound .
the other reason i hold this place in such high regard ?
the memories .
the people , the conversation , the bonding .
all of it .
i 've spent many a good time and never a bad time here .
i enjoyed everything about it .
i liked that they always asked if we wanted our checks split .
i liked the menus that never changed , except for when they got laminated .
i liked watching the cooks assemble a stack like an artist at work .
do eat here .
do not judge it until you do .
do try the diner stack at least once .
do not eat all by your lonesome ( invite someone . )
do not go there to study .
do respect the staff and other patrons .
do tip well .
do not sit in silence .
do engage in good conversation .
do not talk about fight club .
and do come back now , ya hear ?
so many words for a little diner in central illinois .
i know to some , it 's just a diner .
not me .
yeah it was far .
yeah it was never really clean .
yeah it was just diner food .
but to me it was more than just that .
the time i spent at merry ann 's was always ... comforting .
i 've been to marry-ann 's several times while visiting friends in champaign .
but hey , that 's what i expect form a place like this .
just take it for what it is ; cheap , greasy eats .
i suggest the diner stack with lipitor for dessert .
walked into merry-ann 's for breakfast on saturday .
there was no sign to indicate method of seating .
i stood there while several staff stood idly behind the counter .
they looked me in the eye but never acknowledged my presence .
i waited a bit and then left .
i will not return .
this is a total drunk-food/hangover spot for sure .
horrible service , ok stack .
i went to merry-ann 's for the first time on sunday morning .
merry-ann 's satisfied all of my breakfast cravings and then some .
i also got a half-order of gravy and a biscuit , plus a coffee .
the bacon was by far the most disappointing part of the meal .
it was just flavorless and gross .
everything else made up for it , though .
oh , also , i wish they had heinz ketchup .
merry-ann 's diner is the definition of mediocrity when it comes to diners .
unfortunately , champaign has a lack of diners and _num_ hour restaurants .
merry-ann 's diner is a truck stop style _num_ hour breakfast diner .
unfortunately , merry-ann 's is not very good .
i ca n't recommend it .
i suspect that this diner was designed to duplicate the successful waffle house model .
service is roughly comparable to that of other waffle house stores .
ditto for the decor , and , in fact , the actual floor layout .
( and the quality delivered is mostly poor . )
the hilton razed the restaurant as part of its renovation .
too bad .
the merry-ann diner is not suitable for breakfast at any time of day .
merry-ann 's just does n't do it for me .
1st off i have not eaten here in over _num_ years .
i could of ate cheaper at home with the same ingredients .
service _num_ stars , food _num_ stars , atmosphere _num_ stars .
overall _num_ stars .
so terrible .
everything ... besides the hotcakes .
this place is nostalgic .
but it 's consistently the worst coffee in town .
you can taste the stale .
even so , it 's a diner .
just a fantastic establishment with friendly people .
just okay food .
i can make better food at home for cheaper .
average small-town diner feel in all the good and bad ways .
restaurant review
i would have to say that the wait staff is top notch .
very attentive friendly and helpful !
the hashbrown were oily , no real crispy to it .
the sausage and eggs were good without complaint .
overall with the oil and salt , it was somewhat difficult to eat .
pros : friendly service , clean
hidden deals :
monday to friday _num_ am to _num_ am
_num_ eggs , _num_ pancakes , _num_ ham for _num_
ham omelet _num_
all day specials mon-thurs
super burger _num_
grilled ham and cheese _num_
best place for a hangover meal !
love it .
it 's a cute diner ! !
it 's suppose to be that way .
the breakfast burrito is very good .
?
this time , we went to the merry ann 's on neil street .
i 'd recommend the breakfast burrito .
ordered a mega omelet with no ham , it comes back with ham .
server was very nice about remaking it .
it comes back -- ham again ! ! !
left hungry .
not coming back .
otherwise , there are a ton of better options in town for the price .
that 's about the best i can say for them .
merry ann 's is definitely a place to recover from a rough night .
i just love breakfast .
exactly what you 'd expect from a greasy little breakfast joint .
cheap , good , reliable breakfast food .
the breakfasts are always fast , tasty , and cheap .
what more can you ask for ?
the customer service was just that bad .
the front door had greasy finger/hand-prints all over it .
when i pointed it out to the waitress , she just shrugged .
so disappointed in the whole experience .
classic diner - great diner food , classic feel ... .tradition !
what more to expect for a diner -- great food and a relaxed ambiance .
an old-school diner that is exactly where it should .
this place was so good .
almost reminded me of the waffle house back at home .
it was clean and the service was so nice .
it 's always pleasant to find a good greasy american breakfast joint !
and you do n't have to drive all the way up to north prospect .
having _num_ billion things on your menu does n't make you a good restaurant .
but still , it hurts my head just to open the menu .
so i ordered the first picture i saw that looked appetizing - fish tacos .
delicious .
but our waiter sucked .
he actually yawned while repeating our order .
i mean , come on .
the broc .
the salad was good and so were the bread sticks .
however , we were not asked if we wanted more .
it 's endless right ?
wrong , not if they do n't ask you if you want more .
the server was invisible .
every time we wanted something we could not find our server .
he also took my salad before i was done with .
he just took it .
he did n't bother to ask me if i was done with it .
he just snatched it while i was n't looking .
why ?
there was still a lot left .
but , we were there for over an hour .
they were so slow .
they were really salty and just ... well , not good .
we also split a burger , which was decent , but very very heavy .
i think i maybe had _num_ bites of it .
fridays is fridays .
i do n't know what people expect of the food .
it 's a chain restaurant , not gourmet .
i was just excited that my side salad was n't all iceberg - bonus !
absolutely the best fried chicken in town .
the only problem is that they serve it only on sunday .
we have very limited places in champaign that serve good fried chicken .
the wait staff is extremely friendly and the place is always clean .
this place has real good food .
we always seem to have the jack daniels ribs .
they are so good they melt in your mouth .
i refuse to go to tgi friday 's in champaign anymore .
i 'm very forgiving when it comes to service .
however , truly bad service is inexcusable .
i came with a couple of friends and ordered a frozen margarita .
this is n't what bothers me .
at another restaurant i 'd be totally willing to forgive and forget .
it happens .
her reaction was what soured the experience .
she did , and the meal was fine .
the food is alright , but nothing spectacular .
i had a cheeseburger and fries , and it was pretty good .
i liked the fried green bean appetizer with wasabi ranch sauce quite a bit .
the real shock came at the end of the meal .
i wo n't be back .
disappointed .
normally things here are ok - nothing fantastic .
yesterday , i ordered carryout chipotle yucatan salad for lunch .
the menu said the salad included cilantro and avocado .
i got exactly _num_ tiny chunks of avocado and zero cilantro .
in addition , it was a hot mess .
the prices are also very reasonable .
i would recommend it to my friends .
very little to complain about with tgi fridays .
always worth a visit a few times a month .
the arrival of our food was the second disappointment of the night .
the best example of this was one of my friend 's pasta dishes .
talk about bad presentation !
needless to say , he finished it but still went home hungry .
this is all on top of the ridiculous prices they charge .
i do not understand the reviews that say 'reasonable prices ' .
yes , the food is usually pretty tasty , but it is very overpriced .
almost $ _num_ for _num_ mozzarella sticks ?
$ _num_ for a small steak ?
bad values all around .
not a problem specific to this location , but a flaw nonetheless .
why would you choose t.g.i .
friday 's when there are way better deals all around you ?
horrible , horrible , horrible .
do not go here .
the service was bad and the food was worse .
i love chain food but this place is awful .
i doubt i will ever go back to a tgi fridays at any location .
we got the _num_ for $ _num_ deal .
i ordered some sort of pasta alfredo with chicken .
it was one of the smallest portions i 've ever gotten in a restaurant .
the pasta was so overcooked it was mushy .
the chicken was so overcooked i could barely cut into it .
save yourself the time and money and avoid this place .
solid .
closed .
well i forgot i had posted that it was closed .
i managed to get them to come back to champaign , il
they are now located up by the market place mall .
the store is a lot bigger , and their new crew is fantastic !
the food is .
you wo n't be disappointed !
crepes , desserts , wine .
i guess they were n't expecting local goat cheese buckwheat crepadillas .
the food is french , mostly crepes , and pretty tasty .
still , it was pretty good .
we also had two glasses of french hard apple cider : delicious .
the wine and beer lists are also extensive and interesting .
i ca n't wait to go back to try more of the menu !
i am pretentious and i love pretension .
carmon 's offers pretension and delicious taste all at once .
no , seriously , it does .
or from toulouse latrec ( at least the john leguizamo version ) .
well worth a trip for brunch .
we went to carmon 's for sunday brunch and the place was packed !
so packed , in fact , that the service suffered noticeably .
the decor is amazing , however .
i ca n't believe it 's the same carmon 's .
i love crepes and i expected pricey and gourmet .
well , i got the alone time , not so much the scrumptious meal .
too bad .
the $ _num_ side salad was lovely .
a nice change of pace for brunch -- simple selections done well .
we especially loved the complimentary bread with butter with smoked sea salt -- -delicious .
the escargots were quite good as well .
kind of an odd experience eating here .
everything was either really , really good or really , really bad .
it was pretty trashy for the otherwise very nice atmosphere .
the portions are tiny , especially considering the prices .
so , bad ingredients + bad microwaving = $ _num_ dessert .
no thanks .
beer selection is good , but also very overpriced .
as always , options are really creative , but more importantly , delicious !
all portions were generous , perfectly cooked and quick to the table .
the creamed spinach was smooth , sophisticated and rich .
and it was .
carmon 's has quickly become one of my favorite eateries in c-u .
i mean , it 's a creperie , right ?
the fish special is worth having every time you go .
the seafood st jacques crepe is also consistently amazing .
i am such a huge fan .
i am stuffed , and stuffed with amazing food .
did i mention the totally funky cool decor and friendly staff ?
i do n't understand what is wrong with buckwheat crepes ?
i love them .
and that is what they avoid .
i have mixed feelings about carmon 's .
it was absolutely amazing !
i highly recommend ordering this item !
the smoked salt that is used to flavor the butter is also spectacular .
there is an amazing amount of flavor packed into each grain of salt .
very cool .
overall , i highly recommend carmon 's for breakfast .
this place is an absolute joke .
it 's extremely overpriced ( $ _num_ for a solo ham and cheese crepe ?
carmon 's is the restaurant gem hidden away in champaign .
i go there with my girlfriend to eat steak and crepes .
the food has been consistently good , and their specials are always interesting .
it gives a pleasant atmosphere to the place .
the place is clean and kind of cool with friendly service .
a great place to take your parents .
great little place !
anyways , i definitely forget the name of the dish .
; - ) anyways , delicious .
i also had some coffee which was obviously fresh-brewed .
they have a little espresso bar ; my companion got a double espresso .
the waitress was kind and attentive and the atmosphere was laid back .
i will certainly come back and update this review !
**a special thanks to matthew l. for helping with this review !
so i expected slow service .
the food was standard .
and i asked for cheddar on top - what the hell ?
$ _num_ for shitty american shredded cheese ?
do n't expect me to come back here again .
no thanks .
i love carmon 's .
good bloody mary 's .
good crepes , good service .
awesome restroom .
beautifully decorated .
miss this place , and that cute lil redhead that works there too !
: )
amazing bloody mary 's .
really yummy french onion soup -- it has a crepe in it !
beautiful ambiance ... just adorable .
this place definitely tries way too hard to be something its not .
this is not the case here .
the one thing that was good was the crepe suzette .
i have never seen a restaurant that hires waitresses this horrible .
we were placed in the corner of the restaurant too .
she then disappeared for the entire meal and came back only for the check .
now heres the good part :
thanks but no thanks .
we refuse to come to carmon 's ever again .
we left the discount card on the table .
walking in , we had a good feeling .
the ambiance is really nice - very shabby chic with some refined touches .
i ordered a $ _num_ ham and cheese crepe .
once they took his empty soup bowl away , the wait began .
we were not encouraged .
we probably did not get our food for another 20-30 minutes .
and again , there were _num_ other parties of _num_ in the restaurant .
while we waited , no one came to update us .
no one even looked at us .
mine was unevenly heated and very salty .
my husband says his was decent .
we each ordered coffee , which took about _num_ minutes to bring out .
i will say that the buckwheat was too heavy for the rich filling .
i do n't know why they could n't have used white flour .
i have not had any nightmare experiences like other diners .
i adore the bread with smoked salt .
the coffee ( with constant refills ) is excellent .
the pork crepe with fried egg is out of this world .
so is the crepe suzette .
definitely go for their specials -- they 've never let me down .
the service has always been pleasant .
you definitely have to bring out the pocketbook , but the food is quality .
enjoy !
the whipped cream was also made fresh and delightful .
the prices were horrid though .
price is the only reason i wo n't come back so often .
still love carmon 's !
delish !
love how they keep in interesting .
ca n't wait to go back .
this is a small , shabby-chic french restaurant serving simple french food .
i recommend the salmon starter and specials .
service was relaxed and friendly but not slow .
my parents both enjoyed the coffee .
we went for dinner on a sunday night .
we were three of five customers in the restaurant , which was off-putting .
i guess they only just started serving dinner as well as breakfast and lunch .
the crepes were great .
the service was great .
our server ( # _num_ ?
possibly the owner ? )
was quite jolly .
i 'll go again sometime .
it was an excellent choice and certainly unique .
the waiter was comical and super friendly , and the service was perfect .
i sampled the quiche and my own breakfast-esque version of a crepe .
both were delicious .
i also enjoyed the complimentary bread & butter with roasted sea salt .
went here for a weekend brunch with my boyfriend a few weeks ago now .
both our crepes were delicious !
love crepes !
i 've always eaten them as desserts with chocolate and banana nutella .
the lunch crepes are great , and you can even build your own .
i definitely recommend at least trying it out !
things not to miss :
curried cauliflower soup
split pea soup
the pate/salad plate
and any crepe with ''two fried eggs '' on top .
oh yeah !
great place for a fancy breakfast .
so i liked carmon 's .
i would assign it a few demerits , but mostly gold stars .
i would like to try more crepes at a future visit .
love this place .
he is an absolute hoot .
he definitely adds to the pleasurable experience .
i suspect we will return to carmon 's for brunch during our next visit .
it was just very laid back and , well , french !
the stroganoff crepe was delicious , as was the nutella crepe for dessert .
i 'd definitely go back -- when i 've saved some more pennies .
carmon 's is a restaurant reminiscent of a small specialty restaurant in europe .
it is at its heart a creperie , and its crepes do not disappoint .
the food is good but the customer service is awful .
not worth the hassle .
try original house of pancakes for breakfast instead
we had reservations and were seated right away .
to our delight , they shifted us there without a fuss .
oh .
so .
good .
highly recommended !
the service is wonderful .
i have always been seated right away and the servers seem happy to help .
they have a wonderful wine selection and the food is fabulous .
they have a variety of crepes and quiches .
there is always a special for the day .
today i had a wonderful goat cheese quiche .
it was the special and came with a salad .
unfortunately , i had no room left for one of their delicious dessert crepes .
yum .
love !
love !
love !
... ..we had a super afternoon at carmon 's !
we stumbled across carmon 's on our way from chicago to new orleans .
seafood st. jacque crepe ftw .
expensive there but worth it for this incredible crepe .
carmon 's restaurant has closed .
but the space has been reincarnated as carmon 's bistro .
so look for reviews of carmon 's bistro !
do you have bored children on your hands ?
the orpheum can quickly take care of that !
it is a little rag tag compared to other children 's museums .
but the live animals usually get everyone interested !
houdini performed there back in the day !
i took my children here while visiting my sister in champaign .
i was expecting something along the lines of the normal children 's museum .
wrong .
it was nothing like it .
the place was dark and dingy .
it needed a thorough cleaning .
i was afraid to let my children play with the toys there .
we could barely fill up _num_ minutes here .
the water interactive display had no water in it .
the sand exhibit was missing some sand .
my family came here saturday for the willy wonka chocolate experience- what a joke !
upon entering the main room to pay , the cost was $ 9/person .
i was wrong .
there were about _num_ people crammed into the main room , paying .
charlie and the chocolate factory was playing , but there was no volume .
there was nothing resembling the chocolate factory .
what ? ?
i am not kidding .
these people are clueless .
that was the first experience .
it goes on and on .
why did they even need the bag ?
where were the oompa loompas and chocolate ? ?
the only chocolate i saw was a drawing of a chocolate fountain .
for $ 9/person , you can surely do better than that .
the whole thing took less than 1/2 hour .
we complained and were reluctantly given our money back .
this was a joke- do not take your kids here .
what a sad , sad place .
to begin with , the place was dirty .
it looked like no one cared about it .
there were no exhibits , few play stations and fewer that actually worked .
there was absolutely nothing to commend itself about this place .
what toys they had were either broken or of little entertainment value .
do n't be fooled .
avoid this place ! !
!
one word nasty !
and our allergies started to act up .
i 've gone to places that r free and are cleaner than this one !
we had such a great morning at this children 's museum !
it 's such a gorgeous space , with many new exhibits .
it 's such a gorgeous space , with many new exhibits .
our visit lasted about _num_ hours and i recommend this as a family destination !
a joke .
not sure if it 's a joke on us - or the kids .
i would n't recommend it .
dirty - everything is dirty and dusty .
and if your lucky - the dino exhibit outside will be open .
plus - $ _num_ to get in ? ? ?
seriously ? ?
we came as a family outing over the holidays .
my three kids 9,7 , and _num_ found plenty to interest them .
worth $ _num_ each .
a birthday party was just wrapping up while we waited for opening time .
my teenage daughter and i really enjoyed the momentum machine on the lower level .
you 'll start spinning faster and faster !
we were so dizzy but kept trying it out over and over again !
that did n't deter us from trying everything though !
very casual , comfortable place , a little further off campus .
laid back .
huevos rancheros is another favorite of mine .
laid back place .
pretty decent food overall .
fyi-the lunch specials are yummy and a great price-check them out .
te amo , fiesta cafe !
oh , man .
i 'm making myself want to go there right now just thinking about it .
it 's also very reasonably priced , and the service was very friendly .
nice place !
ah , fiesta cafe .
ridiculous .
awesome .
hilarious .
next , the service is fast , friendly , and the food delicious .
i ordered the chilequiles , which i 'm a bit particular about .
and i was delighted .
't was nice to see a cool , friendly environment .
i was delighted .
this was awful .
base on the reviews from this site we decided to check it out .
howerver that 's when the good times stopped .
when the food showed up it was just as bland as the chips .
just unacceptable .
it was the straw that broke the camel 's back .
tamarindo !
in fact , it may be my favorite restaurant in town .
they give you free chips with two salsas , one spicy and one mild .
this place has been very hit-or-miss with me .
the setting is always nice , especially with shady outdoor seating during the summer .
and they do chiles rellenos well .
this place was poppin !
we had to park in the dallas and co .
parking lot cause the parking lot was full .
overall , the food though was n't that great .
i particularly love the chimichangas .
three stars for the food , and an extra for the great margaritas ;
i picked _num_ stars , which means , according to yelp , `` yay !
i 'm a fan . ''
and i am , because this is one of my go-to restaurants .
fiesta cafe has the best mexican in champaign/urbana .
everything is n't made with the same ground beef , there are choices .
on a nice night , outdoor seating is fun .
great mexican beer selection and drink specials occur .
i 'd give it _num_ stars for the margaritas and the service .
our server was really nice and attentive .
the food though , has much to be desired .
last night we went there and i got chicken tacos .
they were so horrible that i only took one bite .
they were that bad .
the chicken tasted like it was canned .
the chips are good and the salsa is n't too bad either .
good place to go if you 're just looking for 'ritas and chips .
i was disappointed .
i much prefer tortillas that restaurants make themselves .
as the saying goes : i 've got _num_ problems .
the ambience was fine .
it was bright and kitschy in ways i find endearing .
getting the order wrong and forgetting a side ?
forgivable .
ruining tequila with a syrupy excuse of a marguerita ?
bad news .
swapping the meats on my bfs platter ?
worse news .
a soggy fry job on a cimichanga : death warmed over .
it has a nice attitude that feels very independent , spunky , and spontaneous .
four stars is for the the overall vibe- enjoy it for what it is !
!
good service , very mediocre food .
ordered a carnitas burrito with beans and rice .
the typical tex-mex place .
another spot in champaign that seems like it has been open forever .
the building is made of adobe , with a great shaded outdoor seating area .
a few dinning areas inside with a bar in the back room as well .
service is hit or miss , depending on how many people are here .
the food is very typical for this kind of joint .
tacos , burritos , chimichanga , and various lunch specials and combinations .
globs of refried beans and starchy rice .
a bunch of different margaritas , and a crap beer list .
that is it .
good for a nostalgic trip when visiting the family .
though nothing to go out of your way for .
this place reminded me of burrito king .
tried the fish filet dinner with rice/pinto beans .
it was great , and way too much !
friend did n't like the black beans much though .
excellent service , they serve chips and salsa too .
very good greasy-spoon mexican place .
they have tons of tequila choices .
my husband had the mixed fajitas , and enjoyed them .
portion was huge , and we brought about half of it home .
i had the pozole and alex taco .
both were flavorful .
pozole had a nice amount of spice .
we 'll return .
i read a few reviews about this place before i went .
unfortunately i should have followed the negative reviews .
the rice was drenched in grease .
it even smelled bad as the waiter put it in front of me .
i actually gasped .
i bet they are good .
omg out out a bag , just horrible .
the salsas were good .
i promise you i will not be going back .
too mad for them because , as i said , i love mexican food !
they have massively awesome margaritas , and are super vegetarian friendly .
had the vegetarian fajitas , and my wife had the chicken burrito .
we both had the black beans .
food beats the hell out of the other mexican places in town .
_num_ stars = `` yah !
i '' m a fan '' i guess that sums it up .
i dig the funky vibe of fiesta .
i use to come here in my early twenties and gorge out .
back in those days , i had not yet been to many authentic taquerias .
so i thought fiesta was amazing .
but then again , i also thought dos res was awesome .
i became a bit of a mexican restaurant snob .
i moved away , had many many amazing mexican dishes during my travels .
moved back to cu a couple years ago .
well ... i love this spot .
it 's a long standing tradition of downtown champaign .
i 'm a fan of the enchiladas , chicken/mole to be exact .
boom !
done !
good !
the staff is super as well .
they are pretty great .
margarita good : ) .
fish tacos and chips not stellar ; ( .
would not return : (
i ordered the chiles rellenos and was pretty disappointed .
ingredients seemed low-quality and overall preparation was subpar .
everything was drowned in a red sauce that tasted canned .
i have made this dish better at home .
however , our server was a really nice guy .
this place is great .
gay night every wednesday in the back room with amy .
her margaritas are on point and her attitude is perfect .
she 's fun to work with and always has a smile on her face .
i love trying new things here ( which is rare for me ) .
my beef burrito was mostly beans and almost no beef .
$ _num_ pacifico beer was a plus .
love the cimichanga with a huge strawberry margarita at fiesta !
fun place to eat out and the chips and salsa are good as well .
chips and salsa - bad had to sprinkle salt on em for flavor !
the food , maaaaan !
not again , ever ! ! !
i love amy tho !
lol
the cebollitos on the tacos were so amazing !
not very authentic , and my rice was severely undercooked .
they used yellow cheese on my tacos .
much better choices for mexican food in champaign .
amy is the best !
i came here pretty often my junior year at the u of i .
always run into people i know at this great place .
been going here since they first opened more than _num_ years ago .
it 's a very friendly place with great food and awesome margaritas !
i love this place !
also amy is the best waitress !
what attracted me the most was their ( huge ) margarita menu .
first of all , the drank .
it was delicious .
as for the food , it 's not perfect .
the food tasted great , but it was n't exactly authentic .
will be back again and again and again .
always wanted to try this place .
i wish i had when i was a student .
met friends here .
unsure about the restroom .
so minus a star for that .
shared the asada relleno meal , chile relleno , and horchata .
loved their horchata ; very milky .
it came with free refills .
liked the meat in the asada relleno .
the chile relleno was good , a bit sour .
free chips and salsa for dine in .
my absolute favorite sit down mexican restaurant in town .
i hope i 'm not forgetting anything in there .
amy is the greatest server , but the rest are pretty good too !
also white cheese sauce with chorizo is very good .
best mexican food in shampoo banana .
hands down .
i love coming here .
the food and the drinks are great !
our server was very friendly .
service was 4~5 star .
i 'd give the food _num_ stars .
we ordered a horchata , a burrito dinner and the el presidente .
the horchata was so good !
it 's perfectly sweetened , very fragrant and smooth !
i used to work in new mexico and really enjoyed new mexican food .
i liked the chicken taco in the el presidente .
the chicken was very juicy .
however , the steak in my enchilada was on the drier side .
they do give a huge portions .
each dish could be two meals for an adult .
would love to try their margaritas in my next visit .
my experience with amtrak was surprisingly pleasant .
i think i will use the amtrak again !
when amtrak is good ... it 's really really good .
but when it 's bad , it 's terrible .
whenever i ride the saluki , it seems to get delayed .
once it was delayed four hours .
i was not happy .
umm .
special , well..except wish i had invested in a good pair of noise-canceling headphones .
the bus took over four hours .
amtrak needs to get its act together and i need to get a car .
hey , gas is n't cheap and amtrak was .
unless you buy your tickets several weeks in advance .
!
a _num_ foot winnebago would cost about $ _num_ .
did i mention i 'm having a slow day at work ?
it should n't be a big deal to go to chicago .
it should n't use up all my money or my patience .
i 've had _num_ hour delays on amtrak !
chicago is a major travel hub and the closest major city .
the fact that it is so difficult to get to hurts the university .
sweden benefits enormously from having fast , relatively cheap , and hassle-free railway .
i 'm bragging now , but uiuc needs amtrak to shape up .
the delays have ranged from _num_ hour to _num_ hours .
this is the best way to get to and from chicago from champaign .
you can even walk around , and use a human-sized bathroom .
just sayin ' .
departs from chicago on saturday/sunday morning at 8:15am .
a night to never remember .
( same goes for the reverse process on our arrival back home . )
clean bathrooms , a subway and vending machines downstairs , very reliable wifi .
but the reason i went for four stars was one man : `` mr .
charles . ''
he 's incredibly helpful , funny , and sweet .
he 's just incredibly polite , and manners go a long way .
so amtrak , please read this and give him a raise !
two outlets at every seat , pillows available upon request .
no wifi ?
no me gusta .
i was definitely disappointed there .
come on , now ) .
those people are everywhere , that 's not amtrak 's fault .
i love taking the train whenever i come back home to champaign from chicago .
being flexible with times is also an advantage to getting a good deal .
last time i took amtrak anywhere it was to chicago from champaign .
a clean station with helpful staff .
the crew on the trains were always very pleasant and eager to please .
the food in the diner car was outstanding .
i wish the guy in front of me would stop farting .
also another lady to my right smells like play doh .
recommendation : bring some odor eliminating plug ins or something
this means you , the passenger , will most certainly be delayed .
regarding ticket prices , it competes with greyhound in terms of cheapness .
hence you pay less then a bus ticket if you plan accordingly .
the train itself is really nice and clean .
pick a nice smelling passenger to sit with and you 'll be fine .
ughhh .
the wifi sucks though and is not reliable in my opinion .
train arrived over an hour late : ( .
this station is one of the better ones i 've been to .
typically , they 're about an hour late .
one job and they have never been on time ... .ever .
how can that be ?
time to reevaluate your business model .
my use of this amtrak station is very limited .
i actually have n't used it for the train .
i have been there to pick up friends from the train .
i like that this station serves many functions .
the train , city buses , and charter buses all stop here .
and they are located in different areas , which makes it easier to navigate .
when the greyhound arrives , they call out the bus information .
very helpful for passengers .
but that staff there were nice and helpful .
expect your train to be _num_ minutes late .
the staff is super friendly and helpful .
andy 's towed the car within _num_ minutes of the call .
super fast service .
pretty remarkable .
this cost me $ _num_ right out of the gate .
this , in addition to the initial $ _num_ charge ) .
all for $ _num_ .
the towing business can be a dirty business full of jaded and shady characters .
andy 's really is that rare and honorable small operator .
here 's to you , andy !
and thank you !
wo n't go anywhere else for my future towing needs .
disclaimer : this is a review of sam 's cafe 's new evening menu .
all these problems melted away , however , when we tried sam 's .
even my middle eastern friend was impressed .
the baklava is the best i 've ever had .
i 'm thrilled that we found this place ; it is a treasure !
do not leave sam 's without trying the pancakes .
sounds a little creepy , but it 's true .
go support local business !
good lebanese food on thursday and friday nights .
the food was good though .
_num_ .
shish taok .
small chicken breast pieces , fried in a garlic sauce .
recommended .
_num_ .
kibbe .
i do n't recommend it .
a mixture of some sort and then fried , tasted strange .
_num_ .
kafta .
their main beef meal .
by far the best food they had .
very tasty .
_num_ .
falafel .
it was ok. nothing to brag about .
it was ok .
each meal comes with a choice of two meals .
we all got homous , and tabolli , both of them being delicious .
in fact , i think the homous was their best food !
btw , warm pita bread keeps coming , which was a nice touch .
they were friendly and nice people .
oh well , i ordered it anyway .
it was very good and piping hot .
they have a really good breakfast special .
it is cheap and good .
i love french toast , it is my favorite breakfast food .
sam 's is the epitome of a greasy spoon .
we each ordered a breakfast special and then split an order of french toast .
the french toast ?
ridiculous .
seriously , the best french toast i 've ever had .
it is rich , crispy and seasoned with powdered sugar and cinnamon .
it was a tasty breakfast on a cold , rainy day .
our total was about as pleasing as the french toast .
_num_ bucks and change for two coffees , two specials and french toast .
crazy cheap .
super cheap , tasty and quick .
sam 's is awesome for breakfast .
i have always wanted to try sam 's .
finally having a dentist appointment at _num_ am ( ick ! )
i like that about the place .
i know . )
the food was fast and good .
i wish i 'd tried a pancake , but i did n't this time .
i 'd go back again .
basically , it 's no-frills , straight up fast and cheap service .
and that 's refreshing .
: )
oh , and they do n't take cards .
bring cash .
it 's not like you 'll need a lot of it !
this is the breakfast place of my dreams !
two people , breakfast , less than $ _num_ !
i know , it 's not fancy .
now if it would only move toward urbana ...
but who cares about that ?
the food is phenomenal !
be served at a way fancier place for way more money .
what a cool place .
seriously .
it 's one of c-u 's little gems .
best value in town .
the food was great .
french toast is amazing !
bacon was fresh and the right balance of crispy without being overdone .
unpretentious , hole in the wall that is worth the drive .
cash only and bring change for the parking meters .
the french toast , oddly pancake style , is to die for .
also great to eat the ethnic food in the evening when available .
i 'm such a huge fan of hole-in-the-walls .
i have many regrets from my college career .
i get to experience two of my favorite words here : cheap brunch .
breakfast platter special for $ _num_ ? ? ?
fluffy french toast for under $ _num_ ? ? ? ?
pancakes ?
omelettes ! ! ! ? ?
oh yes please gim me nao i want it i want it so bad .
footnotes :
do not eat here if :
- you are on a diet .
i do n't think the cooks know what that word means .
no lite butter or diet fat free bacon to be found here .
- you are a snob .
- you are a germaphobe ... . but really , why would you be ?
snap out of it , take a class in immunology .
germs ai n't got nothin ' on you .
( sorry , bio nerd leaking through . )
do eat here if :
- you are a broke-ass college kid .
full meals for under $ _num_ ... how could you resist ?
- you love breakfast foods .
the french toast is particularly noteworthy .
it 's either _num_ or _num_ ... )
as good as a cheap and greasy breakfast gets .
very friendly staff , and it really feels like a neighborhood restaurant .
i 'll hopefully get a chance to go back for dinner .
i went here for breakfast and i was quite happy .
i had a bacon and cheese omelette and hash browns .
it was inexpensive and very tasty .
this is my favorite place for breakfast in champaign .
it is a comfort-food-greasy-spoon restaurant .
the food is very inexpensive and it has the best french toast in town .
the seats are quite uncomfortable but fit in with the ambiance .
for a while they served lebonese food on some evenings but stopped doing that .
i wish they would bring it back .
it was excellent , high quality and reasonably priced .
food is cheap , breakfast special is $ _num_ and it runs all day !
service was as quick as you can get and still have been freshly made !
i know i will be going again !
did you know the specials are here at the top ?
did you read what i wrote there ?
best .
damned .
french .
toast .
in .
the .
world .
how is it so good ?
that 's a good question .
your mug will always be full , for better or for worse .
there are better-for-us breakfasts in champaign .
there are fancier breakfasts in champaign .
good , cheap breakfast .
it was definitely pretty amazing .
delicious , and a perfect serving .
basically hash browns , they were delicious .
sounds disgusting ?
trust me , it 's awesome .
still , we were in and out within an hour .
the atmosphere is probably going to take a few visits to grow on me .
it felt cramped .
once we settled into our little nook i felt more comfortable .
and the food is indeed good .
great , even .
excellent service very honest waiter
looks can be deceiving , and sams cafe is a classic example of that .
sams is my favorite place for breakfast in chambana .
a big reason for that is the french toast .
it is simply the best i have every had .
wait staff is friendly and efficient .
sams is definitely a diamond in the rough .
it is a small crowded place serving inexpensive and ok food .
but i think it is over rated in yelp .
the best french toast you will ever eat ! !
!
i 'm a believer .
you 'll be glad you did .
prices are great , i think a burger is under $ _num_ !
i have never ordered anything other than french toast and hash browns .
the hash browns are darn good too .
side-note : they only take cash .
cheesiest omelette ever !
and it 's delicious melty american cheese , not oily coagulated cheddar .
and i swear these has browns are from scratch .
deeeeelicious !
this hole-in-the-wall was a great find .
service was fast and friendly , customers were a little gruff , but nice .
food was great for this greasy spoon .
we had t-bone steaks and french toast for breakfast .
small place , so i can imagine it fills up fast .
not a long wait for anything and reasonably priced .
best french toast in town !
!
so glad i remembered seeing yelp reviews of sam 's .
the american fries are great , as is the french toast .
the kids split an order of french toast and i had the breakfast special .
and all for just $ _num_ for all _num_ of us .
much ado about nothing .
have heard so much about sam 's cafe and now wonder why .
not the case here .
service was perfunctory but that could be owing to the place being so busy .
coffee was decent .
ordered the western omelet .
huge .
totally bland .
the american fries were a soggy mess and also without flavor .
blah ! !
did these reviewers eat the same stuff as i did ?
there was nothing remotely commendable about it .
it was soggy and relatively flavorless .
i tried it with and without syrup .
it 's been a while since i left that much food on my plate .
of course , if you disagree you are obviously declasse .
color me declasse .
but the thing i ca n't get over is the pancakes .
they are absolutely delicious .
plus , they have take out .
: )
do n't know what i ordered here but it was dirt cheap .
probably less than $ _num_ .
you get what you pay for but the food is cheap quick and easy .
there 's an _num_ % chance that sam could be serving you .
say hi .
i 'm definitely never going back .
wow .
greasy .
must be a southern thing .
no clue how this has _num_ stars .
french toast was hidden like a pancake .
we all agreed that it was fantastic and full of charm .
i ordered the ribeye and eggs breakfast with a half order of french toast .
i believe the owner dips the toast in pancake batter before frying it .
regardless of how its made , its wonderful .
go here , you wo n't regret it .
and if you do regret it , it 'll only cost a few bucks .
met sam as he was busy at the grill .
paul and i went in to order some burgers .
the staff was very attentive .
i borrowed a pen to start my food diary .
he is a very sweet man and his brother was just in from lebanon .
i noticed a saint perched above the grill .
he offtered to share one with me for protection .
he said i should place it above a door way of my home .
how cool is this guy anyway..
sam 's has the best pancakes i 've had in quite a while .
the coffee was really good too and my bacon and eggs were delicious .
my favorite breakfast place of all time here .
it 's your typical cafe , everything done the way you would want it .
do n't even bother with merry anns just come straight to sams .
they make everything to order ( duh ) .
sam and his family are some really hard working people and it shows .
you ca n't go wrong !
what more can you ask for ?
i 've heard the french toast and pancakes are also great .
any kind of breakfast to be had .
pancakes were my favorite !
the server was very friendly , and the food was brought out quickly .
i 'd highly recommend this place for a low-key diner-style breakfast .
environment is very shabby with some old chairs and tables .
but the price and the taste is amazing .
we two ppl ordered _num_ things .
huge pancakes , very good omelette and waffle too .
even the oj tastes different .
strongly recommend .
parking is kinda difficult sometimes and only takes cash .
we were completely disappointed and frustrated afterwards .
so we sat down and the service was just terrible .
he talked way too fast and barely gave us time to respond .
did n't like him at all .
ehhhhh !
it was edible , sure , but delicious ?
yeahhhh , no .
by the way , cash only !
* another problem we had here .
all i had was coffee cause i 'm not a huge breakfast kinda guy ...
but the coffee was awesome !
way better then your normal bottomless pot type diner coffee .
the rest of the gang ordered omelettes , and french toast and both looked superb..
friendly service though .
the biggest flaw of this place is the extremely slow wait times .
there seems to be only one cook .
that meant that we waited around fifty minutes for our food .
the staff is relatively amiable .
they talk about that customer as if she was in the wrong .
another problem are the extremely small tables .
its greatest strength are its really good prices .
their `` american '' fries is actually very soft hash browns .
this place is what it is .
a cheap greasy spoon dive with a cash only policy .
if that sounds repulsive to you , do n't go !
if not , go and definitely have the french toast .
service is ok at best but wth ?
it might look run down or old , but everything looked clean .
the server was nice and attentive .
very inexpensive too .
simple food but simply good too .
they have the best french toast .
my husband always ordered denver omelette where we were here .
the price is also very reasonable : )
everything including a milk for the daughter is $ _num_ with tip .
service is awesome - everyone is super-friendly .
for now , make sure you keep an andrew jackson on ya !
i was skeptical the french toast could be the best in the world .
not anymore though .
they were amazing , perfect and the best ive ever had .
sam 's cafe has great food at a reasonable price .
i have eaten there many of times and am always satisfied .
there famous french toast is my go to , must have breakfast meal .
they have great lunch specials with a great at home feeling atmosphere .
the only downside is that the seating is very small .
they have a good amount of tables but they are tiny .
there are two reasons to come to sam 's :
two , you want their breakfast special .
do your mouth a favor ( flavor ?
) , and order it .
i 'll make this one as easy as possible .
sam 's cafe serves good breakfast food at reasonable prices .
and they use real butter .
there is like one server/busboy/cashier and he is awesome .
love this place !
stopped through champaign on our way back to iowa from indiana .
whole family had breakfast .
every item ordered rocked !
french toast was unlike any i 've eaten ... was simply amazing !
have always gotten breakfast , and the food has been wonderful every time .
i recommend sam 's cafe !
great little greasy spoon here in champaign .
delicious and cheap pancakes .
only down side is they only take cash , no credit or debit
amazing breakfast !
good food .
inexpensive .
the breakfast special is worth the price as the portions are fairly large .
cheap and delicious .
try the french toast .
cheap .
but that is where it begins and ends .
sam 's cafe is super cute-looking from the outside .
but that 's where the good stops .
well , the waiter was really nice .
but other than those two things , i see no positives about this place .
seems like that could be a possibility seeing that this place has _num_ stars .
stood in there for twenty minutes before anyone noticed us .
four tables without people , all covered with plates and trash .
we were told it would be awhile because there were no tables .
incredibly rude , clearly do n't care for customers or loyalty .
will not be returning .
the wait person was prompt and friendly .
the food was just s bit too greasy and eggs were over cooked .
i do n't think we 'll be back .
really good value tasty breakfast/brunch .
the all day breakfast special is only $ _num_ !
nice place to meet with friends , friendly staff and nice atmosphere : - )
ok enough of the rant..
it was amazing , to say the least .
absolutely love this place !
coffee is always hot and fresh and the french toast is to die for !
a must try
every time i walk into sam 's i feel at home .
i hope it never closes .
true diner with good food at a very reasonable price .
traditional breakfast options and it wo n't kill the wallet .
sometimes getting back to basics can separate the good restaurants from the great restaurants .
this place is great .
simple .
breakfast .
food .
that serves breakfast .
it 's super fast and just great classic breakfast .
i ordered eggs , sausage and gus ' famous french toast .
word ! ?
!
yes , word .
this was the best tasting panfrench-cake toast i ever had .
it 's butter and has the crispy edges , clearly made with buttermilk .
they seem to soak it in butter with some maple syrup .
yes !
yes !
yeeeeessss !
one less point for being cash only .
service is pretty friendly .
they fixed a broken door handle on my car .
these guys are awesome .
and they delivered .
i highly recommend them .
great service !
they repaired the right side of my car which sustained multiple dents .
central il auto body did a wonderful job fixing my car .
i had extensive damage to the roof of my new toyota .
they replaced and repaired everything to perfect condition !
kept me informed through the entire process which was an added benefit .
great people and excellent service !
definitely recommended !
charlie at central il auto body was very courteous and thorough during my estimate .
i will take them at their word and assume that these delays were legitimate .
good service .
charlie is a very nice person .
highly recommended .
brought my mom 's car in .
i expected to pick it up the next day .
they had it ready to go in just over an hour .
thanks charlie .
my favorite c-u bar .
nice place - on campus , but without a heavy illini feel .
they cook excellent burgers and fries , and the teriyaki chicken sandwich is divine .
many beers on tap and knowledgable bartenders .
great irish pub right in the heart of campus !
the food is awesome too for bar food .
they have a great chicken sandwich with french fries .
add a tastey guiness to complete your meal !
very good bar , and an institution at the u of i .
they 've expanded so now there 's more room to groove .
great-tasting burgers .
best burger and fries in town , hands down !
the minimal bare acceptable campus bar for graduate student inhabitation .
but only on weeknights .
when there are no sporting events .
ohhhh the murphyburger , how i loved thee .
best damn burger in town .
the mushroom cheeseburger was my favorite , and the fries - oh .
so .
good .
extra pickles , please .
go murphy 's !
i still have dreams of wednesday lunch .
bacon mega cheeseburger and fries for $ _num_ .
i would give my left arm for a murphy burger on some days .
however , it is not .
the burgers are phenemonal , as is the bbq chicken .
this is my favorite bar on campus .
it is a solid pub where they serve cheap and delicious beer .
the food is decent , but not that great .
what could really improve this place is better music .
the jukebox is too susceptible to people with bad music tastes .
pros
-fairly good specials
-relatively low amount of bros
-greasy ass delicious food
cons
-seating is terrible on the weekends after _num_
-dirty looking , but not necessarily dirty .
go there on a weeknight to get the optimal experience .
honestly people do n't care about the atmosphere , do they ?
they just come for the booze .
they serve the typical junk food and it is very crowded during the weekends .
they have a few specials too , so do check those out .
and i 've had some of their deliciously fried , greasey appetizers , too .
an added bonus is they have photo hunt .
best campus bar .
food can actually be quite good , especially the kobe burger .
the crispy , but greasy , fries have slowly grown on me .
the beer selection is way better than any other bar on campus .
they now have some rogue ales , which are fantastic .
the jukebox churns out more and more horrifying music as people become intoxicated .
if you go here stick with weekdays .
on weekdays it 's actually a pretty nice place to hang out with friends .
can get very very crowded and absolutely nothing irish about it .
however , they were delicious .
their burgers made me real sick once but i got over it .
plus they have lots of seating for us lazies .
and have good , knowledgeable bartenders .
there 's a wide selection of beers - over _num_ i believe ?
some of the stuff that comes out of that thing ...
i do n't know , man ... =p
the specials here are also pretty sweet - yay for logo glass night .
overall , it 's just a great campus bar to frequent anytime .
a fine mid-day watering hole .
good beer specials , including $ _num_ pints of point on fridays .
the fries are thin and decent , but need salt and ketchup .
good soups in winter , including a deceptively good beer cheese soup .
check it out .
one of the better bars on campus .
great food during the day , good drink specials .
more casual than some of the other green st. bars .
cheap beers , and irish nachos are awesome .
a bar i spend a lot of time at .
sometimes the jukebox leads to very questionable music .
this is the best bar on green street .
i know that 's not saying much , but let me explain .
the drinks are cheap and really strong .
the staff is very accommodating and courteous .
one caveat : they have the nastiest -- nastiest bathroom .
it 's hideous .
ugh .
a year later and i still loooove this place .
got the turkey burger , yumm !
this is my favorite of all the campus bars hands down .
i ca n't even count all the great memories i 've made there .
in terms of food/drink , great fries , great specials on drinks .
( $ _num_ woodchuck thursdays ! )
they also have loaded waffle fries that are awesome .
nah , just kidding .
but i have been to my share of irish bars .
i like murphy 's because it 's low-key and they have good drink specials .
then refills of said beer are only _num_ !
pretty sick .
the next thing i 've got to try here is the food .
i 'll definitely be back .
murphy 's is the dive bar that we all kind of grew up on .
i will miss every night i 've remembered , or forgotten here .
one of the best bars in campustown ... . until friday and saturday nights .
most of the time its pretty relaxed and quiet .
they have decent burgers and a fair selection of beers .
i head to downtown champaign for the weekends .
in addition , the food is delicious !
best burgers and fries on campustown .
overall , this bar is chill and fun at the same time .
yesssss .
from drink specials ( $ _num_ woodchucks on thursdays ?
i 'm in ! )
the jukebox has some interesting selections , and the music is usually good overall .
well , it 's an institution here at the u of i .
you can get cheap brewskis and cheap burgers and neither are bad .
it 's usually crowded thursdays so i try to keep away .
as far as campus bars go , this is as good as it gets .
their beers on tap is great , especially for a campus bar .
it 's really fresh !
first of all , i already mentioned their beer on tap .
it 's quality and fresh !
and low cost .
secondly , their burgers still rock in an awesome way !
i had their turkey burger while my friends had the regular cheeseburgers .
man oh man these burgers are juicy and seculent .
the turkey burger is well flavored and succulent .
we basically scarfed down our meals including the yummy fries .
i love their spacious bench seat tables .
if you 're visiting u of i , definitely hit up this place !
it 's a cherished favorite .
the best bar on campus .
hands down .
the location is great and the atmosphere is better than the other campus bars .
the late afternoon and evening hours will be a little louder .
hands down , one of my favorite places .
is it the best bar in champaign-urbana ?
the beers on tap are always good and remain pretty simple .
they always have specials too , which is nice .
i miss this place !
this is my choice for a beer and greasy pub-grub .
i sincerely doubt it did anything about the disgusting sticky floors .
ca n't beat wednesday night - bacon mega cheeseburger special night .
usually good fries , and the standard drinks .
a campus tradition , with all kinds of stuff carved into the booths .
i was in champaign last week , on a wednesday evening .
murphy 's was the only place with their kitchen open after 10pm .
i ordered a mega bacon cheeseburger and fries .
service here was terrible .
the burger ?
much smaller than i remember .
all in all , a terrible meal .
nothing really special .
its a college bar in a college town .
i mean the place is n't exactly set up like panera .
nevertheless , i was okay with my fish sandwich .
big fan of this place .
i guess it just depends on the crowd .
ca n't really state how much i love this place .
it 's generally quiet enough for that during the week .
on weekends it 's certainly busier and louder , but not unpalatable .
if you are here for food , try the irish nachos .
absolutely brilliant .
i 'm a fan of this place .
murphy 's pub really is a great college bar .
the drink specials are quite good and the choices on tap are plentiful .
food is good for bar food , definitely get the irish nachos sometime .
there really is n't anything irish about them , but they are delicious .
perfect for a burger , fry and beer .
you ca n't go wrong .
fries are great !
they have great drink deals and good food too .
i recommend trying the irish nachos .
they have different specials everyday too .
either way , that was a bit annoying , so strike two .
the good news is their food is amazing .
the murph !
great atmosphere and so many memories .
really murphy 's ? ? ?
why do you have such stars ?
what i was served was a ridiculously gross , flavorless hockey puck .
i will never come back to this place of my own free will .
so , thanks , but no thanks murphy 's .
folks , i highly advise you to pass this place up .
good irish stout .
super-hipster-artsy .
friendly staff .
i have nothing but the fondest memories of murphy 's pub .
a fun yet relaxing college night , murphy 's is the place for you !
irish nachos come in huge servings .
it 's all good , but not really outstanding .
sometimes it 's great and there are n't any problems .
but if it 's crowded things quickly go downhill from there .
the first rating was over-generous .
it 's still good , but three stars seem more appropriate than four .
the food at murphys is solid .
the best nights at murphy 's are wednesdays and thursdays .
phenomenal deal .
my cabinets are full of awesome logo glasses thanks to murphy 's .
thursdays are phenomenal because it 's $ _num_ pints .
any pint for just $ _num_ .
you 'll never beat that .
go out with a $ _num_ bill and you 'll have an awesome night .
that simple , that 's all you need .
they have great drink specials and amazing irish nachos !
this is definitely the best bar on campus , hands down .
good times from college , my favorite bar in the area .
drinks will be the cheapest compared to everywhere else in the area .
food is pretty good but sometimes its hit and miss .
i 've had great irish nachos and i 've had terrible irish nachos there .
service is terrible they are incredibly rude .
1st example
2nd example
crowded for unofficial so i 'm sure they are stressed .
still reaching for my wallet bartender looks at _num_ dollar tab with no tip .
3rd example
usually the irish nachos are covered in toppings , most recent time hardly any .
can i get some more toppings please i did n't get very much .
guy looks at me like i just punched his mother .
answers slowly `` yeah ... i guess i can '' .
he was pissed .
thank god i love this place .
except the servers .
and not all are bad , just most .
good times with friends and cheap beers , and that 's pretty much it .
the irish nachos is good to order with two more people .
however , the memories make the place and thats pretty much how murphys survives .
ah , murphys .
the one place where townies , undergrads and graduate students actually mingle .
the food is pretty good for campustown ; i like the burgers and fries .
what you go to murphys for is the beer .
and it 's not bad beer either .
one of my favorite places to have a beer in champaign .
usually good drink specials and a good juke box .
irish nachos are a must if you 're hungry !
this is the best bar on campus .
i love murphy 's !
it has a great campus bar feel .
its a perfect location for campus for in between classes .
a beer for everyone here because their draft list is extensive .
my bartender was helpful and super nice !
used to go before we hit the club .
nice to have a large group and sit down and shout out conversations .
i remembered thursday is like an unofficial international day .
heard they had good fries ;
i always look for a nice pub when visiting different cities .
i even tried to get a convo going ...
customer service is what will make you $ $ $ .
and that 's a good thing .
murphy 's keeps things simple , cheap and fun .
i love watching drunk freshman share the plate of irish nachos , absolutely hilarious .
burgers are great , beers good enough for a campus bar .
exactly what you expect .
food was cold .
almost broke a tooth on a french fry .
no table service .
place was dirty .
do you get the idea it was bad ?
skip it and save yourself a possible trip to the dentist .
nice bar to grab food and a beer at .
service from bartenders is mediocre .
atmosphere is irish-feeling but feels kinda meh
nice selection of beer and they have green line on tap !
cheap prices and a cool divey feel .
date of original review : 09/11/2014
*based off of visits from august _num_ - may _num_
the food and drink selections are great and fairly priced .
_num_ stars for tradition , _num_ stars for food quality and _num_ for service .
the female bartender that took our lunch order had zero personality .
they make you pay up front for your food .
i 'm glad it was n't a problem .
i 'd recommend drinking here at night , but not eating .
dropped in on a saturday afternoon and the place was empty .
we looked at the menu and standard bar food nothing different than others .
being saturday and plenty of college games on but just not happening here .
most likely a lively place later and could be decent to hang .
just did not work this time .
what a shit hole !
it was almost _num_ in the afternoon and i sat at a pub table .
my sleeve got stuck to the table .
a voice came from behind the bar that said .
i got up and grabbed a couple menu 's .
looked it over and said .
let 's go , i 've seen enough .
i will only pass thru college towns from now on !
a great place to have a good beer .
and you must try the irish nachos if you go there .
some reviewers seem not to like ordering at the bar .
boo hoo it 's not like a long walk .
classic campus bar .
very standard bar .
beer deals are decent and pub food is very standard .
the bar is huge however , good to bring a big group .
solid burger and fries for cheap .
good beer selection for campus town and reasonably priced .
overall , i like murphys .
the loudspeaker announcements though are just really annoying .
atmosphere : disgusting and not aesthetically pleasing .
lots of vandalized light wood .
it smells like dick cheese in here mixed with vomit and under dried towels .
i do not understand how this bar continues to exist .
they use gigantic glasses of mixer with a single standard shot .
i was stunned .
_num_ fl oz for a shot is the next level of low .
but _num_ just leaves me speechless .
standard shot , you guys , is _num_ fl oz .
that 's basically spiked sprite .
my point is , they have _num_ drink craftsmanship .
which is fine since apparently you 're supposed to lower your standards on campus .
food : food service is poor though the food is fairly good .
we waited an unusually long time for two burgers .
i get it ...
if i were working all night i 'd get hungry too .
thanks murphys !
eh , this place was alright .
these were a rendition of the cheese curd but a very sub par one .
next off , i had the burger .
i ordered the mushroom burger which was the tuesday special .
the fries were mediocre at best .
oh man , this is a classic college dive bar .
i was here on business and decided to stop in for a drink .
what a deal !
a few people in the group ordered food and said it was n't bad .
i can not vouch or review the food as i did not partake .
from seeing the burgers , they looked pretty decent actually .
the process of ordering food was interesting .
there are no servers .
they then call your name over a pa system to the whole bar .
all in all this place is a dive .
if you want this type of thing , go for it !
five stars is probably due to some heavy nostalgia sentiment for me .
always had a great time .
beyond that , they have delicious burgers and fries .
and it 's a more laid back alternative to kam 's or red lion .
murphy 's will always be a memorable place for this illinois alum .
great reputation on campus , but not the most comfortable bar .
good deals .
a bit crowded .
still a good memory of being where my first legal us drink was .
great owner .
solid pub .
food is exactly what would you expect from this place .
absolutely a classic for champaign- urbana and u of i students .
but , for what it is ?
perfect .
it 's a heart attack waiting to happen so do n't order it alone .
it 's like an irish-style pub , lots of dark furniture and seating areas .
the only thing i was n't too happy about was the service .
it was quite slow .
it seemed like they were a little understaffed .
either way , a good time and i 'll definitely be back .
great bar for hanging out with colleagues .
lots of space in this place , even on a saturday night .
bar tenders were super cool and friendly .
awesome service and good prices for whatever domestics were on tap .
there still killing the irish nachos .
a great local dive bar .
the place is interesting and has a comfortable low key feel .
my kind of place .
they have _num_ beers on tap as i recall , pbr and high life .
huber 's ' pizza is way better .
for two days i wondered how i burned my mouth .
service is great , and friendly .
i can definitely see this as a place to go back to .
the brass rail is what a dive bar should be .
every time i 've come i 've enjoyed it .
old school dive bar here .
long bar , with wood booths .
several bar games and an internet jukebox .
typical beer selection for such a place .
cheap hamn 's ( really , that is awesome ) and pabst .
along with a full bar .
they can make cheep frozen pizzas if you are really desperate for some food .
the place has been here forever , and it has not been updated either .
no pretension here , and just bare bones .
if that is your thing , this is right up your ally .
the selection of alcohol is pretty good .
plus the bartender was friendly and the specials were pretty good .
why am i writing a review about my favorite bar ?
did they read reviews and decide to show up ?
oh shit ...
i '' m becoming part of the problem .
well.. the deal is the rail is the shit .
and the owner is n't trying to become some tycoon .
he 's a pretty sweet older dude .
this is what rocks .
the beers pour nicely .
the booze is mighty fine .
no redbull or credit card jerkasses .
this is to keep things real .
are you kinda chill , a bit outside the box ?
stop in .
are you a douche ?
eh , you still deserve a shot of fireball ... then leave .
the brass rail is a diaper .
i always end up being dragged here and i do n't know why !
the beer selection & seating are virtually non existent .
oh yeah , cash only and do n't expect much help from the bartender .
and i love that .
the rail ... .best dang place .
the older i get , the less i want to deal with people .
i am officially red from that 70s show .
on cheap beer .
who does n't love cheap beer ?
i mean ... .common sense , right ?
anyway , very few beer selections but who cares .
you do n't go to the rail to be super snazzy .
it 's literally the epitome of the dive bar .
so take it as it is and stop complaining .
jukebox etiquette people .
jukebox etiquette .
you 've got your regulars and they are all amazing .
i had the gypsy skillet and i thought it was dry .
the flavor was good for the most part .
the onions were overwhelming and there were too many potatoes and not enough mushrooms .
i also asked for my eggs to not be runny and they were .
in a skillet that can be gross .
i only gave them two stars because that is what i truly feel .
i might change my mind when and if i go back again .
overall , i like !
we were super hungry initially , but omg were we stuffed afterwards !
same deal with the french toast .
definitely a good brunch place for when you 're really hungry !
mmmmmm .
which was so great !
very fresh and tasty .
not to mention filling .
they had a wide variety of dishes , and many healthy options .
my only complaint was the `` fresh squeezed '' orange juice .
le peep is a solid breakfast/brunch spot , especially for champaign .
their menu has a nice variety , but nothing too exciting .
this is central illinois , after all .
the biggest difference between la brunch and champaign brunch ?
grease .
those midwesterners love their grease .
i have to say , i was pleasantly surprised by le peep 's brunch .
) , and i was really happy with my granola blueberry pancakes .
sounds strange , but what a great idea to put granola in/on pancakes !
i 'd definitely return to le peep in the future .
otherwise , i ca n't complain .
have always had a good experience and their food is delicious !
by far the best breakfast in town .
they also make wonderful smoothies .
their classic cubed potatoes are very very good .
their gypsy plate is fantastic .
however , there are things to improve on that need attention .
he was n't so friendly and he cut us off while talking .
today i went and got their seafood crepes for $ _num_ .
the dish says it is stuffed with seafood ... a total lie .
gross !
you can get it under $ _num_ at walmart !
we left and i am not sure i will be returning .
i used to frequent le peep .
it 's reliable food , but nothing great or special .
that was so generous of her .
i answered no .
she asked the same question to the lady behind me that paid .
i wo n't be returning .
this breakfast spot had big shoes to fill .
the le peep up near northwestern was one of my favorites .
you can also get flavored coffee , though with a few less options .
i went for the irish benedict and a cafe mocha .
better than ihop by far .
basic good food .
i had the ham melt without mushroom and tomato .
that 's just what i got .
my husband got the denver skillet ( $ _num_ ) .
i tried the potatoes in it and they were good .
i had the raz ma taz smoothie and it was great .
we had a coupon so it was worth the visit .
le peep is mario from super mario bros. _num_ .
that is why i never go back to le peep .
hearty breakfast place .
no gimmicks .
my favorite breakfast spot .
i love getting skillets for breakfast and the ultimate blt for lunch .
breakfasted at lepeep on saturday .
service was good .
the pancake special sounded delicious : bacon and pecan .
ordered one .
it was okay .
the `` signature '' potatoes were dry and a paltry serving .
as i said , food was mediocre .
wo n't try it again .
it 's pretty good , i have to say .
?
their sausage is also much better .
food is awesome !
french toast and peasant potatoes are delish !
best breakfast place in c-u .
do n't know why this joint is n't getting more love .
put that hollandaise sauce on my eggs ... .right now
great coffee .
one of my favorites for breakfast or brunch .
friendly service , good food , and fair prices .
their menu is huge and everyone i was with enjoyed their food .
visited le peep yesterday ( 5/2/2012 ) .
both i and my guest experienced marvelous food .
pictures of both were taken and uploaded .
hers looked fantastic .
my omelette was excellent .
light and fluffy .
melty cheese that was great .
and the ham was great .
i tend to like my ham chunks to be more substantial ...
it did n't take anything away from the omelette at all .
we were treated like royalty .
no complaints .
_num_ stars .
i took my best buddy here for breakfast today .
i figured i 'd give the chambana le peep a whirl .
the menu is extensive .
maybe a little overwhelming .
i find the less things on the menu , the better the food .
( concentrate your excellence , restaurants of the world ! )
i ordered the `` wheat '' pancakes .
substitutions are not a part of the extensive menu .
our food came rather quickly for a sunday morning .
they were in fact regular old un-nutritious pancakes with wheat germ delicately sprinkled atop .
sigh .
the potatoes were okay .
my friend said her meal was alright .
nothing special , but nothing to really complain about .
the waitress was nice and attentive .
she made sure our drinks were never empty and she was pleasant .
would i return ?
maybe .
maybe not .
had the seafarer !
yum !
good breakfast place after a party at a college town !
nothing bad , nothing great .
breakfast , an omelet , was very average and the service was fair .
being a chain le peep is a know quantity and reliable .
reliable , as in average .
not bad for a chain .
wait staff was pretty good and friendly .
there was a _num_ min wait which in my opinion was not bad .
what breakfast brunch place does n't have a wait on sundays anyways .
everything sounded tasty .
it did n't disappoint .
upon delivery it was piping hot and visually pleasant .
each bite was good mmmm good .
definitely suggest this place for anyone in need of a good meal .
that 's when people go out for brunch !
the irish benedict is amazing .
ca n't beat it .
my brunch motto is : everything with hollandaise sauce , hollandaise sauce with everything .
coffee is kept fresh and warm .
a great place for breakfast or brunch in the champaign-urbana area !
the food quality is not that great .
champaign breakfast gem .
i personally get the eighteen wheeler - a lot for a good price .
& i like french toast .
they have amazing pancakes and omelettes/skillets .
the menu was extensive but what i ordered was nothing special .
had breakfast here today and the food was delicious .
i had french toast and it was very tasty .
the bathrooms were very clean .
they serve breakfast , brunch , and lunch .
they do n't serve dinner .
good but not great .
ordered the fruit cakes & they were totally uninspired .
not so many breakfast places in champaign so it is what it is .
le peep is n't that place .
it fits well in the category of mediocre breakfast restaurants in champaign .
i 'm still searching for an exceptional breakfast expericence .
wish i had found this place sooner .
not as good as the indiana locations .
service was a tad slow .
but breakfast is breakfast .
i was with four others , and we all ordered something different .
best breakfast in c-u and reasonable price .
waits on weekend after maybe _num_ .
cheese eggs are great !
i think you 're either a le peep groupie or you 're not .
i 'm not .
i 'll go there , and their food is alright , but nothing special .
decent breakfast food .
yum but it was _num_ % potatoes .
coworker had something hollandaise and said it was average .
pancakes are average .
service is quick and friendly though .
it 's a good find for breakfast in this small town .
had a bit of a wait -- went around 11am on a weekend .
flavored coffee was awesome .
the french toast was above average .
great french toast , very filling and tasty .
also tried the garden omelette which was very light and also delicious .
unfortunately the coffee was sub par , but most diner coffees are .
decent food , but not breathtaking .
service was excellent , and prices were also very good .
i 'd consider coming back to try something else .
hearing only good things about this place , i had relatively high expectations .
and long behold , this place does not disappoint .
i first ordered a strawberry creme smoothie .
it came in a chilled glass mug .
upon first sip , i could taste the strawberries .
not many restaurants can do that .
the food was served within 10-15 minutes .
and dear god , did the combination of both hit the spot !
the waiter/waitresses were very attentive .
the best part about this place is probably the price .
they messed it up .
also , there is nothing french about their omelettes .
i have n't tried the crepes so i ca n't give my opinion .
not so good :
underwhelming flavor .
the eggs really need the hollandaise which is so unhealthy .
it 's quite an alright breakfast place .
it 's just a regular pancake house with better food quality .
i think the food is reasonably priced and the service was always good .
i always order the blarney skillet with hollandaise sauce on the side .
the hollandaise sauce is actually the highlight of my meal !
basically anything from the skillet section is amazing .
expect ~30 mins wait on sunday !
when a younger man , i did n't care for le peep .
well , some _num_ years later i tried le peep again .
holy cow , they have excellent food !
my personal fav is the blarney skillet sans peppers and onions .
it is the absolute bomb .
wait staff is friendly .
service is excellent .
i am back , and incredibly happy to be back !
our family 's `` go-to '' place for breakfast and lunch !
yummy food and excellent customer service !
i want to like le peep , i really do .
it just seems every time i go , something is n't right .
so on saturday i ordered the la petit french toast .
this was more like 'heated bread ' .
these reminded me of pancakes at ihop : bland tasting black holes for syrup .
another reviewer said lp is like pancake house only more expensive .
and such thing happened for two times already !
so mad .
oh my god .
this is one of the best breakfast places i 've ever been been to .
their food is seriously yummy .
but the concept is very interesting .
it looks like a quaint kitchen , possibly decorated by your blind grandmother .
green walls , light wood , valances , art nouveau posters .
like , real ugly .
looks are n't everything .
all phenomenal .
i had no idea gravy could be that good .
they really know how to make a good skillet .
this is a solid low price breakfast place .
i like the mini omelets .
good service and good food .
this is one of my favorite weekend breakfast stops .
the food is always top notch .
the eggs benedict is one of the best i 've had in town .
service is fast and friendly .
you never feel rushed .
but get there early , the place fills up fast and stays busy !
always a pleasant experience at le peeps !
the staff are overly friendly and bring a smile everytime !
food is is always delicious !
the best breakfast place in cu .
always had eggs benedict .
and they serve food fast .
sometimes i was craving for their french toast
originally i would have given this place _num_ or _num_ stars .
i 'd also get the potatos or side sald .
however , i 've had additional health problems and have identified more food allergies/triggers .
the potatoes are prepackaged and seasoned with onion powder .
onions have been identified as my biggest allergy .
i asked if i could have a side salad with extra veggies .
i was told no to every possibility i came up with .
the server seemed annoyed and did n't assist me with any other options .
i ended up with _num_ eggs and a bowl of plain oatmeal .
i know with allergies/food triggers , we can be annoying customers .
good breakfast overall .
the food is usually very good and the service is excellent .
got the down home county pie more like down home delicious brunch ! ! !
le peep be mine # wcw
definitely a nice little breakfast place with delicious food .
i would recommend this place .
best seafood omelet ever .
good service .
love having a water pitcher at the table .
nice , clean , just the right level of ambient music .
good breakfast place , but not as good as courier cafe in my opinion !
my spinnaker omelet was good , just met expectations .
huevos rancheros were a scramble , not the usual presentation of eggs easy over .
no rice or beans either .
still tasty though .
my daughter in law said its really just a fancy denny 's .
pretty good analogy !
service was fast .
good breakfast place , not spectacular .
i ordered the eggs benedict , and was not at all disappointed .
there was even hot sauce already on the table !
the berry compote was nice and the sour cream was a fun touch .
would i go again ?
in a heart beat !
and bring several friends with me !
i 've never met a bad wait-staff or hostess here .
also , grab a glass of the raw cider .
it 's intense .
absolutely love le peep
the staff is friendly , but i just expect better food for the price .
absolutely amazing !
tons of bacon ! ! ! !
phenomenal !
the food was edible , and the restaurant was clean and bright .
blueberries , and a little sliver of strawberry ) .
came with a group of _num_ with no reservation .
it was busy but we were seated within _num_ minutes .
the menu has a wide variety of breakfast foods .
i went with the stuffed french toast .
they have a flavor of the day and it was chocolate hazelnut .
the eggs were good and the fruit was fresh .
only checkout was that check out was a bit chaotic .
very friendly staff and excellent food .
pecan coffee was a nice added touch .
sir benedict omelet was delicious .
absolutely amazing .
the shamrock eggs benedict was a 10/10 .
ahh , le peep .
for the very traditional , the very local , and the very elderly .
first impression : ho'dang that is a lot of food !
the potatoes were n't bad , despite being a little overcooked and salty .
eggs and sausage , pretty standard stuff .
the stuffed french toast is amazing .
with a creamy ricotta filling , of a different flavor every time .
this time i had the raspberry flavour .
it was amazing .
service is okay .
overall , not great , but not a place that needs avoiding .
great place to have breakfast .
nice service .
delish food .
only issue i had was no bike parking .
i love cooking but once in a while i crave for breakfast in bed..
he must be really excited i guess ; ) .
i usually like to decide my menu beforehand .
so , i went to their website and selected two options .
we arrived around _num_ on friday and were quickly seated .
but , then came a surprise .
the items mentioned on website were not their on menu .
my anxiety level was high , as i hate when my plan fails .
i loved both .
but now since i have gone many times , i have taken a few .
all of them were great
le peep is one of the best forgotten restaurants in champaign .
try the wanderer skillet !
i 'd give this place 6/5 stars if i could !
la peep does everything right .
they have gourmet dessert coffees and brewed coffee specials that change daily .
they even offer you a coffee to take home when you leave !
the waitstaff is always friendly , knowledgeable , and pleasant .
our waitress molly was especially so .
: )
now , the food .
people often say `` everything i 've ordered from here has been good . ''
well , everything i 've ever had at la peep has been fantastic .
the presentation is spotless .
every plate is beautiful .
and the flavor !
they 've never messed up my eggs .
also the bacon and sausages are huge and will satisfy any meat lover .
basically , la peep is the perfect brunch spot .
i love it , and hopefully you will too .
this place is awesome .
this is my new favorite place in the cu area .
i got the banana walnut pancakes with a side of links and eggs .
this are the best pancakes that i ever had !
there breakfast is great , low price with tons of food , nice food .
we tried omelette , egg benedict and pasta .
all are nice , especially the omelette , enough soft egg flavor .
very disappointed in the gravy .
tasted like canned .
very good service and wonderful atmosphere
this is the real deal - a little italy in itself .
romantic , a popular valentine 's day destination .
one of our favorite places in champaign .
i love the chicken capperi - the wine sauce is incredibly delicious .
nice service .
save room for dessert .
an acceptable little itali-american place .
a good classic italian spot , but hardly anything special .
prices are good , food 's good .
everything 's good .
but nothing 's great .
i ordered the linguine with white clam sauce .
all i want are fresh ingredients , toothsome pasta , and freshly-grated parmigiano-reggiano ...
ana 's review is spot-on .
only the fact that this place is so cheap keeps it afloat .
i love manzella 's !
in addition , the prices are very reasonable and the staff is really friendly !
i usually take at least 1/2 of it home for later .
the pizza is awesome too !
the food and service are great and consistent !
: )
ps : for those cold , snowy nights , they also deliver !
food was overpriced and not that great .
slow service would n't even refill my drink .
interior is dingy and the tables were sticky i would not recommend this place .
the portions are big but are slightly pricey .
i loooooove this place !
very nice with a cute , homey , warm , dining room .
always nice friendly service .
love the ranch salad dressing !
everything on the menu is yummy .
i usually get the cheese filled ravioli and they are superb !
bread served with oil and parmesan cheese .
i have never had a bad meal or experience here .
my boyfriend and i love it .
went here with my girlfriend .
we both agreed it was good not great .
food is about what you 'd expect from a central illinois italian restaurant .
i 'd really say its about _num_ stars .
it was n't horrible but it was definitely forgettable .
the place smells dirty .
greasy old restaurant carpeting dirty .
the decor is 70s kitschy , and that 's okay .
i thought the prices were high for the food quality .
$ _num_ for spaghetti ?
really ?
the tomato gravy was okay .
thick and sweet .
it would be good on pizza .
( i had the baked lasagna . )
when we arrived it was n't busy , but the service was sub par .
then the restaurant filled up and the service was non-existent .
but frankly , next time , i 'll go to the olive garden .
amazing lasagna with terrific atmosphere .
my family has been coming here for years .
i remember having my little league banquet here when i was _num_ or _num_ .
this place has not been updated since the _num_ 's , and it shows .
still surprisingly welcoming after all these years .
the service is fast and friendly .
food comes out quick as well .
manicotti is bland , except for the overly sweet sauce .
for an app we had fried ravioli .
which was ok .
the pizza , again ok. an overly garlicy crust .
canned sardines , the pasta is probably not freshly made .
an average wine list , crap beer list .
saying all that , this place still has a special place in my heart .
though i wish dom 's was still open ...
get the italian beef sandwiches
this place is ahh mazing ! !
the boy eddie that works there is so sweet and nice and cute .
had lunch there on a rainy day .
the light was dark so i did not enjoy eating there .
the food was just so-so .
no much choice on the menu .
do n't know if they had another menu for dinner .
restaurant has n't changed in more than thirty years and is very dated .
the food is generally good , and service is average .
all in all i do n't know what we will ever go back .
i am in hopes the owners eventually make me want to return .
and i love it .
everything on the menu is delicious and the service is usually very good .
the meatball sandwich is great too .
we had to ask for water , which did n't come until much later .
nope .
we finally asked for and were given exactly one slice of bread each .
ok , let 's talk about the meal .
that just is n't possible ! ''
um , why would that be , exactly ?
but , ok , message loudly and clearly received .
i picked the spaghettini and added meatballs .
they were t exactly busy but , ok , whatever .
so then the bill comes .
my daughter-in-law had asked for alfredo sauce to be substituted on her pasta dish .
then , i looked at the bill .
sadly , none of that is true now .
wonderful italian beef sandwich .
loved the minestrone soup .
friendly atmosphere and waitresses was cute as a button .
nice relaxed menswear store .
moderate prices ... so you wo n't see any kiton or zegna or anything .
i had a short-notice interview and i needed a suit that day .
i 'd always noticed this place downtown , so i stopped in .
the salesman was really great .
he even set me up with an appointment to get the suit altered .
i do n't know much about suits , but i liked this place .
for that i give them _num_ stars .
this is a very old-fashioned menswear store .
suits , sweaters , pants , etc . )
they have regular sales on most or all of their items , including suits .
the staff are knowledgeable and will help you with whatever you need .
i have purchased items as gifts and my fiance has bought some suits here .
when it comes to customer service , perhaps they need a refresher course .
such a cute store , with a really great vibe .
they also have a small table of fair-trade coffees and chocolates .
it is a cute little store with very unique items .
with the infrequency of my visits , the stock changes quite a bit .
yesterday i bought two stupendous greeting cards just because i liked them .
as a result the prices are fairly high .
cool stuff and helping the world be a cooler place , two thumbs up !
worth a stop in .
i really kind of liked this little store .
nicely organized .
did n't feel too cramped like some stores .
big selection .
: )
fair trade offerings make unique gifts .
this is akin to grassroots in anchorage .
i had a lovely time browsing & found some beautiful jewellery .
around christmas , there are so many beautiful , handmade decorations .
additionally , they treat female customers with respect .
i can not recommend this business enough .
great place to get a quick oil change .
priced competitively with other major chains .
highly recommended !
i came here from another oil change place that i was n't happy with .
they were nice and honest to me .
i had a very pleasant experience .
and the oil change literally took _num_ min .
: )
very nice on the phone and in-person .
cool shop , too , as far as oil change places go : )
get in , get out .
no complaints .
really took 10-20 min for full fluid change for nice price .
very quick , good service at a reasonable price .
no problems here .
i 'll definitely be back next time i 'm due for an oil change .
highly recommend !
great place to get a quick oil change .
they 're always friendly and always very quick with what you have them do .
i 'm pretty good at that game , so they are really quick .
i went here based on the good reviews and was not disappointed !
i will definitely be coming here again .
best oil change service ever !
super fast !
the manager is very knowledgeable and the stuff clean my car like new !
highly recommend !
i 've come here now _num_ times .
the service here is great .
no bs they do what you ask and not try to up sell stuff .
i stopped going to jiffylube because of this .
plus there is never a line and they are quick .
dom 's has been around for years .
not in the olive garden kinda way .
yah , ya got ta love it .
stick with any of the meaty pasta dishes .
dom 's is far superior to many of the other italian restaurants in town .
word .
too bad you missed it .
dom 's has closed ?
noooo !
aaaagh !
you 're killing me !
does anyone have their recipes ?
oh , please .
i 've seen similar recipes from other restaurants but they were never even close .
please excuse me now while i gnash my teeth and rend sackcloth .
an old-school place that has now closed .
so keep an eye out for butitta 's !
woo !
great local florist .
they have beautiful arrangements at fair prices .
very friendly and helpful staff .
hours are 9-5 m , w-sat .
closed sunday and tuesday .
i never saw any of the arrangements i 've ordered .
now we 're married .
sweet .
this shop is closed .
do n't bother the nice man that now has the number ; )
went in at midnight on a saturday , and the place was mostly empty .
so it 's a draw .
not great , but not a nightmare either .
it 's weird..
even though no one else likes this place..
i 'm a big fan !
can we say cheap but super yummy mojitos ?
and a nice ambiance for a saturday night !
how awesome is that ?
barfly makes no sense .
i mean , who are you trying to attract ?
are you trying to get the pseudo-cosmopolitan crowd that drink classy martinis ?
the frat bros ?
the townies trying to look elegant ?
disaffected grad students with afros ?
i 'll still give you another try , b-fly .
the drinks are great .
it 's closed !
thank goodness !
it was disgusting .
needless to say , we warned the next people who attempted to sit there .
gallo miller 's people are friendly , knowledgeable , and helpful .
better still , their work is excellent .
and my car looks like new .
they are booked several weeks out , but worth the wait if you can .
it is obvious that they really care about the customer , how refreshing ! !
the staff kept me updated every step of the way .
i was wrong they are awesome .
super fast considering they replace the whole passenger side of my car ...
great job , and thank you gallo-miller .
friendly service worked hard to make things write on my crashed van .
that is what i wanted , and it 's what they delivered .
it did take them awhile to get it fixed .
several days in a row i got phone calls indicating `` probably tomorrow . ''
i would go there again .
dear franchisee ,
where the hell was the mayo or ketchup or water-laden lettuce and tomato ?
as is , that there burger is lethal , my friend .
stick with your fabulous ( and moist ) thickburgers .
please .
i 've never eaten at hardee 's .
i 've been to hardee 's twice .
they told me they were out of chicken tenders ( ? )
so i 'd have to order something else .
pass .
i 've been avoiding it ever since .
yesterday , boyfriend and friends wanted hardee 's .
boyfriend finishes eating basically as soon as i sit down .
this is normal .
friend a finishes his burger about five minutes later .
still no sign of my food .
friend b finishes her meal .
by now it 's been ten minutes .
hmm .
i check my receipt .
it 's been fifteen minutes .
my friends need to get back to work .
i flag down the next passing employee , who happens to be the manager .
i ask him what had happened to my food .
manager disappears , comes back three or so minutes later .
no .
i tell him to cancel my order and give me a refund .
maybe ! ''
i really love the taco bell on neil .
horrible wait in the drive-thru for food , discourteous staff .
i asked for ranch dressing .
the drive through wait was longer than i had expected but not the worst .
she said she was just checking to be sure they were there .
clearly the person lied about putting it in the bag .
!
aside from not having any dressing the salad itself is warm .
i prefer a crisp cold salad like most people .
however , the ring of onion on it is very hot .
whew ! !
this hardee 's always has nice staff well whenever i have been there .
restaurant review
it was effortless to order because there was no line .
from my vantage point i question the cleanliness of this restaurant .
this made me nervous with how dirty the restaurant was ...
overall the booth 's were simply sticky .
the fries were fresh though .
overall this was my first and last experience with hardee 's .
thank you .
pro : angus thick burger , a step above mcd but still not restaurant quality
cons : dirty store ( bugs , a room that was flooded ... )

their chicken tenders are off the hook .
i only drive through and i 've found the service to be consistently good .
worst customer service ever !
insert rude attitude !
the worst i never had a problem with this in the past .
if they had run out would n't just put a sign up ?
nope just to lazy to change it .
as well no napkins in dining room at all !
nelson , was that the hardee 's on bradley ?
we had some bad cleanliness issues there years ago .
that also had only one car ... this is a litltle after _num_ pm .
but i went in .
the shop was clean & the staff were polite but not overly so .
the sauce was sticky but that 's why god created napkins .
i like that they fries were cut unpeeled .
so-so but ok. good fast food at a good price .
i 'd say this place is pretty hipster .
but i still love it .
all the beers .
all the liquor .
the excellent beer garden .
the good tunes .
the creepy room upstairs for shows .
cheers !
and i always get sad because it is so gross in there .
even downstairs .
none of these other reviews do justice to this bar .
this is the best spot in downtown champaign overall .
blind pig has more character and better drinks .
but historically , mike murphy has the goods .
the place is not filthy , it 's just not clean .
it 's not meant to be clean .
not even in the realm .
this place is grand .
it would n't be described as `` posh '' or `` immaculate . ''
( what 's on then anyway ?
ping pong ?
curling ? )
makes up for the cheap beer , i guess .
nice , off-the-beaten path spot .
awesome beer garden .
nothing beats it on a summer night with a group of friends .
mike & molly 's is my home base in champaign .
and then there is the music .
the beer prices are on the wall , so they stay the same .
it means someone is adding a little extra on for themselves .
and there was a definite difference in how much liquor each bartender put in .
in my opinion , both were pretty weak pours .
they have drink specials sunday - thursday , but none for the weekends .
i really like this joint .
the place has a good dive feel , dark but not terribly seedy .
the other bars in town smell better and have a good enough selection .
inexcusable .
anyway , they asked me questions about my day , then performed it back .
even if the improv had n't rocked , there 's still karaoke after !
surly bartenders and foamy guinness .
what 's not to like ?
love this place !
murph rules !
all in all , it 's a solid place for sure .
great staff and selection .
the atmosphere is casual and vey relaxed .
great hang .
it 's a nice , comfortable , homey kind of bar .
monday nights they have karaoke , which can also be a great time .
they have an epically awesome beer garden in the summer .
sometimes , they have live music upstairs which is hit or miss .
they have a lot to offer !
check this place out .
prices are good and there 's an excellent scotch/whisky selection as well .
your mileage may vary depending on how much you like local music .
it 's strange and offputting and also makes the place reek of desperation .
the specials are quite cheap between sunday and wednesday .
my only gripe is that the beer garden could use better lighting .
mike n molly 's has an excellent beer selection , an excellent whiskey selection .
it is perfect for coming in really any ( or every ? )
their beer garden is excellent .
sometimes a dance party happens .
i will always stop in here if i am in town .
i came of age here in many ways .
dancing will probably break out .
free admission on mondays , because it 's karaoke night .
i even had a bartender recognize me and say hi outside of the bar .
( no , that does not mean i drink too much . )
lovely .
decent !
very laid back and chilled for the most part .
a small bar area inside with a large patio outside .
they usually have some live music a few times during the week .
very enjoyable .
the beer and service is good .
quality is not bad .
though a small grip .
there are a handful of taps .
things rotate , but i have found port , founders , goose island etc .
tons of bottles from all over .
us micros and imports from around the world .
overall a nice place to relax and have some good beers with friends .
i got there late and there was no seating .
i liked that there was no cover charge .
this is one of those places that i wish i went to more often .
last time i ordered a glass of w.l .
this is a great spot for spring and summer .
this is my go to place , i love it here .
mondays and tuesdays are my favorite , comedy and kareoke night whoo whoo !
huge beer garden , they hold lots of shows out there in the summer .
they also have really awesome djs .
devon is a really fun bartender , lots of spunk .
pretty big selection of booze , no food .
the drinks are cheap anyway !
the same beers just up the road in chicago are 8-9 bucks !
keep up the good work mike n molly 's !
this place is ideal in the summer when there are outdoor shows .
they also have a decent selection of beer and liquor .
they do n't serve food which can be annoying for an early evening show .
i ca n't say too much as i 'm not a regular .
they also have some fresh , ready-to-eat items like salads , samosas and baklava .
they 're pretty similar to the other international food store .
i usually just visit whichever one is least out of my way .
this is the smaller of the two , with overall a slightly smaller selection .
if you are looking for more commonplace ingredients , i would look elsewhere .
also , there are weekly sales ( saturdays i believe ) on their cheeses .
i really miss euro mart .
i really like millenium nails .
they do the whole massage , filing , cuticle trimming , etc .
their polish selection is basically limited to opi .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
never again !
this place is totally overpriced , and they 're sloppy .
also , the massage chairs suck .
i finally had them just turn it off .
let 's just say i 'll be searching out a new nail place .
okay , so i went back to give this place a second chance .
total mistake .
needless to say , i definitely wo n't be coming here again .
i have been to millennium nails several times .
he was friendly , fast and my nails still look great after two weeks .
one of my favorite nail salons in town , and newly remodeled .
very friendly staff .
love it here !
never go here !
they are rude and do a horrible job .
i had a fill done here the other day .
it is jagged and a different color and it looks terrible .
my right hand nails are longer than the left .
the tech asked me if i wanted square or round .
i said , i like it just the way they are ( rounded ) .
it 's aggravating but it 's a first world problem , right ?
my first experience here was excellent .
it was in the fall of _num_ when i learned i was pregnant .
the third time i went there i had a male tech .
i chose a vanilla colored nail polish and he said the same thing .
i told him i like light colors .
i thought it was sarcasm so i smiled back and just nodded my head .
i 'm do n't giving this place a chance .
while u was watching her , i counted way too many health code violations !
for the next client !
gross !
then he used tweezers that that had not been cleaned .
they do not sterilize the tools between customer uses .
he cut my cuticles so low they started bleeding .
if you go to this place you 're going to get an infectious disease .
i 've been going here for _num_ years !
they are great .
i love them and highly recommend them .
if i could give this less stars i would .
this place is completely shady and horrible .
my friends and i went here for a pedicure .
she was very sweet and talkative .
my friend 's experience is what really baffled me though .
what ? !
i was absolutely astonished .
problems..
all in all , a worthless place to go and get your mood spoilt !
would never recommend to anyone else .
zero stars !
yuck !
worst pedicure of my life .
save your money .
terrible service .
terrible pedicures .
go somewhere else .
elegant nails on south neil has the same prices with superior services .
just a little north of campus .
the sandwiches and burgers are very heavy and caloric .
beer and wine selection are not huge .
very nice and relaxed off campus bar .
the food is pretty good too !
low-key place that 's good for drinks or a meal .
bartender and servers are late-20s age and very charming .
none of that rushed , overzealous high school service .
lunch special .
that goes for all dishes , actually .
huge portions .
tons of food for the money .
this place has killer nachos , and usually pretty good servers .
lots of eye candy abounds .
my usual place to watch sports .
former coke bottling plant building in town , tastefully redone .
i have more tattoos now , but my first is still my favorite .
the color has held up nicely over almost _num_ years .
also , better priced at app .
$ _num_ for a lobe and $ _num_ for a cartilage .
basically efficient , well-priced , and quick piercings for students .
i have several tattoos from nick and they all turned out great .
amazing freehand work .
very cool staff .
very happy with my tat still ... _num_ years later
good price ! ! !
nice design .
north of campus , in downtown champaign , near good dining .
they host good music concerts , and david sedaris has appeared .
older theatre but it still does the job !
oh wait ... that does seem kinda like a bromance/man-date .
oh wells .
i 'll definitely come again for a cheap flick .
or maybe another bromance .
an absolute treasure in downtown champaign .
a 150-foot screen that shows classic films monthly in their original frame size .
they have great concessions , cheap tickets , and an original wurlitzer organ .
really fun theater to go to .
a nice piece of history .
lovely old theater -- so glad it 's been restored and maintained !
the staff is always courteous and helpful .
a variety of shows is sure to please all types of community members !
a nust see !
i am not always a big fan of arirang .
somehow i find that their food is kinda bland .
but surprisingly there 's lots of koreans eating at this place .
oh well , i am not korean .
what do i know ?
= )
i 'm a huge fan of the combination bulgogi plate .
chicken , pork , beef ... all on one plate .
i 'm getting hungry for some right now .
too bad i 'm two hours away ... *sigh*
the food 's decent , but i 've never been impressed by this place .
mmm
authentic and affordable , plus no msg !
hmm..i see this is a trend with the korean restaurants in campus town .
so first things first , they do n't accept cash .
my , we need to get with the times people .
um , okay..
so i order one of the specials , which is tofu soup and fish .
so yeah , the food is okay , not too bad .
i do n't know.. maybe there are n't too many korean restaurants around here ?
i 'm getting deja-vu from woori jib but the food was better here .
pretty fast .
a-ok - three stars - seems about right .
`` a-ri-rang '' is the most popular and best-known korean folk song .
a-ri-rang is an ancient native korean word with no modern meaning .
'ari ' means `` beautiful '' ; 'rang ' can mean `` dear '' .
he always has the tv blaring on headline news .
but the food is good , maybe the best korean on campus .
this is no small feat in a university town hosting _num_ native koreans .
when i 'm on campus , this is where i like to eat .
if you want korean soup or fried rice , go here .
best on campus .
this is a low key campus joint so what do you expect ? ?
straight up best budaejigae on the planet .
good korean restaurant and close to engineering labs .
the owner was irritated as promised in other yelp reviews .
the dining area was cramped and uninviting .
i will definitely find another korean place to go to in the future .
food is pretty good , though rather pricey for a campustown restaurant in my opinion
very good soup and fish dishes .
each place has their own specialties .
i love getting the bibimbap and bulgogi from here .
in my opinion , the soon du bu does n't have much flavor .
like the tofu soup and kimchi fried rice here !
l
i give it _num_ stars because of what i get for the price .
every dish comes with at least _num_ side dishes of kimchi..
try the bulgogi dishes and the budae jigae .
by far best budae jigae .
also try the omu rice .
it 's their version of omelet fried rice .
fried rice is wrapped in omelet egg .
in fact , what do you expect at a no-waiter restaurant ?
you do n't have to pay tips already .
cheap and hits the spot .
i think it 's one of the most affordable korean restaurants on campus .
for a college kid , it 's a huge win .
i think the omu rice here is pretty clutch too .
it depends what dish you ordered .
i personally recommend soup # _num_ budae-jigae .
and the fried fish is also good .
this is my korean staple on campus .
i always get the budae jjigae .
be warned , it is huge .
they make great kimchi as well , especially the potato variety .
cafeteria style seating , but so worth the delicious food .
give it a try and fall in love with the spicy soups .
the boss trying to sell me something they want to sell , which sucks .
and the food is very low quality in all the korean restaurant .
i have had .
donot come here in uiuc ! !
!
looking for korean food ?
want budaejigae ?
if so , order here !
the market itself is a war zone .
every day , there is always a lunch special going on .
and it is most definitely worth every penny !
in english ?
tofu stew .
trust me on this .
i adore the budaejigae here !
if you must order something , get that .
you can also choose the level of spiciness of the broth .
restaurant review
my first venture into korean food in champaign was good .
it was easy to order because we were the first customers of the day .
they have a nice laminated menu at the desk to chose your entree .
i selected the combo platter of bulgogi which was _num_ .
prices have gone up according to my wife since she was in college .
pro : average price korean food , large portion
cons : long cook time , higher price than average lunch places
hidden gem :
your meal comes with rice , soup , and _num_ korean ban chae
self service for cost effective .
a lot of steam rice .
good ! !
, .
.
.
+ .
food is decent .
serving time is mediocre at best .
bibimbap sauce literally redeemed my meal .
price is somewhat higher than expected .
daily special number _num_ is the way to go !
it comes with half a mackerel , and a decent bowl of tofu soup .
the mackerel can be dry at times though .
the kimchi jjigae has a large portion and tastes good too .
like the bugaejigae and soup there .
the food here is reasonably priced with a large portion .
waiting time is a little big long -- it often takes more than _num_ minutes
i tried out their bibimbap and it was fairly average .
not much else to say here .
the food is fairly average , it 's not that great .
but overall , would not recommend to eat with families or close friends .
maybe for a quick lunch or dinner .
the owner is very nice and the place is fairly clean .
chances are , the fine folks at natural gourmet can help you out .
located just west of biaggi 's , natural gourmet is easy to find .
she 's amazing !
they also have an amazing selection of food items , particularly baking supplies .
) .
no place is perfect , and ng does have a few cons .
produce selection is very limited , to the point of being almost nonexistent .
this probably wo n't bother most people .
this is my go-to place for organic and pastured meats .
i like the noodle soups especially .
the mussleman curry chicken with egg is a must try .
fantastic !
the flavor is outstanding .
i 'm hooked !
if you can handle the spice do try the basil beef too !
help , i 'm addicted .
you wo n't miss big chain natural food stores once you visit this place !
go out and support this wonderful locally owned business .
had to share an actual picture of the deliciousness this time .
mussamen chicken curry with egg .
love this menu item !
love this place !
and , the deli , ca n't go wrong !
they know their supplements and food in and out .
they carry the best brands in the industry .
hmmm what to say about this chevy 's .
our waiter brought us out chips and salsa with two cups of salsa .
then we ordered guacamole , which he did n't bring us .
so , not good for the tipping there .
if you want to sit in the bar you can go right ahead .
i ordered a steak quesadilla and it was huge and awesome .
i 've been craving another one ever since we went !
my husband got something called the chevy spread ?
looking forward to going back .
all the way through , chevys is a delicious meal .
the entrees are great .
anything 's good , but in particular , i want to recommend the flautas .
also , make sure you get the yellow corn stuff .
but , it 's delicious .
i was craving mexican food .
plain old delicious , refried-beany , flavorful , familiar mexican food .
i ordered the flautas , my usual .
what the fuck ?
i ordered flautas , not a bloody fruit salad .
i wanted sour cream !
guac !
pico de gallo and shredded lettuce !
craving it .
you need it .
i do n't care that this is a chain .
i would love to buy a tub of that salsa .
all of the menu items i 've tried there have been amazing .
it 's always friendly service , and they 're very accommodating .
the prices are good as well .
never has a restaurant left more of an impression on me .
i have never felt worse after a meal or left more dissatisfied .
you could not pay me $ _num_ to eat the food i ordered again .
we were starving .
neither of us had eaten all day .
the first thing we did was order the nachos .
i am talking the pasty orange processed shit , pun fucking intended .
n-i-n-e fucking dollars .
that 's _num_ cents an ounce .
there was *maybe* _num_ ounces of cheese on my chips .
the entire plate of nachos probably cost them $ _num_ .
we did not finish them .
lucky us , or so we thought .
apparently `` smothered '' burritos actually means fucking coated with nacho cheese .
fuck .
you can tell i really hate this shit .
let 's move on .
the beef in my tacos was ground fine .
real fine .
not joking .
the beans were the texture of a watery soup .
the chicken taco was edible .
i think .
i ate it at least .
i was starving though .
again , we had n't eaten all day .
i did n't touch the nacho cheese coated burritos .
i tried the chimichanga last .
i had two bites .
the rice was the best thing on the plate .
the service was as good as it possibly could have been .
you could tell the servers did not like working there .
our server did n't bring us the check .
he had the busser/dishwasher bring us the check .
i do n't blame him .
honestly , we felt sorry for him .
i come for the corn cake .
i ca n't even tell you what entree i order .
it 's good , but , like , ok good .
one time i had a waiter bring more corn cake then entree .
i told him i loved him and left a hefty tip .
ooh , i just remembered something i get .
corn cake ( kidding ) .
that sauce is awesome .
great guacamole and salsa .
the tacos were great .
so much better than la fiesta .
fast and friendly service .
they also have a tortilla maker as well .
pretty neat .
with limited options in campaign this weekend , i suggested chevy 's .
well , where to begin ... ..
also , the service was mediocre .
she was n't even bad , she just lacked a personality .
bummer chevy 's ...
i wanted to like you .
yuck , this place has really gone down hill .
ew .
the chips had no salt and the salsa tasted like ketchup .
it looked like baby food and did not hold together at all .
our server was attentive , i ca n't fault him .
but the food was beyond repulsive .
they followed me here ? )
we saw that on fridays they have a $ _num_ frozen strawberry margarita special .
that deal was calling our name , so we each got one .
the chips and salsa , however , were totally blargh !
they were n't even worth eating .
also , the bartender was visibly perturbed when we asked for the check .
closed .
business is closed as of the end of november _num_ .
this place is closed , and for good reason .
you kind of have to treat legends this way , like a fresh puppy .
it 's a science and they have the titration juuuuust right .
the fries are awesome too .
good university crowd to go along with all the university memorabelia on the walls .
surprisingly , this is more than the college bar .
the food is served fresh and fast , and the prices are moderate .
i would n't be surprised if it were worth trying .
a u of i staple .
drinks/food are pretty cheap .
thinking about legends brings back so many college memories ... tear .
it 's always wheel chair accessible which is great .
there 's few places on campus that are .
yay legends .
ugh .
this place existed before campus got swanked up over the last number of years .
it is a big yawning space , with marginal food and service .
guess i am old school on this one .
go illini !
good food , good drinks .
i hope they still have magic hat on tap .
yet another sports bar that 's on campus .
do n't get the mushroom soup here even though it sounds awesome !
honestly , this is the same as most any other bar .
good place to get a table and hang out .
an extra star because they sell playing cards for a buck .
solid sports bar i think .
the employees have always been very nice .
crispy , not too heavily battered , not too greasy .
the portion is huge also !
i am a legends fan .
thursday thru saturday they have a dj so you can make requests and such .
i just wish their kitchen was open later .
legends has food ? ?
seriously ? ?
how come i did not know this ?
they make a fabulous sex on the beach .
the drink prices are reasonable .
the noise level is tolerable .
the large area does make it enjoyable for happy hours though .
food 's pretty good .
either way .
the drink prices are reasonable for campus and amazing when compared to chicago .
their half off appetizer deal on fridays is pretty sweet too .
but my all time favorite is the legends ranch chicken served only on mondays .
i 'd call in sick for that .
love it love it .
i had a delicious chicken wrap with french fries .
i liked the all-wood interior , gave the place a nice feel to it .
i 've had many a fun night here .
fun times .
wait staff and bartenders were always nice .
food - taco salad , how i love thee .
i have n't found a taco salad in the city that compares .
it 's huge and actually has a lot of lettuce !
cheap too , even for a college student .
i want to like legends more .
however , the hamburgers are a bit weak .
also i do n't think the burgers come with fries .
we were a bit disappointed to see bags of chips .
maybe next time i 'll order something else !
i am nothing if not magnanimous .
!
never any cover , legends is always crowded on weekend nights .
a great place for happy hours , and just the occasional night out .
if only they would stop repainting the exterior wackier and wackier every _num_ years ...
legendarily lame .
it 's like getting your scrotum caught while zipping up your fly .
it 's like watching schindler 's list during a bachelor party .
it 's like clogging the toilet at your girlfriend 's parent 's house .
not fun at all .
absolute love this place !
we also really enjoyed the outdoor seating area out back .
be careful what you ask for at this popular campus town location .
but straying from those favorites might make you wish you had n't .
do n't go to legends to drink .
we try and go there for the best fish sandwich in town !
be sure and order the beer batter onion rings also .
a quaint illini sports bar with a nice atmosphere and easy access .
a pay parking lot is right next door .
i 'm seriously confused .
do some of the idiots reviewing legends know which bar is actually legends ? ?
im a regular there and have been for the past year and a half .
they 've never had _num_ dollar long islands esp not on thursdays .
oh and their fish sandwich is great .
i used to like this bar when i was in college , on occasion .
i definitely had some good times there , and the outdoor area was nice .
i-l-l-i-n-i .
what ?
you did n't realize this is an illini bar ?
how could you not tell from the blue and traffic cone orange facade ?
i did n't have food or alcohol so i can not comment on those .
i am a big fan of the stepnpull in the women 's bathroom .
the bar portion also pretty bad .
it 's always hard to get the attention of the bartenders .
come here thursday 's for `` logo night . ''
beer is n't great and it 's relatively expensive for what it is .
they also have a terrible patio in the back .
on top of that the food is n't really very good .
so it fails at being a bar and sports bar .
i was not disappointed .
it 's a bar - bar food , beer , booths and stools .
the food is actually quite good .
big mistake !
bigger mistake .
they came back from the bar after another 20+ minutes without drinks .
totally meh .
yuck .
not to mention the utter lack of life on a friday night .
do so .
guinness on tap ?
automatic _num_ stars from me .
another star for that .
another bonus was that the bartender serving me was very cute .
i cant stand this bar .
it takes forever to get a drink .
they only pour beer !
i want to punch that guy so bad .
i am so glad me and my friends do n't go here often .
i strongly suggest pickingmurphys over this abomination of terrible service .
and the student newspaper voted them for best service !
never go here .
college bar with okay prices for a beer !
the patio is a decent size and appealing when it 's nice out .
the prices are about campus average and the tap selection sucks .
definitely my go-to if i feel like drinking on campus without being heavily annoyed .
i did n't think it was sleazy .
great drink specials , friendly staff .
strawberry is the best 'flavorita ' .
i can not comprehend how their burgers were ever voted best in champaign .
i 've never seen so many polo shirts and khakis in one venue .
the big pro is the location in campus town .
the big con is the food .
the cheeseburger at legends is a typical bar-style burger .
featuring a sesame bun , a thin patty , and topped with the works .
the bun , beef , and topping could all bring more to the table .
on the other hand , it 's still a college bar .
but it 's my favorite and thus _num_ stars .
and , i have to say , the beer selection 's pretty good actually .
the food 's surprisingly good as well .
but you really go to legends for the atmosphere .
their food is actually pretty decent .
not overly amazing but pretty good as far as bar food goes .
go early .
this is def a day drinking bar .
i 'm torn about legends .
beer selection is okay , though .
would definitely go again .
looks like a fun bar at night too
you really had to twist your head around or rearrange the 50lb barstools .
the nachos supreme w/chicken were anything but ...
with heavy heart , i have to give legends three stars .
it is my favorite bar on campus .
however , the service has been horrible lately .
they misspelled my name on the ride the rail name list on their wall .
the place was packed , but they are definitely understaffed .
there were only _num_ bartenders working and the line was very long .
moreover , the bartender got me the wrong beer !
my personal choice of burger is the works burger .
it 's not great , but still better than burgers from joes or murphys .
my favorite campus bar , how many grilled chicken sandwiches have i enjoyed here ?
well i ca n't remember but i 'm sure there were plenty .
along with $ _num_ long islands in various flavors .
could lunch get any more divine ? !
their loaded fries are bomb and the fish sandwiches are definitely worth the waits .
had a fish sandwich on friday and it was quite good .
casual atmosphere and we went early to avoid the late night bar crowd .
it really seems like they have everything here .
they do have hooked deals from time to time which is a nice touch .
he made a substitute drink but it was just awful .
their burgers are also really enjoyable .
also , in my opinion , best burger of the campustown bars .
this will be the bar i always go back to .
descriptive phrase : classic , cool college pub .
no hassles from the locals , though , which was nice .
in fact , everyone there seemed to be having a chill but fun time .
nice .
the burgers and fries here are actually very good .
i really like the bleu moon burger .
and the loaded fries are always a good idea .
i ordered the fish sandwich with onion rings and it was so good .
and money wise , it was definitely worth it .
the nachos are worth it too !
the condiments are distributed evenly and there was enough cheese for all the chips .
the salsa also had a nice kick too , very delicious .
the service was great too .
way to go legends
looking for a spot to eat on my weekend adventure in champaign .
it 's a very spacious bar with tables along the walls .
the food was pretty decent .
i had a ham and swiss sandwich with guinness mustard on a pretzel bun .
i wish i would have ordered two of them it was so good .
why five stars you ask ?
and why review a hooters in champaign when i live in chicago ?
so _num_ star .
hooters also leaves the `` tips '' on its wings too .
pretty much what you 'd expect .
the most disgusting food i have ever been 'served ' in my life .
the fries were cold and the service was less than desirable .
i do n't recommend anyone go to the champaign hooters .
instead , go to buffalo wild wings - waaaaay better !
only drawback is the price , they are pretty expensive .
wow !
food really , really bad .
i gave it _num_ [ $ ] just because it so overpriced .
plus they are easy on the eyes .
i love hooters !
this however was the worst food i have ever had at any location .
the chicken was so dry and cheese sauce was hard and tasted disgusting .
the philly cheesesteak and burger we had for lunch were very good .
the service was great , waitress was very attentive .
there was only one negative while we were there .
there was a university of illinois football game on .
everything tastes fine , just missing some texture .
even jus finding this place ( located behind hardee 's ) is difficult .
it 's as if hooters took over a previous establishment not big in business .
the bar only seats _num_ with a large square room .
there r only _num_ hooters signs on the building itself .
ur welcome !
; ) only 3* for mediocre-ism
food is just like other sports bars .
not a fan of the wings
i 'm a woman so i ca n't go higher than a _num_ ... .
set up is a little awkward .
i nearly walked past the hostess booth
i just wanted a beer and the service was horrible .
i got one beer and could n't get the bartender to come back .
btw-for a college town , the girls were n't good looking at all .
maybe because it was monday night and the c team was working .
wings and buffalo shrimp were great .
fried pickles were cooked just right .
service was above average but it was a very slow night .
as always , hooters did n't disappoint .
will be back next time in town !
this place was bad
i came in hooters because of course i love it
this is a tester store
so they try new menus
but here is the weird part i 'm
_num_ % puerto rican a well respected one
because there was plenty of seats
waitresses were great !
better wings than i 've had at other hooters .
waitress came around offering a free margarita to critique the bartender .
best hooters ever !
one of the better hooters i have been to in the midwest !
hooters wings are the same wherever you go .
worst hooters ever !
walked out after sitting for _num_ minutes - no service .
waitress standing around .
empty tables all around .
the food was great , as usual .
zero on hooters philosophy on customer service .
not worth it .
they are not realising that how bad they are .
this happened at 8:30pm .
we were really shocked by looking at the whole experience .
we will not return to this place and never recommend to our friends .
grr .
service ok. food ok. ambiance ok .
nothing particularly special , but nothing necessarily wrong .
i 'll probably wait another _num_ years before returning ...
my husband and i frequent hooters for lunch dates as often as we can .
i love the wings and he loves the grilled cheese !
we always have a blast when we visit ! !
all of the waitresses we have had have been wonderful .
our waitress last time was especially wonderful ! !
she smiled and engaged us all the way through our meal .
we really appreciated her .
five stars all of the way for hooters champaign .
thank you !
!
this was a great massage !
you can tell he is very knowledgeable and experienced .
i would definitely recommend it , especially because the prices are awesome .
my husband got me a gift certificate for a one-hour massage with glenn .
his prices are also very reasonable .
also , he is located in suite _num_ , not _num_ .
that was , hands down , the best hour massage i have ever gotten .
both of us were so relaxed and just felt great after .
we will be returning..today lol .
our appointment is at 3:30 and i ca n't wait .
i loved this no-frills , just-massage approach .
very professional , the perfect amount of pressure , and great student offers .
i will definitely be back and recommend to all !
quality : glenn is fantastic in what he does .
price : the deals offered are great , especially if you are a student .
i feel like i am receiving my money 's worth every time .
he puts on some very soothing spa music that really accentuates the mood .
glenn is super professional and do everything to accommodate his clients .
the massage is great .
it was my first time there , but not in the building itself .
very relaxing ! ! ! !
glenn has the magic touch to make all the pains disappear ! ! !
!
glenn has a lot of training and experience .
glenn made me feel comfortable and then gave me an excellent first massage experience .
i came away feeling great , relaxed and renewed .
i 'll be back and would gladly recommend him to friends .
he offers a variety of different kinds of massages and therapy .
the meal ended with fortune cookies and a plate of succulent oranges .
the service was great and the prices were n't bad either .
i definitely recommend this restaurant .
great service and good food .
i found myself @ peking garden celebrating a friends ' completion of his prelims .
i was horrified and delighted simultaneously .
hells yes .
that was my fault for ordering it , not theirs for making it .
i sampled everyone else 's dishes however , and they were quite tasty .
except the second time -- my fortune was blank .
what a let down !
i had my hopes high ...
i took a few bites and threw the rest in the trash ( ...
i ca n't believe i 'm confessing to this ! ... ) .
maybe i 'll give it another try .
so many lovely memories of going here twice a week ( at least ! )
with my boy .
excellent owners and staff with a very inviting and unique environment .
she remembers all of their names , and greets and hugs their kids too .
this place is great .
that , and the appetizers were very yummy .
not only that , but they are very accommodating .
this place is great .
goooo heeeeereee om nom nom ...
the first difficulty i had with peking garden is ordering .
they do not have a website and it is not easily found online .
luckily i was able to find one on campusfood.com .
i ordered chicken and broccoli and the portions were huge .
i definitely will be back to hopefully give this place it 's fifth star !
i realize that the standards for chinese food in this town are extreeeemely low .
fried rice- fairly standard , right ?
i 've never had such a horrible and disgusting excuse for fried rice .
there was nothing in it .
nothing .
a scoop full of sticky brown-ish rice .
it smelled like cardboard and had no discernible flavor .
just rice doused with soy sauce .
effing gross .
the chicken did not taste like general tso .
it was not spicy .
it was not flavorful .
and the meat itself ?
dry , tough , stringy , chewy .
this place blows .
i love spicy food .
if you are into spicy food , you 'll love it !
average fast food chinese served by friendly people .
nothing wrong with three stars .
awesome food and friendly wait staff .
we do n't even go there that often !
yummy yummy .
nice sit-down chinese place .
what else is there to say ?
peking garden was a weird case for me though .
at the time , i would have almost gave it a _num_ star rating .
i was glad i did n't though .
my entree was great but the soup and egg roll tasted weird..
the service was also bad this trip .
the worst part was that me and my girlfriend got food sickness from it ...
it was not fun especially since we both had to work later that day .
we are pretty sure it was from the egg drop soup .
alright food .
pretty average in taste , quality , and prices .
a bit inconsistent with their cooking .
love this place !
good portions , nice flavor , interesting menu options .
i 've never dined in , only carryout .
just walk on over and i have a bag full of delicious warm food .
you will also be given plates of raw vegetables , meat , and noodles .
definitely a treat during winter months , and worth a try for adventurous diners !
i was n't familiar with basil chicken .
so i asked the young lady at the counter what was in it .
she informed me that it was carrots , onions , chicken and sauce .
( i asked because i do not like green peppers or mushrooms . )
it did n't even contain carrots or onions .
since it was their mistake i figured they would make it right .
i called to complain .
she replied , `` i do n't care ! ''
and hung up on me .
i wont be going back !
i come here for lunch occasionally , and the food is pretty decent .
what a great memory and way to connect with your customers !
now , for the food .
i literally would eat it everyday if i had a heart of steel .
the general tso 's is pretty good , although not outstanding .
it 's pretty much a party in your mouth .
and the delivery service is great .
woohoo !
forgot to write a review last week .
a friend treated me to dinner here .
it was clean and quiet and the service was prompt and courteous .
the egg rolls were good .
my entree was delicious and plentiful .
again , the house tea was good .
very tasty food from vegetarian perspective .
loved their home style tofu and egg plant .
atmosphere was nice .
the owner was very friendly .
i 'm definitely coming back .
i have had delivery from peking garden a few times .
it is life sustaining , but not much beyond that .
the portions are huge ... be advised !
it reminds me of the many neighborhood chinese places all up and down manhattan .
also good won ton soup .
this place offers solid authentic chinese food .
i wish i could rate _num_ stars .
rude !
i have been a regular of this place since _num_ .
but man , these people can cook !
the shrimp fried rice is delish !
reminds me of chinatown in chicago il happy times !
ok yes , it is a little shady .
but hot damn is it my guilty pleasure .
drinks are totally from _num_ 's .
love it .
this is our favorite chinese place in town .
we recommend this highly .
the good :
-their egg rolls are very good too .
-the little donuts were super yummy , though standard .
the meh :
-the sweet and sour chicken .
we 've been there couple of times .
i 'd definitely recommend my friends to go there !
great soups and love the steamed dumplings .
give it a try .
i 'm a regular there for lunch .
they 're friendly and serve good food .
the lunch menu is also very affordable .
it 's just a lot of extra food i do n't need .
i 've never been disappointed .
delicious chinese food in a town where there is a lot of competition .
the orange beef and chili chicken are both excellent dishes .
definitely need to be cleaned though , the restaurant is dirty .
i tried the mandarin beef , mongolian beef and potstickers .
the cashier was also friendly and remembered what i ordered right away .
there were a couple other orders ready when i went .
two small complaints i have are the soy sauce and fortune cookies .
delicious in general .
servings are small compared to other chinese restaurants .
ordered for delivery _num_ min before close
food came quick
food good
listened to special requests
recommended
so , the next best option was to get delivery .
pros :
-fast delivery
-secure delivery .
-super nice service
-good food
-good portions
-good variety
-good for groups
-interior of the store is cozy , clean , and well done
cons :
-food can be oily , but to be honest those particular dishes are oily anywhere
-the americanized dishes are n't that good in my opinion
not that big of an issue .
i really like this place .
i work downtown so this is my goto asian lunch spot .
also , the owners and staff are very friendly .
the child screamed .
the man yelled back and then hit him again .
no one should go to this restaurant .
got take out on a monday night .
i used the online ordering which was convenient and easy .
we got a chicken lo mein combo and an empress chicken .
the chicken lo mein was good .
portion size including the rice was huge .
definitely enough for two big meals .
the egg rolls that game with it were average .
my empress chicken was alright .
it tasted like every other sweet and sour sauce .
the chicken also seemed to be a little soft and mushy .
our meal cost $ _num_ .
i unfortunately was just not very impressed with my empress chicken .
3/5
i 've grown tired of these cookie cutter chinese takeout places .
peking garden is a throwback to how i remember real chinese food .
big table with a huge lazy susan in the middle .
the dumplings were huge and homemade .
dinner for _num_ with drinks and appetizers came to almost exactly $ _num_ .
i thought it was a great value .
it was n't the newest .
it was n't the flashiest .
but it was one of the best chinese meals i 've had in years .
love the food here !
i love trying new things and i live nearby .
so far every choice has been a great success !
try their eggplant ( yes , eggplant ) dish .
you will be surprised by how flavorful a vegetable dish can be .
our go-to , favorite place to have chinese food ! !
the spicy chicken [ # _num_ ] is a must-try ! !
the owners are vert nice too .
fantastic restaurant and owners .
potstickers-get them .
open let-made of awesome .
hotdogs and headline news on tv ?
i 'm there !
their gyros , chicken tenders ... brats ... . daily specials are good too .
things i 've tried :
all of the daily specials - all tasty and what you 'd expect .
gyros - pretty good .
the pitas are grilled instead of just warmed .
chicken tenders - what you 'd expect .
to top it off , the owner is a nice guy .
now that 's good service : )
delicious hot dogs .
the only place i 'd like to have hot dogs is in here !
and yeah , you can get a glimpse of cnn headlines while there .
but you have to clean after yourself .
surprisingly good .
i 'll have to come back to try the rest of the menu .
it has everything from frozen cheesecake on a stick to tamales to gyros .
i never would have guessed since this place looks pretty average .
this place is great- the owner is the nicest guy as well .
cheap too .
great lunch stop .
i came here 1-2 times a week for a semester .
probably not the healthiest option , but it was one of the most delicious !
my favorites are the vienna footlong and italian .
the polish is really mediocre though .
the fries are the best part .
the owner may seem mean , but he is one cool guy .
he only accepts visa or mastercard .
and even then , there is a _num_ cent charge .
p.s .
ask for extra sport peppers !
it sounds like people are upset because of no sesame seed buns .
well , good news .
yum .
they 've also switched peppers .
be aware if you do n't want any kick !
fries are freaking awesome as always , hot and crisp .
he runs a great place with pride that many eateries lack .
it 's the perfect lunch place .
especially if you are tired of the overpriced crap in the union 's basement .
btw , the owner has always been nice to me ...
a reasonable place for decent food at a cheap price .
something about the ambiance of the place puts me off though .
probably the most reasonable lunch deal in the green street area .
i 'm always amused by the cast of characters who work at wonderdogs .
i effing love wonderdogs .
on top of that , the food is fast , cheap , and delicious .
where else should one go but wonderdogs ?
thanks wonderdogs , for putting up with ridiculous , hungry graduate students .
: )
is that ok ? ''
he smiled and started making my dog .
so kudos to him for being accomodating .
both he and the woman working there at the time were very polite .
the dog itself was pretty good .
and they ask you to have a seat and walk it out to you .
awesome .
easily the best gyro in town .
the pita is crispy and oily .
sauce very flavorful .
veggies very fresh tasting .
all good .
i had a very average experience here .
the one-stop shop .
something old , something new .
i like the collection of frocks and outerwear .
also the accessories are fun .
and the vintage frames are great !
a surprising amount of my wardrobe favorites are from dandelion .
its just a fun shop !
( that i miss dearly ! )
the best thrift store i 've been to outside a major city .
i rarely leave without finding something i love ( and have to have ! )
eighties blouses are true polyester eighties blouses .
there are obscure labels and strange finds .
there are boots to match in the corner , you know .
no wonder they 've been around so long .
i loved dandelion when i lived in champaign .
standouts : red corduroy flares that fit like a glove .
the prices for sell/trade are fair .
i went with selling the clothes in favor of the concert .
however , i find hipster douchebags amusing , not annoying .
drop by dandelion .
highlights of sunday 's trip to dandelion :
- a sequined blazer befitting a _num_ 's gameshow host
- a rabbit fur coat straight out of siberia
- horribly awesome _num_ 's prom dresses
- pants in every conceivable color of pleather
- a sweater vest festooned with images of playful cats
most pieces seemed far too extreme for the average person to pull off .
great cheap sunglasses .
i have about _num_ pair from there .
just not for me .
but again , great sunglasses .
luckily , dandelion also has dressing rooms , unlike some used clothing shops .
`` used . ''
i do n't know i just was n't that impressed .
maybe it 's hit or miss ?
i just did n't find it that great .
i love stopping by here once every one or two weeks .
they always seem to get in new finds .
( i am a goodwill pro , too ) .
there is a good mix of truly vintage and newer items as well .
great shoe selection .
i would like to see them get more variety of jewelry , however .
really rad ! !
!
i came here with a friend this summer .
we had a blast !
this place is filled with awesome fun old things !
and it 's even clean !
i was certain i would never have shoes like these again .
when i found them here , and in my size !
it was the greatest day !
it smells nice , they have the incense i like .
their hours are more reasonable than carrie 's .
my fiance got some amazing pants there .
what i do n't like :
their organization .
organizing by color ... why ?
why ?
some of their clothes are literally falling apart and still marked at full price .
i did n't find anything , but even in la that 's not unusual .
mens items were very clear .
the woman working the register was friendly and helpful .
i 'm a thrift-store dweller .
i was in chambana and i needed new shoes .
i saw this place and i figured -- why not ?
worth noting : they have better hours than most vintage shops or thrift stores .
they 're just doing their thing , guys .
ca n't go wrong there .
tumble inn , stumble out .
a true bar bar .
the outdoor area is a plus too .
never had a bad time at the tumble inn .
many amazing nights at the tumble inn .
the only place i could and can get a ice cold woodchuck .
this bar is nothing short of amazing .
everyone i 've ever introduced to this bar has loved it !
it 's close enough to campus apartments to walk there and stumble home .
definite must in champaign-urbana !
good people , awesome place .
everyone here is super friendly , and it 's a nice in-between campus/downtown spot .
i spent many , many nights here and always had fun .
the bartenders ( chester especially ) are great and the company is good .
you just ca n't go wrong .
a timeless gathering place is their mantra , and oh so true .
ti is an unbelievable dive bar .
i love to hang out there especially at the end of the night .
nothing else like it , an original !
good times as my cuz used to say : )
but guess what ?
my sister , wife and illini niece loved it !
loved the genuine neighborhood feel and the old busch stadium seats at the tables .
next year i 'm setting the golden tee record !
great fun place ! ! !
the service was wonderful and the older decor brought a smile !
always a good time , and a great dive bar .
for townies and long time family regulars .
a full bar , and a small bottle beer list .
though that is just my picky tastes .
that is best as i can put it .
do n't forget that everyone stumbles out for good reason ...
my favorite bar , hands down , in the c-u area .
no frills or thrills , just a great place to hang out .
the best bar in town .
the best drinks .
the best bartenders .
we have so much fun when we visit .
it 's a great place to hang with friends and watch a game .
i 'd give it _num_ stars if i could .
in addition , laser does not have any effect on white hair at all .
the office is nice and very clean .
needless to say i was none too happy and gave up .
i used to love bob evans .
the sausage is still good , but everything else tasted like crap .
you mileage may vary .
bob evan 's in champaign il is very good .
we had pork roast with mashed potatoes and carrots .
plus dessert .
oh so good .
the help is very friendly and the place was clean so where the restrooms .
give that one a try .
anyhoo , they made us feel welcome after a long road trip .
the food was excellent , i had the breakfast .
the facility is immaculate , and the environment matches as well .
this bob evans is a hidden gem in this little town .
our waitress could not have been less thrilled to serve us .
the food was decent .
overall , a good travel spot for decent food .
woohoo !
seriously .
anyhoo , still delicious .
we had french toast and an omelet .
both satisfied the breakfast craving .
service was good and fast .
a solid breakfast choice if you are in the area .
sometimes , you just want breakfast .
i get that .
the pancakes are pretty good , but they 're huge .
i can barely finish half of them even when i 'm really hungry .
everything i 've tried has been pretty good , though nothing outstanding .
cleanest kitchen i have ever seen !
i mean , i was really hungover , so it did it 's job .
took about 15-20 minutes to get a table , but the service was good .
i had the potato encrusted pollack with green beans & baked potato .
my daughter had the pancakes with link sausage .
our last visit to bob evans was only ok .
love the fresh dinner rolls and the orange juice .
i always like the meatloaf , mashed potatoes and green beans .
this bob evans was like the others .
average chain service .
good when needing something familiar : - )
decided to try lunch to go today .
i ordered the ham & swiss grilled on sourdough and vegetable soup .
it 's just ok .
i liked the bread and the swiss cheese .
the vegetable soup was ok but it had a lot of corn in it .
the people working at the counter were very nice and the service was speedy .
how is this place empty ?
if you do n't want to wait in line this is the place .
i highly recommend giving it a shot .
however , the second time i went here , it was for breakfast .
service was ok , attentive and friendly .
this particular establishment has similar lay out as all others .
staff was mostly friendly and courteous .
food was not so good .
they ran out of pico-de-gallo for nachos at noon ! !
the eggs and biscuits were nice but not as good as other places .
boy oh boy did that joy end quickly ! ! !
!
ordered a full order of biscuits & gravy , the meal came fairly quickly .
it was hot as well .
my 1st indication of an issue were the hard ass biscuits he brought me .
i was completely grossed out ! !
!
then my apple juice had something floating in it..
gravy was good & workers were nice .
slightly cute , okay service , and okay food .
banana bread is great !
everything else ranges from okay to awful .
champaign public library does n't hold a candle to the urbana free library .
either way , the two libraries are on the lincoln trail system .
it 's truly wonderful .
and !
unless you 're looking for brand spankin ' new releases .
at the cpl , you can rent a dvd for $ _num_ .
keep it for an entire week .
measly late fees .
beautiful , huge & modern .
when i move , i 'm going to miss the free dvd rentals .
tip : be careful where you park .
most of the spaces are tiny and jam-packed with cars inches from one another .
this is the fanciest library i 've ever seen !
my favorite things about this library are :
- plenty of seating .
there are even quiet rooms if you need the extra silence .
- the children 's area .
i 'm still trying to get him interested in the actual books though .
they also have story time in a separate room there .
the rainbow lights of the librarian 's desk also entertain my son .
- the checkout area .
i 've never seen anything like it .
- the outside book return .
you do n't have to park or get out of your car .
easy !
i 'm in this library as i type .
it 's the fourth time since it 's been remodeled .
plenty of large tables to get down and dirty with calculus on .
there is a cafe .
the audio visual rental selection is quite large too .
whatever .
so , yeah .
here 's a review .
i should study now .
love this place !
who would 've thought i 'd be reviewing a library ?
the building is so cool and modern inside .
with toys , puzzles , and books galore .
the instructors are so talented .
they sing and read books to our babies .
they also bring toys for them to play with .
my little girl loves it !
and loves to be with the other babies as well .
awesome !
this library is amazing !
the kids area is awesome !
their media section is also huge .
check out is fast and easy with the `` self checkout '' stations .
it 's the best library i have ever been to - seriously .
he could n't believe the changes .
it 's a beautiful building with plenty of space and friendly staff .
now if only i could get a library card !
i just have to prove i live here ... hm ...
i absolutely love this library .
no doubt they are one of top _num_ libraries in the country .
let 's put my qualifications out on the table first , shall we ?
looks aside , the library is filled with everything a bibliophile could hope for .
shelves and shelves of books , organized so intuitively and neatly .
computer terminals at all the right places for catalog searching .
huge tables and quiet areas for studying and researching .
and the cherry on top ?
a small cafe downstairs to supply a book 's best companion - coffee .
what more could i want ? ? ?
oh yeah , the amazingly awesome super cool checkout system .
great place to pick up movies and books and relax .
it 's nice to get off campus and see `` real people '' .
the automated checkout system is fantastic .
one drawback is noise level .
loud cellphone conversations are as common here as anywhere .
this place is the worst .
i thought that was the point of a library ?
to excite people about reading and give free access to all .
also , they have a rather fantastic collection of cds .
big tables are great for spreading out .
also : wifi is free , but only if you have a library card .
not sure how it works if you do not have a library card .
i love the library .
- tons of window light
- cafe with tasty treats and lattes
- free wifi
- lots of table space
- great book selection
- lots of dvds/bds
other towns residents can also use the library with some restrictions .
in summary , a place to go for everyone , rich or poor .
sure the building is somewhat pretty .
however , that does n't make up for the rude service .
good .
reason .
they are constantly hovering around groups .
the library is slowly losing it 's funding and not making much profit .
i now understand why .
this is a wonderful library !
i love that you can rent dvds and cds for free .
the employees are always very helpful and informative .
landmark review :
cpl = the new barnes and noble .
let me list them here
_num_ .
it is super easy to get a card .
you hop on a computer and put in your information to obtain a card .
_num_ .
electronic resource galore : they have zinio , hoopla for online movies and cd rental
_num_ .
computer stations everywhere and in the kids section they allow video games to be played
_num_ .
large dvd , blue ray , and video game section .
_num_ .
large library catalog , you can find likely anything here
_num_ .
hidden deal : everything above and more !
i 've been a loyal cpl goer for many years .
the library has so many benefits for families and individuals .
the children 's book selection is enormous .
the checkout is a breeze with the electronic tags found in every book .
nothing difficult about that .
there 's always been someone there to ask questions if needed .
great library .
terrible staff .
they are rude to their customers and act way more important than they are .
i explained to them that due to a condition i could not sit differently .
they again asked me to move .
the gentleman that works on the children 's department is amazing .
my 4yo daughter loves when he does story time .
the reading programs keep my daughter wanting to come back every week .
prices on-campus are comparable to the rest of campus properties .
year-long leases only , and you will never get anything subleased if needed .
_num_ cats are ok in most places , no dogs .
slow to plow parking lots , but perpetually mow in the summer .
washers and dryers in the complex sometimes work , usually do not .
also , outside and inside lights are quite frequently not working .
you end up with pitch-dark hallways and cul-de-sacs .
maintenance - nonresponsive .
move-in - place was filthy ...
think bugs , unflushed toilet , and food in the carpet .
apartment showings - _num_ days a week people walk through your place .
exactly .
every single item on the list was checked to be cleaned .
every single one .
i was even charged a fee to clean those off .
i agree with jenna m. - barr real estate is terrible !
but the heat/cooling system always breaks , and i was freezing all winter .
and you should n't either ...
i was happy enough with my apartment with barr .
a good apartment for the price .
what i have a beef with is their assessment of cleaning upon moving out .
that is outrageous and appalling .
i would have cleaned it had i known i was supposed to .
here 's my experience from moving out of a barr apartment .
they will just show up .
i felt like i had no privacy at all .
this lasted at least _num_ months .
before moving out they give you a move out checklist .
in my google web albums , please decide for yourself .
this is not an uncommon example , as you can see from other reviews .
cleaning charges :

mcelroy is phenomenal .
compassionate and thorough , yet cost-conscious if that matters to you .
took _num_ cats there .
do n't recommend the shorter chick , though .
dr. dust may be the most compassionate vet i 've ever met .
part psychiatrist part vet but all wonderful .
been happy with dr. mcelroy .
neitzel and dust .
we now see drs .
i 've been taking my cat here for many years .
he sees dr. dust and i 've been incredibly happy with my visits here .
he explained everything in detail and always asked for my approval before doing anything .
their prices are probably on the high end , but not unreasonable .
dr. dust and the rest of the staff are all wonderful .
the staff was great and dr. dust was wonderful .
i liked that the waiting areas for dogs and cats were separated too .
parking is easy and the location is terrific .
two paws up .
: )
this is the best clinic i have used .
seems like you ca n't go wrong with any of the vets here .
so impressed with this facility .
thank you for not steering me wrong yelpers ! !
dr. rhodes was awesome .
she listened to my concerns and was incredibly receptive to my thoughts and opinions .
we have found our forever vet !
!
he said it was nothing to worry about .
i felt so much better .
i take my cat and my dog here .
the staff are really great with them .
bleeding gums , too skinny , torn pads , and whip worm .
the staff are really nice .
even the cats likes them .
i highly recommend them .
took them to vca and all it was was a bladder infection !
we will work with you ! ''
love this clinic and what they stand for !
thank you !
: )
my cat received great care from dr. mcelroy at vca .
his backside was very red , swollen , and tender .
he 's now eating a wet food that he loves .
he also had an infection in his ear that she prescribed an ointment for .
this cat mama is very appreciative of you , dr. mcelroy !
i 'll update again after several more appointments .
after my first experience , i agree .
for new clients , they provide a totally free check-up .
this does n't include vaccinations or anything .
the veterinarian was wonderful !
i was very happy with the staff .
another big up vote for vca .
i 'm grateful to yelp for steering me towards vca .
they are very warm and thoughtful .
i love coming to this clinic !
everyone is always very nice and helpful .
i take my cat to dr. mcelroy and she is great .
i will continue to bring my pet here for all his health care needs !
a great place .
vca was great through the whole process .
costs were reasonable .
we 've been taking our new dogs there ever since .
i love vca !
they are always helpful and take extremely good care of my dog .
my dog likes all of the vet techs and especially loves dr dust !
!
do not go there !
i had the very same experience as sarah .
i will never go back to this place .
what ! ?
three words don ; t go here ! !
!
i think i was his first client .
he had nail polish all over his hands and my toes .
i literally started laughing because it was so absurdly bad .
i am very disappointed in the pedicure i received today .
the whole experience was rushed , which made me feel very uncomfortable .
i was looking forward to a relaxing experience & it did not happen .
this lady ( the owner ) had an overall rough touch .
i am positive that i will never be back to this place .
they always do a great job on my eyebrows !
i never go anywhere else !
ask for phien , she is the best !
she is also very friendly !
my wife and i been here several times and were very happy every time .
maybe they got new staff in the _num_ years since the last review ?
i have no problem recommending this to my friends .
my favorite venue in cu .
affordable tickets .
excellent sound .
easy access to drinking with the bar wrapped around the `` center '' wall .
and cheap drinks .
how i miss it .
yay !
i am a fan !
my one complaint is the parking situation .
sorry ... ) , and the highdive does not have its own lot .
there are no un-metered spots for miles .
this place is decent .
the layout is very strange .
it seems like an old restaurant with a stage in it .
the drinks on hand were pretty cool .
is it like going to the metro in chicago ?
is it like going to the orpheum in madison ?
much better , actually .
it 's a very tolerable and enjoyable venue .
i 'd easily recomend this for anyone in central illinois to check out .
i 've never been here for a show ... well , let me clarify .
things usually devolve into a shit show .
never was disappointed once .
you wo n't regret it ( and you might not remember it ) .
very intimate venue to see your fave bands play with good food and libations .
it 's an intimate concert venue/bar , and we had a great time .
if you 're coming to a show , get there early to snag seating .
we found great seats up in balcony , which had it 's own bar .
were the bar stools and benches comfortable ?
hell no .
folks , this is your quintessential small town concert venue .
great prices , great service , great music .
canadian honky-tonk at its finest !
what i like most was the vibes - this place has character .
i like it .
the view and sound is fantastic .
all towns would be so lucky to have a music venue like the highdive .
worst bar i 've ever been too .
would never recommend to anyone .
pay $ _num_ dollars for cover and expect a complete waste of your money .
never will come back .
ever .
the bouncer was very casual and stamped your hand if you were underage .
cash is preferred , but i do believe they take debit/credit .
since the space is so small , but sound was very loud .
the atmosphere is cozy , completed with dark colors and exposed brick .
there are a few tables as well as the bar to sit at .
he filled my water three times and i was very grateful .
when the band played , my friend and i stood in the middle .
the high dive would be a great experience if you were into the band .
overall , i am glad i went and i will surely be going again .
i was here a few weeks ago for the claw event .
it was amazing !
there 's a great stage for viewing the acts .
there is a bartender here with impressive mixology skils !
great night , music was really good .
disgraceful !
anyone could have taken it !
this is a lovely venue .
they serve drinks in real glasses and the prices were n't horrible .
the sound was nearly perfect .
i would love to come back .
it 's a great location in downtown champaign .
this is what i would call a sweet book shop .
well it is .
you will walk in searching for something and walk out found .
jane , you will make this move a lot easier .
i always find something unique when i shop here .
a great place to explore , and a real hidden treasure of champaign-urbana .
this is one of my favorite places in cu .
the first time i went there i was astounded by how huge it was .
there are three floors full of every kind of book you 'd want .
there are so many treasures to find here .
sometimes you have to dig a bit but it 's well worth it .
it 's now under new ownership but have no fear !
they 've already done a great job .
not sure they 're there yet but they 're trying .
i love used book stores and this one did n't disappoint .
and they were only $ _num_ each .
a total steal !
so they definitely had a nice children 's section .
as a total bookworm , let me just say that i adore this place .
upstairs is a maze of tiny rooms , each devoted to their own subject .
the staff is great .
the inventory is mind-blowing , and it is locally-owned !
i 'm a former literature professor with broad tastes in reading .
jane addams satisfies them .
do n't expect bargain prices .
the prices are often good , but not exceptionally good .
the new owners are much more welcoming , and now i go regularly again .
they know their stock and are glad to help you look for something .
but , really , browsing is the best part of the experience .
a great independent book store .
there is a great feel here , with books piled everywhere .
cramped narrow allies between the shelves .
deceivingly large though .
there are three stories of books in all genres .
the owner is great and she will help you find anything you want .
i have found great gifts here as well as stuff i want to read .
i could spend months in this store .
they have a giant selection .
old books , paper bag , rain storm , not a god combo .
i love this treasure .
i would say `` little '' treasure but it is n't little .
jane adams has a wildly big selection of unique books .
the only problem i ever have if going in and deciding on just a couple
my favorite book store in the area .
i love how spacious the location is , with it 's three floors .
you can get a lot of in-store credit for what you have .
definitely something i have taken advantage of over the years .
i love this little bookstore in champaign !
here 's the deets : everything .
if only i had more time today .
i like big books and i can not lie .
loving it !
i 'll be back .
for a small town like chambana , this is pretty good .
oh , did i tell you they have a carousel too ?
pretty rad .
this is one of the better malls in this area .
they have a variety of stores for men , women , and kids .
there are no empty stores and it does get busy at the mall .
they have a great steak and potato company which closed in springfield years ago .
i like all the speciality stores that are here .
a pretty decent mall , a few too many empty stores of late though .
the food court is okay .
the carousel is real cool looking .
i 'm afraid my _num_ year old will get hurt !
security should not allow parents to drop their kids off and leave them unattended .
small .
food court is n't that great .
list of stores : http : //www.marketplacemall.com/directory
stay away from the children 's place !
's .
not even a hello or good morning !
i told her that i was looking to get my son some p.j .
's , and with that she said `` oh ...
carry on ! ''
i was like , wtf ! ?
she then said with a huff , `` fine !
`` , and mumbled something under breath .
landmark review :
there are not too many amenities compared to the other malls .
hidden deals :
_num_ .
nice food court
_num_ .
carousel
_num_ .
free kids play area
a pretty plain regular mall just like the other thousands .
i used to go to wet seal , forever _num_ .
like calvin klein .
nice mall great stores and food court but they need more seating for people .
nice mall with lots of fun shops .
my favorite is macy 's and white house black market .
my daughter wanted her hair done so they started to curl it .
kind of awkward walking around the mall with half of your hair curled .
do n't make eye contact is the best bet .
the food court is pretty cool too .
they have a carasoul and some of the places hand out free samples .
this mall has really gone downhill in the past few years .
it seems as though no stores can survive there .
if a hollister ca n't survive i 'm not sure what can .
the food court is really nothing special .
pretty disappointing .
good ole market place .
i 've had the most luck at bergner 's .
my parents also shop there the most .
there are kiosks in the aisle .
i do n't use frequent these much .
but did purchase some cheap _num_ scarves last winter .
cool .
during the holidays , there is usually gift wrapping and an angel tree .
great for a small town mall .
carousel rides have doubled in price .
bathrooms are always nasty .
do they purposely hire anti-social custodians ?
two people sitting at front desks looked almost surprised that a customer walked in .
the person then said , `` so do you need help ? ''
i left the place and will not recommend it .
they do n't know their head from their ass .
i called over looking for a magnepull .
they said they had one and then quoted me a price .
i thanked them for checking .
the guy said they did n't sell anything like that .
it 's so rare to have that kind of experience any more .
we really appreciate it !
horrible customer service ... .horrible .
if you go to.the.contractor counter and try.and get.served.good luck .
_num_ people behind counter but i couldnt get waited on .
if your not an electrician they.know , its like who.cares .
rude rude rude .
i forgot how bad they.are .
will never walk in store again .
they always s have what i 'm looking for .
happy shopping !
the scam of the century !
i 'm still horrified !
please do not believe the shop assistants in this store !
we bought a sleep number mattress in this store in january .
the warranty- we were told sure no problem !
the warranty will be valid , just need to contact customer service .
well , we are in europe now after paying _num_ $ for this bed .
! - second disgraceful lie
and best ...
they offer us a _num_ % off on a new pump but ...
they are not able to ship anything outside usa ! ! !
?
!
i ordered my bed on 8/31 during the labor day sale .
the people at the chandler store were very nice .
they said that the bed would take 2-3 weeks for delivery .
this required me to take a day off from work to receive the bed .
today is saturday 9/27 and i have not heard from anyone .
i will have to take another day off just to receive this bed .
i feel like i am not a very valued customer .
not sure if ready to buy but wanted to explore the product !
the store was `` white-glove '' clean and the atmosphere felt warm and inviting !
was asked my preference of pillow ( i am a soft ! )
lol ! !
fyi ... forget to say ... .
i am a `` _num_ '' ! !
: )
he offered to see what we could get out by buffing the scratch .
i plan to go to ivey 's for any future car needs .
the minute i pulled in mr. ivey was there to help me .
he would n't even let me do that .
he just asked i remember him if i got in an accident .
ivey 's quality of work is superb and i can recommend him wihtout hesitation .
i would definitely take my car there again .
they did a great job and are really decent people .
however , do n't let its appearance fool you .
i brought the car in and meet doug .
doug was very friendly and professional .
he definitely knows what he is doing and is very good at it .
our car got hit and needed a paint job on the front bumper .
no fuss .
totally recommend .
top flight service , excellent work .
two cars damaged within a week due to winter weather .
highly recommended .
great place !
had my entire bumper replaced after a winter collision .
prices are very reasonable .
best price i found in champaign area .
great service , the guys are awesome .
i 'll use ivey again if i ever need to in the future !
car was finished the day after i dropped it off
nice hotel .
good rate , via online weekend deals .
great free breakfast .
bed was comfy .
no complaints about room or service .
upgrade over other budget places .
would stay again .
we spent one night at the la quinta inn in champaign while attending ebertfest .
handicapped-accessible primarily meant a larger bathroom/bathtub , which is always a good thing .
stayed just for a day while visiting friends in urbana .
many restaurants and businesses within walking distance , making this a convenient location .
clean as a whistle .
good beds .
good shower .
carpet seemed very new and clean .
breakfast was good .
nothin fancy .
coffee was very good .
friendly people at the desk .
good price .
i will be back ! !
!
i was not satisfied with my stay .
i am very pleased with this hotel .
clean , nicely decorated , close to the highway .
cozy little exercise room with newer equipment .
i definitely feel like i got my money 's worth .
nice , modern , clean rooms .
very comfortable beds .
very friendly staff .
this recently remodeled hotel was perfect for our two night stay for a wedding .
the rooms were clean and nicely decorated .
the main lobby was very nice !
i took it back to my room .
the pool looked nice , we ran out of time to use it .
i would definitely stay there again !
here 's what i liked :
-it 's a real bargain .
-the staff was all friendly .
-the bed was comfortable , and the room was clean .
-they offer free breakfast , but be warned : it 's carb overload .
since i do n't eat wheat , i did n't have anything .
but still , it 's a nice touch .
-free wifi !
and here 's what i did n't love :
-the rooms still feel cheap even with the updates .
but hey , you get what you pay for .
-it 's really easy to hear every little thing outside the room .
get ready to hear everything in the hallway and outside at the pool .
it was move in day for my daughter at uiuc college .
i was pleasantly surprised .
it was very clean , beds comfortable , breakfast was very nice .
the bathrooms were a bit small but overall the room was very comfortable .
it is next to many restaurants and a mall and easy access to uiuc .
i would stay here again without hesitation .
i prefer non carpeted rooms .
whatever , i like this place and i got a great deal .
the staff was friendly .
the room was comfortable .
pretty good for a national cost saver property .
cheers !
we were very happy with our stay .
the staff was friendly and helpful .
our room was spacious , clean , and smelled fresh .
the bed was so comfortable .
the continental breakfast is nothing but carbs .
no good balance with proteins .
everything smells like stale hairspray and old smoke .
the rooms are quaint and clean .
it had a cheap feel to it .
there was a time _num_ years ago when la quinta was a quality brand .
not anymore .
the front deck clerk was somewhat arrogant and the breakfast was chintzy .
what really irritated me was the pricing .
a king bed is $ _num_ more than two beds .
have you ever tried to sleep with your mate in a double bed ?
i would like to liken this to extortion .
we arrived to find our room exactly as we expected .
it was comfortable , quiet and in an excellent location .
they welcomed our small dog with a doggie biscuit as well .
thank you for a nice stay .
hey , i 'm pretty easy to please when it comes to business travel .
that 's what i got here , and i got it at a bargain .
the room was less than $ 70/night , and it was a steal .
that 's not a huge deal though .
bonus points for breakfast .
talk about shock value !
free .
then i read about a previous issue bedbugs , as we drove into town .
when we got to our king suite , i was pleasantly surprised .
pretty clean .
it looks like an airport meets target .
i do n't know how better to describe it .
walls are stucco-textured .
i 'd give the spot a `` totally fine '' overall .
yes , please !
we will absolutely be back .
i would stay here again , rooms are very nice and up-to-date .
better than most chain pizza , it 's ok .
it also has a really friendly , laid-back atmosphere .
its awful cardboard with some sauce and cheese on top .
i love monicals .
always good to have some `` hometown taste '' when visiting .
i love monicals and you ca n't beat the family deal .
formidwextern pizza , monicals is hands down my favorite .
recommended .
also watch out for their coupons in the mail .
i eat here occasionally because it is by my work .
over the top loud .
i had a very hard time hearing anything my friend said .
we finished our food and got out of there so we could visit .
it took _num_ minutes for her to come and take our drink order .
i swear we did not do anything to make her mad .
and that really made her madder .
oh dear !
the salad was cold and fresh and the dressing was really good .
i nearly always grab carry-out .
they really need to work out the parking situation .
both times we also had poor service .
this is my least favorite location in champaign .
i prefer to drive to the location in tolono .
i did not like the pizza .
the mozzarella sticks were okay .
the waitress seemed to be a little rude .
three stars because of nostalgia .
monical 's has always been around , as long as i can remember .
pizza is average , thin crust in little squares that is pretty soggy .
the family pleaser is what we always get .
which just adds an iceburg lettuce salad and soft drinks to a pizza order .
nothing bad , but nothing great either .
i really enjoyed my pizza at monical 's .
to me , having eaten here during my graduate school days .
a schoolmate advised me to ask for their french dressing on my pizza .
it was absurd , of course , but tasted fantastic .
now i wo n't get it any other way .
thanks for the memories , monical 's .
this monical person is only really good at making average pizza .
we ordered the stuffed pizza .
it was fabulous !
and it comes with _num_ toppings for under $ _num_ .
you got ta try it !
i can not believe monicals gets such low ratings .
they have the best thin crust i 've ever tasted .
and yes , do put the french dressing on the za !
my favorite pizza place when i come to visit my family up this way .
worked at one when i was _num_ lol .
